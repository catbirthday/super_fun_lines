Character 1: Got the permit today.

822 Character 2: Wait wait wait—the downtown one? The spot by the—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's literally the best corner in the whole city!

Character 1: Yeah. Corner of Fifth and Market.

823 Character 2: I'm gonna—[Gasp] okay I'm actually freaking out for you right now! How long did you wait for this? Like six months?

Character 1: Eight.

824 Character 2: Eight months. Jesus. And you just—you're so calm about it! I'd be like, screaming or crying or I dunno, both probably. When do you start?

Character 1: Next Tuesday. If the truck's ready.

825 Character 2: If the—wait, what d'you mean if? Is something wrong with it? Because honestly this timing needs to be perfect, y'know?

Character 1: Generator's acting up. Might need a new one.

826 Character 2: Oh no no no, not now—that's like, that's so typical though, right? [Sigh] The second something good happens, boom, universe throws you a curveball.

Character 1: It'll work out. Or it won't.

827 Character 2: Okay, that's—you can't be all zen about this! This is huge! Your tacos are gonna be right there where literally everyone walks by during lunch.

Character 1: I know.

828 Character 2: Do you though? Because like, I feel like you're not processing how—this changes everything. You're gonna need help, right? More ingredients, maybe another person?

Character 1: Probably. Haven't thought that far.

829 Character 2: You haven't—[Laugh] of course you haven't. Classic. But seriously though, this is what you've been working toward, like, forever basically.

Character 1: Since dad died, yeah.

830 Character 2: Oh. Oh honey, I—he would've been so proud, y'know? His recipes finally getting the spot they deserve. That's... that's really something.

Character 1: Think I'll name a taco after him.

831 Character 2: That's—okay now you're gonna make me cry. That's perfect. He'd probably make some terrible dad joke about it too, wouldn't he?

Script: ca581f44_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Sophie got into Yale.

832 Character 2: Wait wait wait—YALE? Like, Yale Yale? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! I mean, I knew she was brilliant but this is just... wow. You must be so proud right now!

Character 1: Yeah. It's good.

833 Character 2: Good? It's— [Laugh] okay, you're being so casual about this but like, this is huge! When did you find out? Was it one of those, um, those big envelope things?

Character 1: Email. This morning.

834 Character 2: Of course it's email now, right? Everything's—but still! God, I bet Sophie's just over the moon. Is she like, freaking out? I would be literally bouncing off the walls.

Character 1: She cried. Then called everyone she knows.

835 Character 2: Aww, that's so—see, that's exactly what she should do! Let her have this moment, y'know? It's like... all those late nights, all that stress. Finally paying off. [Sigh] Must feel amazing.

Character 1: The tuition though.

836 Character 2: Oh. Oh yeah, that's—I mean, it's Yale, so it's gonna be... yeah. But they have financial aid, right? Like, really good programs? I dunno, maybe there's scholarships or something?

Character 1: We'll figure it out.

837 Character 2: You will, you totally will. And honestly? Sophie at Yale is just—it's so right, you know? She's gonna absolutely thrive there. Have you told your parents yet?

Character 1: Mom screamed. Dad's already buying Yale merch.

838 Character 2: [Laugh] Stop, that's so—that's so them! Your dad's probably gonna wear that sweatshirt everywhere now, like to the grocery store and everything. "Oh, did I mention my granddaughter goes to YALE?"

Character 1: He ordered a car decal.

839 Character 2: No no no, he didn't! That's—okay that's actually adorable though. He's just so proud. I mean, we all are, but grandparents are like... next level with this stuff, right?

Character 1: Sophie's nervous now. Says everyone will be smarter.

840 Character 2: Oh honey, that's so—that's totally normal though. Like, imposter syndrome is real, especially with these big schools. But they picked her, y'know? Out of thousands and thousands of kids, they wanted Sophie.

Character 1: I know. Just want her to be happy.

841 Character 2: She will be. She's—I mean, she's got you, right? And that matters more than any fancy school. But also? [Chuckle] Yale though. Like, damn. Your kid's going to Yale.

Script: 9a6e7626_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I signed the papers today.

842 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you closed? You actually closed on the house? Oh my god, I can't—this is huge! Like, this is literally your dream house, right? The one with the, um, the sunroom?

Character 1: Yeah. That one.

843 Character 2: I'm gonna cry, honestly I might actually [Laugh] cry right now because you've been talking about this for what—three years? Four? And now it's like, it's yours. It's actually yours!

Character 1: Feels weird. Like I'm trespassing or something.

844 Character 2: No no no, that's—that's totally normal though! My sister said the same thing when she bought her place. Like you're waiting for someone to be like "excuse me, what are you doing here?" But it's yours, babe. Yours.

Character 1: The kitchen needs work.

845 Character 2: Okay but didn't you say—wait, didn't you specifically want a fixer-upper? Because you're all about those, um, those weekend projects? You literally [Groan] made me watch seventeen episodes of that renovation show.

Character 1: Sixteen episodes. And yeah, I guess I did say that.

846 Character 2: You guess? You were like—you were basically obsessed with finding something you could make your own. Remember? You said cookie-cutter houses made you wanna scream.

Character 1: Still might scream. Different reasons though.

847 Character 2: Oh god, what happened? Did they—please don't tell me something's wrong already. I mean, besides the kitchen thing.

Character 1: Nothing's wrong. Just... expensive. Very expensive.

848 Character 2: Yeah but like—okay, yeah, houses are basically [Sigh] insane right now. But you did it! You actually did it when everyone's saying it's impossible, y'know? That's kinda badass, honestly.

Character 1: My dad thinks I'm an idiot.

849 Character 2: Your dad thinks—okay, sorry, but your dad also thinks cryptocurrency is a scam and restaurants should still cost what they did in 1987, so maybe we don't, um, maybe we don't take his financial advice?

Character 1: Fair point. He did say the backyard was nice though.

850 Character 2: See? Even he—even your impossible-to-please father found something good! And that backyard is gonna be amazing for like, summer barbecues and stuff. Oh! Can I help you paint?

Character 1: You hate painting. You literally left halfway through your bathroom.

851 Character 2: Okay that's—[Laugh] that's different! That was my bathroom and I was having a whole crisis about the color. But your house? I dunno, I'm like, weirdly excited about it? Is that weird?

Script: d94f5a6f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: It's done.

852 Character 2: Wait wait wait—the thing? The project you've been—oh my god, are you serious? You actually finished it?

Character 1: Three years, four months, twelve days. But yeah.

853 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry right now. Like, do you even realize how huge this is? You've been talking about this since we met!

Character 1: I know.

854 Character 2: So like... how do you feel? Are you—I mean, you must be completely exhausted, right? Or like, relieved? Both? [Laugh] Sorry, I'm just so excited for you.

Character 1: Mostly just... empty. Is that weird?

855 Character 2: No no no, that's—honestly? That's totally normal. You just poured years of yourself into something and now it's like... done. Of course you feel empty.

Character 1: I keep opening the file to change things. Then I close it.

856 Character 2: Oh babe, you gotta—okay, you know what? Delete it from your computer. Like, put it on a hard drive or whatever and just... let it be finished, y'know?

Character 1: What if it's terrible?

857 Character 2: Okay, um, absolutely not. We're not—we're not doing this. You're way too close to it right now to judge anything. [Sigh] Trust me, it's probably incredible.

Character 1: You haven't even seen it.

858 Character 2: I don't—I don't have to? I've watched you basically kill yourself over this thing for three years. Nobody puts that kind of energy into something terrible.

Character 1: My cousin made a terrible novel. Took him five years.

859 Character 2: Your cousin's novel about the—wait, the sexy vampires who run a food truck? That's different and you know it. [Chuckle] Completely different energy here.

Character 1: Fair point.

860 Character 2: So what's next? Are you gonna, like, show people? Submit it places? Or do you need to just... sit with it for a while?

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe nothing. Maybe I just needed to finish it.

861 Character 2: And that's—hey, that's enough, honestly. Finishing something you care about? That's literally everything. Most people never even get there, y'know?

862 SCENARIO: attempting to hang a picture straight

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I just need to, um— I just need to hang this one little picture. How hard can it be, right? I've got the nail, I've got the, uh, the hammer, and I've got— [sigh] I've got absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

[slightly more confident]

But it's fine, it's— it's just one nail. I mean, people do this all the time, so, um, so I can figure this out. Let me just eyeball it here and— okay, that looks about right? Maybe a little to the left, or, uh, or maybe—

[frustrated]

No, wait, that's— that's definitely crooked. Like, really crooked. How did I— how did I mess that up already? I literally just held it up for two seconds and somehow it's, um, it's like completely sideways now.

[determined]

Okay okay okay, let me try this again. So if I hold it here, and then I mark where the, uh, where the nail should go— but what if the string thing is longer than I think? Or shorter? I should probably measure this, shouldn't I?

[deflated]

Or I could just, um, I could just lean it against the wall on that little table thing. That's, uh— that's basically the same as hanging it, right? [laugh] Right. Problem solved.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 4ff39e40 | Role: Character 1 (A)

863 Character 1: [disbelief] Marcus? [voice cracking] They paired us for tomorrow's match? [slower] After everything we've survived together, side by side in this pit, they want us to— [bitter laugh] The crowd will love this spectacle of betrayal.

Character 2: [hollow tone] I heard the announcement moments ago. [quieter] Five years, brother. [building rage] Five years we've watched each other's backs, and now they expect me to drive steel through yours for their entertainment!

864 Character 1: [shouting] I won't do it! [more desperately] There has to be another way—we could refuse, both of us, stand together like we always have. What can they do, kill us both? [dark chuckle] At least we'd die as brothers.

Character 2: [weary] You know what happens to gladiators who refuse. [harsher] They'll make an example—torture, starvation, then feed us to the lions anyway. [whispered] My daughter visits next week; I promised her I'd still be breathing.

865 Character 1: [anguished cry] Don't speak of family! [trembling] My son thinks I'm a hero, not a murderer of friends. How do I explain that daddy killed uncle Marcus because rich men demanded blood for their feast?

Character 2: [cold fury] Perhaps we give them blood then. [faster] Not ours—theirs. [growled whisper] When we enter that arena, we turn our swords on the emperor's box instead. Die as warriors, not as their puppets dancing on strings.

866 Character 1: [hushed urgency] You're talking madness, Marcus. [steadier] The archers would cut us down before we reached the wall. [pleading] But what if we made it look real—fight, but miss the vital spots?

Character 2: [sarcastic] Oh brilliant, we'll just pretend. [more bitterly] You think they're stupid? [rising pitch] The crowd bays for death—they know when blood isn't flowing freely enough. They'll demand a proper ending regardless.

867 Character 1: [breaking voice] Remember our first fight together? [softer] Back to back against six men, you said we'd make it through anything. [angry shout] Was that all lies? Are we just meat now, nothing more than tomorrow's corpses?

Character 2: [pained whisper] That was before I knew the price. [stronger] Before I understood that friendship is a luxury gladiators can't afford. [choking up] Tomorrow, one of us dies so the other's family might eat another month.

868 Character 1: [desperately fast] What if we both wound each other—badly—too injured to continue? [hopeful] They'd have to stop the match, call it a draw. [trailing off] The crowd gets blood, we both survive to fight another day.

Character 2: [tired laugh] You're grasping at dreams now, brother. [grimly] The emperor wants a victor tomorrow—he's betting against me apparently. [venomous] Three thousand gold pieces says you'll be standing over my corpse by noon.

869 Character 1: [roaring] Then he's lost his gold! [quieter menace] Because if I must kill you, Marcus, I'll fall on my sword right after. [measured pace] Let him explain two dead champions to his precious mob.

Character 2: [stunned silence] Don't you dare. [building fury] Don't you dare make me carry that burden—knowing you died because of me! [shouting] If anyone falls on their sword tomorrow, it's me, not you, understand?

870 Character 1: [hysterical laughter] Listen to us! [more frantically] Fighting over who gets to die with honor while those bastards place bets on our blood! [gasping] We're already dead men, just arguing over the funeral arrangements.

Character 2: [quietly resolved] Then we make it memorable. [steadier] Give them the greatest fight they've ever seen—honor our brotherhood one last time. [thick voice] When the killing blow comes, at least it's from someone who matters.

871 Character 1: [wavering] I can't—Marcus, I can't look you in the eyes and— [sharp breath] Your wife, your daughter, they'll hate me forever. [anguished whisper] How do I live knowing I orphaned a child I've held in my arms?

Character 2: [gently] They'll understand. [more firmly] I've already told them—if I fall to anyone, I'm glad it's you. [ragged breathing] Promise me you'll check on them, tell my daughter her father died bravely.

872 Character 1: [sobbing anger] Stop talking like you've already lost! [determined growl] We're the best fighters in this whole cursed place. [rising conviction] Tomorrow, we show them what happens when they force brothers to bleed—we'll make them regret this choice.

Character 2: [exhausted acceptance] Dawn comes either way, brother. [slower] Tonight we drink like free men, tomorrow we die as slaves. [final whisper] But between us, here and now, we're still family—that's what I'll remember when steel meets flesh.

Script: b901eedf | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [mumbling] Yeah, so the thing won't... won't turn on, and I tried the, uh, [frustrated] the button thing on the side? [louder] It's model X-47... no wait, XL-74B, I think.

873 Customer Support: [cheerfully] I'd be happy to help you today! Can you please verify the full model number on the bottom of your device? It should start with XL dash, followed by four digits.

Character 1: [confused] Bottom? Oh, okay, hold on... [straining] I see... X... L... 7... 4... [unsure] 2... 8? Or maybe that's a B? [sighs] These numbers are so tiny!

874 Customer Support: [patiently] That's XL-7428, perfect! Now, can you confirm your account number for me? It's the eight-digit code starting with three that we emailed you on March 15th.

Character 1: [rustling sounds] March... March... [muttering quickly] I have so many emails, um, is it 3-3-5... no that's my parking spot. [suddenly loud] Oh! 33847291! [quieter] Is that it?

875 Customer Support: Excellent, Mr. Johnson! Now let's get your device working. First, please locate the power port—it's a small circular opening [slower] on the left side, not the right.

Character 1: [confused] Left side when I'm looking at it, or [trails off] when it's facing me? [groans] Because there's a square hole here and a... [hopefully] oh wait, found a round one!

876 Customer Support: [encouragingly] Perfect! Now plug in the power cable—the one with the blue stripe. Hold the reset button for exactly fifteen seconds while it's plugged in. You'll hear two beeps.

Character 1: [counting fast] One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Miss— [interrupts himself] Wait, which button? [panicking] There's like four buttons here! [calmer] The red one or the tiny black one near the... the thingy?

877 Customer Support: [soothingly] The small black button, yes! [reassuring] It's located right next to the LED indicator light. [patiently] Just press and hold for fifteen seconds—I'll count with you if you'd like.

Character 1: [determined] Okay, okay, pressing now... [counting slowly] one... two... three... [excited] Oh! Something's happening! [confused again] But it's just one beep, not two?

878 Customer Support: One beep means it's initializing. You should see lights flashing in sequence—red, blue, then green. Are you seeing that pattern, or something different?

Character 1: [squinting] I see... red... red... [frustrated] still red... oh wait! [triumphant] Blue! And now it's... [disappointed] back to red again. Is that normal?

879 Customer Support: That indicates a firmware issue. We'll need to manually update it. [clearly] Can you read me the serial number? It starts with SN, followed by twelve characters.

Character 1: [straining] S... N... [slowly] zero or O? Let's say zero... 4... K... [mumbles] T... 9... M... [sighs] This is impossible... X... 2... L... 7... A.

880 Customer Support: SN04KT9MX2L7A, got it! I'm pushing a firmware update to your device now. You'll see a progress bar on the screen in about thirty seconds.

Character 1: [waiting] Nothing yet... still nothing... [suddenly excited] Oh! There's a bar! [worried] But it says 1% and... and estimated time three hours? [desperate] That can't be right!

881 Customer Support: That's just the initial estimate—it usually takes about ten minutes. [encouragingly] Once it hits 5%, it speeds up significantly. You're doing great, by the way!

Character 1: [relieved] Oh good, it's at 8% already! [curious] Hey, while we wait, uh, my warranty code is... [reading] WR2024-[quickly] 5587B, does that cover this kind of thing?

882 Customer Support: Yes, absolutely! That platinum warranty covers all software issues through December 2025. [warmly] And look—you should be seeing "Setup Complete" right about... [triumphant] now! How's it looking?

Script: 901616cd | Role: Customer Support

883 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is Premier Dry Cleaning. How can I assist you today? [sighs quietly] We're quite busy, so please be brief.

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, hi, I dropped off my grandmother's vintage coat last Tuesday and—[voice breaking] well, when I came to pick it up, they couldn't find it. [desperately] It's irreplaceable!

884 Customer Support: Oh dear, I'm terribly sorry to hear that. Let me pull up your account—what's the claim number on your receipt? We'll sort this out right away.

Character 1: [anxiously] It's, um, 4-7-2... no wait, [groans] 4-2-7-9-B. [pleadingly] Look, this coat means everything to me—she wore it to her wedding in 1952!

885 Customer Support: Okay, I see it here in our system. It says the item was logged but... hmm, there's a note about it being transferred to our specialty cleaning facility.

Character 1: [confused] Specialty facility? [more loudly] Nobody told me about any transfer! [accusingly] Your staff said it would be ready in three days, regular cleaning!

886 Customer Support: Sometimes our team makes that decision if they notice delicate fabrics. But you're right, someone should've called. Let me check with our manager about compensation options.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Compensation? [voice rising] You can't just buy me a new family heirloom! [emotionally] Do you understand what sentimental value means, or is everything just dollars to you people?

887 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, truly I do. [reassuringly] What I meant was—while we locate your coat—we'd like to cover any inconvenience costs. We will find it.

Character 1: [skeptically] You'd better find it. [exhausted] I've already been here three times this week, and each person tells me something different. [bitterly] First it was "tomorrow," then "being pressed," now this.

888 Customer Support: I see all those visits logged here, and you're absolutely right—our communication has been terrible. [determined] I'm personally taking over your case now, no more runaround.

Character 1: [cautiously] Okay, so what exactly are you going to do? [impatiently] Because I need that coat for my daughter's wedding this Saturday—[voice cracking] she wanted to wear grandma's coat for photos.

889 Customer Support: This Saturday? Right, that changes things completely. I'm calling our specialty facility right now while you wait—can you hold for just two minutes?

Character 1: [resigned] Two minutes, fine. [muttering] Though your "two minutes" usually means twenty. [louder] And if it's damaged, I swear I'll—[sighs deeply] just please find it.

890 Customer Support: Great news! They have your coat, perfectly cleaned and preserved. [quickly] There was a tag mix-up, but it's safe and ready for pickup there.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh thank God! [suspiciously] Wait, where is this specialty place? [worried] Please don't tell me it's across town during rush hour traffic.

891 Customer Support: It's... about fifteen miles north, but—wait, wait! We'll have it couriered to you by tomorrow morning, no charge, obviously.

Character 1: [relieved] Tomorrow morning works. [more sternly] But it better be in perfect condition. [tiredly] This whole ordeal has been exhausting, you know—I've lost sleep over this coat.

892 Customer Support: I can only imagine the stress. The courier will arrive between 9 and 11 AM with your coat in protective garment packaging. [warmly] We're also including a complimentary cleaning voucher for the inconvenience.

Character 1: [grudgingly] Well, I suppose that's... acceptable. [sighs] Just make sure that courier actually shows up. [more softly] And thank you for finally taking this seriously—[pause] I really appreciate it.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

893 [Happy] Oh my god, I actually—I can't believe it's done, like, completely finished! [Laugh] This is insane!

894 [Slow] [Sigh] You know what, I'm just gonna sit here for a minute and, um, process that this nightmare is over.

895 [Angry] I swear if anyone asks me to do something like that again, I'm gonna—no, absolutely not. [Groan]

896 [Whisper] Is it really finished though? [Tsk] I keep thinking I missed something, y'know?

897 [Fast] Okay so basically I haven't slept in like three days but who cares because it's done done done! [Chuckle]

898 [Disappointed] Honestly, I thought I'd feel more, I dunno, accomplished or whatever, but I'm just... empty? [Sigh]

899 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, only took me, what—six months longer than planned? [Tsk] I'm such a productivity guru.

900 [Shout] [Happy] Mom! MOM! I finished it—the whole thing!

901 [Sad] It's weird, right, how you work on something for so long and then suddenly it's just—gone? [Slow] Kinda miss it already.

902 [Chuckle] I literally forgot what having free time feels like, um, what do normal people even do?

903 [Angry] [Fast] That was the absolute worst experience of my entire life and I'm never—NEVER—doing anything like that again!

904 [Happy] Wait, can I just—lemme look at it one more time because, I mean, wow. [Laugh] I actually pulled this off!

905 [Whisper] [Slow] Don't jinx it, don't jinx it, but I think... yeah, every single part is complete.

906 [Sarcastic] [Groan] Great, now I gotta find something else to complain about for the next six months.

907 [Disappointed] The thing is—actually, forget it, I'm too tired to even explain why this feels so anticlimactic. [Sigh]

908 [Fast] [Happy] I'm gonna sleep for like a week straight, maybe two, who's counting anymore?

909 [Shout] Finally! [Laugh] FINALLY!

910 [Sad] [Slow] I keep thinking about all the things I coulda done differently, y'know, but I guess it doesn't matter now.

911 [Tsk] [Angry] Three years of my life for this—I mean, it's done, but at what cost, seriously?

912 [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] So, uh, anyone wanna hear about every single microscopic detail of how hard that was?

913 SCENARIO: Frustrated about a confusing tax form, then finds clear instructions online while ranting

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my God, don't even get me started on this stupid tax form. Like, I've been staring at this thing for two hours and I— I literally cannot figure out what they're asking for in section four. 

[annoyed]

It's like they wrote it in a different language or something. "Enter the adjusted basis of your qualified improvement property"— like, what? What does that even mean? I don't have qualified improvement property, I live in a studio apartment!

[increasingly agitated]

And the instructions are just as bad, they're like— they reference other forms that reference other forms and it's just this endless loop of bureaucratic nonsense. I'm about to just hire someone to do this for me, which I can't afford, but—

[surprised]

Oh wait, hold on. I'm— I'm literally Googling this right now while I'm talking to you and there's this website that— 

[relieved] [slightly amazed]

Oh. Oh wow, okay this actually makes sense. So apparently that section is only for like business owners and stuff, so I can just skip it entirely? 

[sheepish] [small laugh]

God, I wasted like two hours getting worked up over something that doesn't even apply to me. There's literally a flowchart here that would've saved me so much time. [chuckle] I should probably start with Google next time instead of just panicking.
