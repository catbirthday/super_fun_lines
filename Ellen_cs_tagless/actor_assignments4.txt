Character 1: So. The launch happened.

233 Character 2: Wait wait wait—the launch? THE launch? Oh my god, how did it—actually no, first tell me, like, are you okay? You must be exhausted.

Character 1: Sold out in four hours.

234 Character 2: Four—[Gasp] are you kidding me right now? That's like, that's literally insane! All of it? Even the, um, what was it—the highlighter collection?

Character 1: Everything. The website crashed twice.

235 Character 2: Stop it. Stop—okay that's actually iconic though? Like your website literally couldn't handle how badly people wanted your stuff. That's—wow. How are you feeling about it?

Character 1: I don't know. Weird.

236 Character 2: Weird like... good weird or like "I wanna hide under my blanket for a week" weird? Because honestly both are, y'know, totally valid responses to becoming basically overnight successful.

Character 1: Both? I kept refreshing the sales page thinking it was broken.

237 Character 2: No no no, babe, it wasn't broken—people just really, really wanted what you made. [Chuckle] God, remember when you were like mixing formulas in your kitchen at 2am?

Character 1: My landlord complained about the smell.

238 Character 2: And now—now you're sold out! Like completely sold out! Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it, especially your mom.

Character 1: Haven't processed it myself yet.

239 Character 2: Okay okay, that's—that's fair. It's a lot, right? Like one day you're just... you, and then suddenly you're this person who created something everyone wants. That's gotta be kinda terrifying.

Character 1: The restock pressure's already starting.

240 Character 2: Oh god, already? Can't people just like—I dunno, let you breathe for five seconds? [Sigh] Actually wait, that's a good problem though, right? People wanting more?

Character 1: Good problem. Still a problem.

241 Character 2: You're right, you're—yeah. But like, you did this. You actually did the thing everyone said was impossible. Starting a makeup brand from nothing? That's... I mean, come on.

Character 1: Lucky, I guess.

242 Character 2: Luck? Are you—no. Nope. Lucky is finding twenty bucks on the street, okay? This was you working until 4am every night, testing everything on literally everyone we know, redoing the packaging like what—seven times? That's not luck, babe. That's you being brilliant.

Script: 7ed5f59c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about what you said to Marcus.

243 Character 2: Oh. Oh no, wait—what did I say? I mean, we were talking about a bunch of stuff and I—did I say something wrong? Because if I did, I honestly didn't mean to—

Character 1: You told him I'd love to help with his startup. I never said that.

244 Character 2: But you're so good with that tech stuff! I just assumed—I mean, you're always talking about coding and I thought—okay, yeah, I shouldn't have assumed. [nervous laugh] I was just trying to help, y'know?

Character 1: That's the problem. You're always "just trying to help."

245 Character 2: I know, I know, I do this thing where I—where I think I know what you want and then I just... run with it. God, I'm doing it again right now, aren't I? Assuming you wanna hear my explanation when maybe you just need me to shut up and listen.

Character 1: You told my mom I was dating someone.

246 Character 2: That was—okay that was really stupid. I saw you texting someone and smiling and I just—I got excited for you? And then your mom asked how you were doing and it just... came out. [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever.

Character 1: I was texting my cousin about her wedding.

247 Character 2: Oh my god. Of course you were. See this is—this is exactly what you mean, right? I just make up these whole stories in my head about your life and then I go around spreading them like they're facts. I don't even—I don't even ask you first.

Character 1: No. You don't.

248 Character 2: I think I'm being helpful or—or supportive or whatever, but I'm actually just... making your life harder. Putting you in awkward situations where you gotta explain that no, actually, your friend is just an idiot who can't keep her mouth shut.

Character 1: Do you know how exhausting it is? Constantly correcting things you've said about me?

249 Character 2: No, I—I honestly hadn't thought about it like that. [sigh] That must be so frustrating, having to do damage control all the time because I can't just... ask you stuff directly. I'm really, really sorry.

Character 1: Last week you told everyone I was thinking about law school.

250 Character 2: Because you mentioned lawyers once! Which is—yeah, no, that's insane. That's actually insane logic. I don't know why I do this, I think maybe I just get so excited about stuff for you that I don't stop to think if it's even real?

Character 1: I need you to stop deciding who I am.

251 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right. I keep—I keep filling in blanks that aren't mine to fill. Like I'm writing your story instead of letting you tell it yourself, and that's... that's really messed up actually.

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

252 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm gonna work on this. Like, really work on it. Next time I wanna say something about you to someone, I'll just... ask you first? Or better yet, keep my mouth shut entirely. You deserve a friend who actually listens to who you are, not—not someone who makes stuff up.

Script: 15cd374f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I won that pitch competition thing.

253 Character 2: Wait wait wait—WHAT? You—oh my god, you actually won? Like, THE pitch competition? The one with all those, um, those crazy investors?

Character 1: Yeah. Twenty grand and six months of mentorship.

254 Character 2: Twenty—okay I'm literally gonna scream. This is huge! Why are you being so, like, so calm about this? [Laugh] You just beat out what, like fifty other startups?

Character 1: Seventy-three.

255 Character 2: SEVENTY—okay no, that's insane. That's actually insane. How are you not, like, bouncing off the walls right now? I mean, I'm bouncing off the walls and it's not even my thing!

Character 1: I don't know. Feels weird.

256 Character 2: Weird how? Like, um, imposter syndrome weird or like—wait, are you worried about actually having to, y'know, deliver now?

Character 1: Both. Maybe. The other pitches were really good.

257 Character 2: Okay but—but yours was better, right? That's literally why you won. The judges didn't just, like, randomly pick your name out of a [Chuckle] hat or something.

Character 1: My parents haven't said anything about it yet.

258 Character 2: Oh. Oh, honey, that's—ugh, of course they haven't. But you know what? This isn't about them. This is your thing, your win, your... everything.

Character 1: Yeah, I guess.

259 Character 2: No no no, not "I guess"—you literally just secured funding for your dream! That's—do you know how many people never even get to pitch? Let alone win?

Character 1: It's a lot of pressure now though.

260 Character 2: Well yeah, but like... good pressure? The kind where people actually believe in you enough to, um, to invest actual money? That's kinda [Sigh] incredible when you think about it.

Character 1: What if I mess it up?

261 Character 2: Okay first of all—you won't. Second, even if things get messy, which they will because, hello, startup life—you've already proven you can handle it. You convinced those judges, didn't you?

Character 1: I almost threw up right before going on stage.

262 Character 2: Wait, you almost—and you still killed it? That's even more impressive! See, you're like, you're basically unstoppable when you're terrified, which is honestly the best superpower.

Script: dc95fd2f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about last night.

263 Character 2: Oh, come on—not this again. Look, I was just trying to get everyone to have a good time, okay? You're acting like I forced a bottle down your throat or something.

Character 1: You wouldn't drop it.

264 Character 2: Because you were sitting there all—I dunno, uptight? Everyone else was having fun and you were just... there. I thought maybe if you loosened up a bit you'd actually [scoff] enjoy yourself for once.

Character 1: I said no. Three times.

265 Character 2: Okay okay, but like—it's not that serious. I was being playful! You know me, that's just how I am. I didn't think you'd get all bent out of shape about it.

Character 1: "Don't be boring." "Just one shot." "Stop being such a baby." Ring any bells?

266 Character 2: That's—okay that's taken completely out of context and you know it. I was joking around! Everyone was laughing, even you kinda smiled at one point, so don't act like I was being this huge bully.

Character 1: I wasn't smiling.

267 Character 2: Fine, whatever, but you're making this into something way bigger than it needs to be. Like, honestly? [frustrated laugh] I'm a little disappointed that you think I'd actually try to hurt you or something. That's not—I'm not that person.

Character 1: You embarrassed me. In front of everyone.

268 Character 2: I didn't—look look, if I embarrassed you, that wasn't the plan, alright? But you're kinda embarrassing me right now by making me out to be this terrible friend when I was literally just trying to include you.

Character 1: Include me? By calling me names when I wouldn't drink?

269 Character 2: They weren't—ugh, they weren't mean names! It was teasing! There's a difference! And honestly, you've been so judge-y lately about everyone who drinks, so maybe I got a little defensive, okay? [sigh] But I wasn't trying to pressure you.

Character 1: Yes. You were.

270 Character 2: No, I was—I was trying to help you not feel left out! There's a difference between encouraging someone and pressuring them. You just... you always assume the worst about everything I do lately.

Character 1: Maybe because you keep doing this.

271 Character 2: Keep doing—what, trying to be your friend? Trying to make sure you're having fun? I mean, I'm sorry if my methods aren't perfect, but at least I'm trying. You just shut down and get all cold like this.

Character 1: I need you to stop.

272 Character 2: Fine. Fine, I'll—I'll back off about the drinking stuff. But just so we're clear, I still think you're overreacting, and it kinda sucks that you can't see I was coming from a good place. But whatever, message received.

Script: 9a07a90e_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You forgot the interview.

273 Character 2: What? No, that's—that's next week, isn't it? I swear I had it in my calendar for next Tuesday.

Character 1: It was today. Two hours ago.

274 Character 2: Oh god. Oh—okay, wait wait wait, let me check my—[groan] shit. I must've put it in wrong. But honestly, you could've reminded me? Like, a text or something?

Character 1: I shouldn't have to.

275 Character 2: That's not—come on, you know how crazy things have been for me lately. I'm basically drowning in work stuff, my mom's been sick, I haven't slept properly in like a week. I'm sorry I forgot, but I'm not a machine.

Character 1: This was important to me.

276 Character 2: And I get that, I do. But you're acting like I did this to spite you or something. It was a mistake—a shitty one, yeah, but still just a mistake. [frustrated laugh] I've literally been there for everything else.

Character 1: Except when it actually mattered.

277 Character 2: That's—wow, okay. So all the other times I showed up don't count now? All the times I dropped everything to help you? None of that matters because I screwed up once while my life is falling apart?

Character 1: You knew how much I needed this.

278 Character 2: Yeah, and I'm sorry! I am. But I'm also kinda pissed that you can't see I'm barely keeping my head above water here. Like, I forgot one thing—one important thing, fine—but I didn't do it on purpose.

Character 1: The result's the same.

279 Character 2: Is it though? Because intent matters, doesn't it? I mean—look, if you wanna be mad, be mad, but don't act like I'm some terrible friend who doesn't care about you. That's not fair.

Character 1: You promised you'd be there.

280 Character 2: And I meant to be! I wanted to be there, honestly. But I—I can't keep track of everything right now. [sigh] I know that's not what you wanna hear, but it's the truth.

Character 1: Right.

281 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down on me. I messed up, okay okay, I admit it. But you're not even trying to understand what I'm dealing with. It's like my stuff doesn't matter at all.

Character 1: Your stuff always matters. Mine was supposed to matter today.

282 Character 2: You're right. It was. And I—I blew it. But I dunno what you want from me here. I can't go back and fix it, and you clearly don't wanna hear that I'm sorry, so... what now?

283 SCENARIO: trying to decide if they should get gas now or later

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, I've got like a quarter tank left, which is— which is fine, right? I mean, that's, uh, that's probably enough to get to work tomorrow and maybe, um, maybe back home too?

[uncertain]

But then again, I have that thing on Thursday, the, uh— oh right, I have to drive to my mom's, and that's like, what, forty minutes? [hmm] So maybe I should just, um, maybe I should just get gas now while I'm thinking about it.

[slightly annoyed]

But the thing is, it's, like, it's rush hour right now, so the gas station's gonna be all— all crowded and stuff. And I hate waiting behind, um, behind those people who take forever to, uh, to figure out their credit card situation.

[contemplative]

On the other hand, if I wait until tomorrow morning, I'll probably be running late, and then I'll be all stressed and, um, and rushing around. [sigh] Which is, like, exactly what I don't want.

[resigned]

You know what? I'm just— I'm just gonna do it now. Get it over with. Better safe than, uh, than standing on the side of the highway, right?

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 63b6cc61 | Role: Character 1 (A)

284 Character 1: [frustrated growl] Three months! [louder] Three damn months chasing shadows and what do we have? [bitter laugh] A board full of red string leading to absolutely nothing but another corpse in the morgue.

Character 2: [quietly seething] Don't remind me. [explosive] Every lead, every witness, every piece of evidence just—vanishes! [voice cracking] Like we're chasing smoke while this psycho keeps playing games with us.

285 Character 1: [manic energy] You know what? [ripping sound] Let's start fresh! [shouting] This board is cursed anyway! Watch me tear down every useless photo, every dead-end timeline, every lying witness statement right now!

Character 2: [dark chuckle] Yes! [increasingly unhinged] Burn it all! The forensics that led nowhere, the alibis that checked out, [screaming] the security footage that mysteriously corrupted! It's all garbage!

286 Character 1: [panting heavily] Look at this! [sarcastic sing-song] "Suspect seen at 9:15 PM." [venomous] Except he was also magically across town at the same time according to twelve different cameras!

Character 2: [hollow laugh] My favorite part? [building rage] The DNA evidence that matches nobody in any database, anywhere, ever. [whispered fury] It's like our killer doesn't even exist in reality.

287 Character 1: [exhausted groan] The captain's breathing down our necks. [mockingly high-pitched] "Any progress, detectives?" [normal voice, defeated] Progress? We're moving backwards at the speed of light into complete insanity here.

Character 2: [hysterical laughter] And the victims! [more controlled] No connection whatsoever—different ages, backgrounds, locations. [punch sound] The only pattern is that there IS no pattern! How's that for investigative brilliance?

288 Character 1: [sudden realization] Wait. [slowly] What if that's exactly the point? [building excitement] What if the randomness, the impossible evidence, the contradictions—what if it's all intentional misdirection?

Character 2: [skeptical grunt] Great, so instead of incompetent, we're just [sarcastically cheerful] dancing puppets in some mastermind's show? [serious whisper] That's supposed to make me feel better about destroying six months of work?

289 Character 1: [cold determination] No, listen. [faster] Every "mistake" we found, every impossibility—they required inside knowledge. [triumphant] Someone who knows our procedures, our blind spots, our investigation methods. Someone close.

Character 2: [long pause] You're saying... [disbelief] Are you seriously suggesting this is an inside job? [nervous laugh] That someone in the department is orchestrating this whole nightmare?

290 Character 1: [grimly certain] Look at the board again. [commanding] Or what's left of it. Every breakthrough we almost had got leaked, every safe house compromised. [whispered accusation] That's not luck.

Character 2: [dawning horror] The Patterson witness. [shaky voice] She only told us her location. [stronger] Two hours later, she was dead. Nobody else knew where we stashed her.

291 Character 1: [quietly intense] And the evidence that went missing from lockup? [building anger] The security logs that got corrupted? [shouting] The autopsy reports that got "accidentally" shredded? All internal access required!

Character 2: [defeated whisper] So we've been sabotaging ourselves this whole time. [bitter laugh] Fighting with both hands tied because the enemy's been [voice breaking] sitting next to us in briefings.

292 Character 1: [energized] But they made a mistake! [rapid speech] Destroying evidence leaves traces too. [determined] Security badges, access logs, timestamp discrepancies—we just weren't looking at our own people before.

Character 2: [cautious hope] The rage room session actually helped then? [dry humor] Instead of career suicide, we just [thoughtfully] stripped away the camouflage by destroying their carefully crafted distractions?

293 Character 1: [deadly serious] We tell no one. [firm] Not the captain, not our partners, nobody. [whispered urgency] We rebuild this board in secret and this time, we hunt from within.

Character 2: [resolved exhale] Agreed. [darkly amused] Let them think we've lost it, gone crazy from dead ends. [ice cold] Meanwhile, we'll be watching everyone who's been watching us fail.

Script: 27907039 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [slurred] Listen, I'm tellin' ya, the accident happened at, uh... [confused] 4523 Maple Street—no wait, [frustrated] was it Maple or Main? [groans] My claim number is JX-778... 9... 2, I think.

294 Customer Support: Sir, I see here your claim number is actually JX-77892-B. Now, according to your form, you listed the accident date as February 31st, but that date doesn't exist?

Character 1: [defensive] February thirty-fir—yeah, that's right! [mumbles] Or maybe it was the twenty... ninth? [suddenly loud] The other guy's license plate was QRX-4... 4... something with a seven!

295 Customer Support: I understand this is difficult, Mr. Thompson. However, I need accurate information—your policy number 55A-9982-C shows you reported damages of, um, "one million dollars to the bumper"?

Character 1: [indignant] Million? No, no, I said... [trails off] a billion—wait, that's not right either. [laughs inappropriately] Maybe like twelve hundred? [quietly] My head's still ringin' from the airbag, ya know.

296 Customer Support: [sympathetic] Have you seen a doctor about that, sir? [professional] Your medical coverage under section 14-B allows for up to $15,000 in treatment, but you need proper documentation from a licensed physician.

Character 1: [excited] Oh yeah, Dr. Johnson—or was it Jackson? [sighs heavily] At 789 Medical Plaza, suite... suite... [frustrated mumbling] the one with the fish tank! He gave me these papers with all these numbers.

297 Customer Support: [slightly exasperated] Mr. Thompson, I'll need those exact medical record numbers. Also, you've listed your vehicle as a "2019 Toyota Ferrari"—could you clarify the actual make and model, please?

Character 1: [laughing] Toyota Ferrari, that's funny! [suddenly serious] It's a Corolla, definitely a Corolla. [uncertain] VIN number starts with JT2... or was it 2TJ? [groans] These forms got too many boxes, lady.

298 Customer Support: We're almost done here, sir, just a few more questions. Your witness, listed as "Bob from the gas station"—I'll need his full name and contact number for verification.

Character 1: [defensive] Bob's a good witness! [thinking hard] Robert... Robert something-Polish, works at the Shell on Highway 42. [confidently] His number's 555-01... [trails off] zero-one-something-something, definitely starts with 555 though!

299 Customer Support: [sighs quietly] Sir, regarding the other driver's insurance—you wrote their company as "All-Snake" insurance? Did you perhaps mean Allstate, policy holder Marcus Webb, account MW-4429-X?

Character 1: [triumphant] All-Snake, Allstate, same thing! [mumbled] Marcus Webb, yeah, that sounds right. [getting agitated] Look, he ran the red light at Oak and Third—[correcting himself] or was I on Third and he was on Oak?

300 Customer Support: According to police report 2024-1147-B, the incident occurred at Oak and Fifth Avenue. Does that help refresh your memory? [concerned] The responding officer was Badge 5584, Officer Martinez.

Character 1: [relieved] Fifth! That's it, Fifth Avenue! [excited rambling] I remember now, there was that Subway on the corner—no, wait, [confused again] that's a Quiznos. Officer Martinez had a mustache, real thick one!

301 Customer Support: [trying to refocus] Let's concentrate on the damages, Mr. Thompson. You're claiming $3,200 for vehicle repair, $800 for rental car fees, and, um, "$50 for emotional damage to pet rock"?

Character 1: [defensive] Mr. Pebbles was in the cupholder during impact! [earnestly] He's never been the same since. [quieter] But yeah, okay, maybe skip that one—the real total's around four grand, right?

302 Customer Support: [professionally] I'll process the legitimate claims totaling $4,000. [instructive tone] You'll receive confirmation at your email—is it still punchyboxer1981 at hotmail? Please respond to verification code XB-9902 within 48 hours.

Character 1: [worried] Forty-eight hours? [confused] That's like... two days? [suddenly remembering] Oh, and my email might be punchyboxer1982—[frustrated groan] or was it 81? Check both!

303 Customer Support: I'll send to both addresses to be safe. Your case manager will be Jennifer Park, extension 4556. [warmly] Please see a doctor about that head injury, Mr. Thompson, and have a safe day.

Script: 5ad3baf4 | Role: Customer Support

304 Customer Support: Tech support, this is Jordan speaking, how can I help you today? I see you're calling about an update issue—let me pull up your account real quick.

Character 1: [exhausted] Yeah, I've been... I've been trying to install this update for three hours now. [sighs heavily] It keeps failing at ninety-two percent, and I'm just—[defeated] I don't know what else to try anymore.

305 Customer Support: Oh, that's incredibly frustrating, I completely understand. Let's get this sorted right away—first, can you tell me, um, which version you're currently running? Should be under Settings, then About.

Character 1: [slowly] It's version... eight point four point six. [groans] Look, I've already tried restarting, clearing the cache, even—even factory reset last week. [desperately] Nothing works, and I need this for work tomorrow.

306 Customer Support: Okay, okay, we'll definitely get this fixed before then. Here's what we're gonna do—I'm seeing a known issue with that specific build that affects, uh, about twelve percent of users. There's a workaround though.

Character 1: [sarcastically] A workaround, great, because those always work perfectly. [sighs] Sorry, I'm just... [wearily] What do I need to do now?

307 Customer Support: No worries at all, I get it—technology can be maddening sometimes. So first, you'll need to boot into safe mode, then—this is important—disable the security suite temporarily. I'll walk you through each step.

Character 1: [hesitantly] Safe mode... okay, I think I remember how. [muttering] Hold the power button and... wait, no. [frustrated groan] Can you just—can you remind me?

308 Customer Support: Absolutely! Power completely off first, then hold volume down while pressing power. Keep holding until you see the logo appear twice—not once, twice—that's the tricky part most people miss.

Character 1: [concentrating] Alright, powering off now... holding volume down and... [excitedly] Oh! There's the safe mode text in the corner! [relieved chuckle] Finally, something actually worked.

309 Customer Support: Perfect! You're doing great. Now navigate to Settings, Security, and toggle off the enhanced protection—just temporarily. After that, retry the update from the beginning.

Character 1: [cautiously] Okay, security is off, starting the download again. [nervously] It's at ten percent... twenty... [increasingly hopeful] Wait, it's actually moving past where it usually freezes!

310 Customer Support: Excellent, that's exactly what should happen! While that's running, let me just document this issue for our development team—they really need to push a proper fix. This shouldn't be happening to customers.

Character 1: [amazed] Seventy percent... eighty... ninety! [gasps] It went past ninety-two! [laughing] I can't believe a simple security toggle was the problem all along.

311 Customer Support: [relieved chuckle] Sometimes it's the smallest things that cause the biggest headaches. Once it completes, you can re-enable security—the conflict only happens during installation, not after.

Character 1: [gratefully] It's installing now, says three minutes remaining. [sighs happily] You know, I was about ready to throw this thing out the window. [more sincerely] Thank you so much for your patience.

312 Customer Support: Hey, that's what we're here for! [quickly] Just remember for future updates—if you hit that same wall, try the safe mode trick first. [more casually] Saves everyone time and frustration.

Character 1: [curious] Will this bug be fixed in the next version? [hesitantly] Because I really don't want to go through this whole... this whole circus again next month.

313 Customer Support: Actually, yes—the fix is already in beta testing. Version nine point zero should roll out within two weeks, and it completely eliminates this compatibility issue. Your future updates should be smooth sailing.

Character 1: [relieved] Update complete! Everything's working perfectly now. [chuckles softly] You've been amazing, Jordan—seriously, thank you. [gratefully] I can actually sleep tonight knowing work tomorrow won't be a disaster.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

314 [Slow] So basically, I sit at a computer all day and, um, I write code that tells other computers how to—[Sigh] okay, imagine I'm teaching robots to talk to each other.

315 [Fast] No no no, it's not like CSI where I'm typing really fast and screens are flashing—[Laugh] that's just Hollywood nonsense, y'know?

316 [Happy] Oh, you've heard of spreadsheets? [Chuckle] Well, I kinda make those dance and do tricks they weren't supposed to do!

317 [Sarcastic] Yeah, I'm basically a professional email sender who occasionally does actual work. [Tsk] Super glamorous, right?

318 [Whisper] Between you and me, half the time I'm just googling how to fix things—[Fast] but don't tell my boss that.

319 [Disappointed] I thought it'd be more creative, but honestly? [Slow] Most days I'm just, er, moving numbers from one place to another place.

320 [Angry] No, I don't fix printers! [Groan] Why does everyone think—just because I work with computers doesn't mean I know why your printer's jammed!

321 [Slow] Think of it like, um, like being a translator? [Happy] Except instead of languages, I'm translating human thoughts into machine language!

322 [Sad] My parents still don't get what I do, and I've been trying to explain for—[Sigh] it's been five years now.

323 [Fast] Okay so you know when you order something online and it shows up? [Excited] I make sure all those little steps in between actually happen!

324 [Sarcastic] I attend meetings about meetings, and then we schedule follow-ups to discuss the meetings about meetings—[Disappointed] it's thrilling stuff, truly.

325 [Shout] Wait, that's actually a perfect example! [Happy] See how your phone just did that thing? I program stuff like that!

326 [Whisper] Honestly? Some days I barely understand it myself—[Chuckle] but as long as the paycheck clears, right?

327 [Slow] It's kinda like being a detective, except, um, instead of solving crimes, I'm figuring out why—[Fast] why everything broke at 3 AM last Tuesday.

328 [Disappointed] Everyone thinks it's super high-tech, but I literally spend most of my time in—[Tsk] in boring conference calls.

329 [Happy] You ever play with LEGOs as a kid? [Fast] It's basically that but with invisible pieces that sometimes explode!

330 [Angry] I don't just "play on Facebook all day"—I mean, okay, sometimes, but—[Groan] there's actual work involved, I swear!

331 [Sad] The worst part is when people's eyes glaze over and they just—[Slow] they just nod politely while I'm explaining.

332 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, I "work from home," which apparently means I'm available to accept packages for the entire neighborhood—[Laugh] because I'm obviously not doing anything important.

333 [Whisper] Want to know a secret? [Fast] Most of what I do could probably be automated, but, uh, let's keep that between us, yeah?

334 SCENARIO: Excited about a new relationship, then insecure about a text, then gets a reassuring reply

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my god, okay, so you know how I was telling you about Jake? We had our third date last night and it was just— [sigh] it was perfect. Like actually perfect. We went to that little wine bar downtown and we just talked for like three hours straight, and it didn't feel forced or weird or anything.

[giddy]

And then he walked me home and we kissed goodnight and it was just, uh, it was really sweet. Like he didn't try to come up or anything, he was just— he was really respectful about it. And then this morning he texted me saying he had an amazing time.

[slightly anxious]

But then I texted him back like two hours ago and he hasn't— he hasn't responded yet. Which is probably nothing, right? Like he's probably just at work or whatever, but I keep checking my phone and I'm like... am I being clingy? Did I say something weird?

[uncertain]

I just said "me too, can't wait to see you again" with like a smiley face, which seems normal but now I'm second-guessing the smiley face because maybe that's too— 

[surprised]

Oh wait, he's texting me right now! Hold on, let me just—

[relieved] [warm]

Oh. [small laugh] Okay he says "sorry babe, crazy morning at work. Dinner Friday? I'm already missing you." 

God, I'm such an overthinker. [chuckle] He called me babe though. That's... that's new.
