Character 1: We need to talk about last night.

621 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know I was kinda loud at dinner. Was I too loud? I was probably too loud. Sometimes I just get excited and I don't realize how much I'm—y'know, taking over the conversation.

Character 1: It's not just last night.

622 Character 2: Wait wait wait, what do you mean? Like, other times too? I mean—okay, I guess I do talk a lot sometimes but I thought everyone was having fun? [nervous laugh] Were people not having fun?

Character 1: It was supposed to be Jamie's birthday dinner.

623 Character 2: I know! I know it was, and I—oh my god, did I make it about me? I didn't mean to make it about me. I was just trying to keep things lively and then that story about my promotion kinda just—it just came out.

Character 1: For twenty minutes.

624 Character 2: Twenty min—was it really that long? Shit. Shit, I'm so sorry. I honestly didn't realize I was doing it again. It's like—I dunno, I get nervous when there's silence and then I just start filling it with whatever comes to mind.

Character 1: You do this every time we go out.

625 Character 2: That's—[sigh] that's fair. That's totally fair. I can see how that would be really frustrating. Like, really really frustrating. I'm not trying to be the center of attention, I swear, it just sorta... happens?

Character 1: Maybe think about other people for once.

626 Character 2: Okay, ouch. But—no, you're right. You're absolutely right. I've been a terrible friend, haven't I? God, I must've ruined so many nights out and nobody ever said anything and now I feel like such an ass.

Character 1: You're not a terrible friend. Just... exhausting sometimes.

627 Character 2: I get that. I really do. My therapist actually—sorry, see? I'm doing it right now, making it about me again. I'm gonna work on this, okay? Like genuinely work on it. Maybe I should just... talk less? Is that what you need from me?

Character 1: I don't want you to stop being you. Just share the spotlight occasionally.

628 Character 2: Yeah, no no no, that makes sense. That's—that's totally reasonable. I can do that. I will do that. [groan] Jamie probably hates me now, don't they? I basically hijacked their entire birthday dinner with my stupid work drama.

Character 1: They don't hate you. But you should probably apologize.

629 Character 2: Oh I'm gonna. I'm gonna text them right now—actually, no, that's better in person, right? I'll take them to lunch or something. Their choice of restaurant, and I promise I'll literally just—I'll just listen. I can listen. I'm capable of listening.

Character 1: That would be good. And maybe next time, try counting to three before jumping into conversations.

630 Character 2: Count to three. I can do that. I mean, it sounds simple but honestly that's—that's actually really good advice. Thank you for telling me this stuff. I know it wasn't easy and I'm just... I'm really sorry I've been so oblivious about it.

Script: 0e6358e9_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Really funny what you said about my teeth in front of everyone.

631 Character 2: Oh come on, it was just—we joke about stuff like that all the time. You literally made fun of my hairline last week and I didn't get all weird about it.

Character 1: That's different.

632 Character 2: How? How is that different? Because—okay, no, seriously, explain to me how that's different. We've been roasting each other for like three years and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

Character 1: You know how long it took me to stop covering my mouth when I smiled.

633 Character 2: I—shit. [sigh] Okay, I didn't think about it like that, but also you never told me it was that serious. Like, I'm supposed to just magically know where the line is?

Character 1: I thought you knew me better than that.

634 Character 2: That's not—that's not fair. I do know you, which is why I thought we were past all the, y'know, the walking on eggshells thing. I thought we could just be ourselves.

Character 1: Being yourself means humiliating me?

635 Character 2: Humiliating? Come on, that's—you're being dramatic. It was one joke, and honestly, everyone laughed because they thought we were doing our usual thing, not because they were actually [frustrated laugh] judging your teeth or whatever.

Character 1: Sure.

636 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down on me. Look look, I'm sorry it hurt you, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I'm some—some bully when we literally do this all the time.

Character 1: We don't do THIS.

637 Character 2: We kinda do though? Like, remember when you told everyone about my thing with crying during Pixar movies? That was—that was actually embarrassing, but I got over it because that's what friends do.

Character 1: That's not an insecurity. That's just a quirk.

638 Character 2: To you maybe. But I—whatever, fine fine, I get it. Your thing is different, more important, more whatever. But you gotta understand I wasn't trying to hurt you. I just thought we were close enough that nothing was off limits.

Character 1: Apparently we're not that close.

639 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So three years of friendship and one bad joke means we're not close? That's—[scoff] you know what, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't know you as well as I thought.

Character 1: Glad we're finally being honest.

640 Character 2: Yeah, me too. Because honestly? I'm disappointed that instead of just telling me I crossed a line, you're gonna blow up our whole friendship over something I didn't even—something I would've apologized for if you'd just talked to me like an actual friend.

641 SCENARIO: waiting in a long checkout line that isn't moving

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, this line is definitely not— it's not moving at all. Like, at all. I've been standing here for, what, like five minutes? And we haven't— we haven't moved even one person forward.

[slightly incredulous] 

What is even— what's even happening up there? I can't see, um, I can't see what the holdup is, but there's gotta be something. Maybe it's like a price check or, uh, or someone's trying to use expired coupons or— [sigh] I don't know.

[resigned]

I mean, I could switch lines, but then— but then that's always when this one starts moving again, right? That's like, um, that's like a universal law or something. The second you switch, your old line becomes the fast one.

[contemplative]

Although, honestly, that lady over there looks like she's— she's moving pretty good. Her line's definitely— wait, no, she just stopped too. [tsk] Never mind.

[flat]

Okay, so I guess we're all just, um, we're all just standing here now. Living our best grocery store life. This is fine. This is, uh, this is totally how I wanted to spend my Saturday.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 7981c0b2 | Role: Character 1 (A)

642 Character 1: [bitter laugh] See this beauty across my ribs? [tracing motion] Six inches of Damascus steel, courtesy of our handler's "miscalculated extraction." [darkly amused] They sent me in blind, then forgot to mention the guards had night vision.

Character 2: [low chuckle] Amateur hour. [in a gravelly tone] Mine's from Prague—third-degree burns down my shoulder blade. [Sharp exhale] Our beloved agency decided napalm was easier than sending backup when my cover got blown.

643 Character 1: [sarcastically sweet] How thoughtful of them. [Hollow laugh] Remember Marseille? [voice dropping] They injected me with expired truth serum, left me seizing for hours before realizing their mistake.

Character 2: [incredulous] Expired? [more bitterly] At least yours was accidental. [Dry cough] Cairo, twenty-eighteen—they deliberately broke my kneecap during "enhanced interrogation training" to make my limp look authentic.

644 Character 1: [whistling exhale] Jesus. [quieter] Though I suppose my missing molar has character now. [building anger] They yanked it out with pliers because the cyanide capsule "needed to look realistic" for the Mumbai job.

Character 2: [matching anger] The Mumbai clusterfuck! [Bitter snort] That's when they carved this lovely souvenir into my back. [venomously] Twenty-seven stitches, no anesthetic—said it would "build character" for deep cover work.

645 Character 1: [mock cheerful] Building character, their favorite excuse. [Harsh whisper] Notice how I can't fully close my left eye? [louder] Nerve damage from their experimental combat drug that was "definitely tested and safe."

Character 2: [cynical amusement] Safe like their bulletproof vests in Tehran? [voice cracking] This punctured lung says otherwise. [Wheezing laugh] Three bullets went straight through their "state-of-the-art protection."

646 Character 1: [exhausted tone] Sometimes I count them at night. [more quietly] Seventeen scars, nine fractures, four concussions. [Dark chuckle] My medical file reads like a horror novel ghost-written by bureaucrats.

Character 2: [contemplative] Twenty-three scars here. [Slow exhale] Lost count of the fractures after Siberia. [grimly amused] You know what's fucked? We're still here, still taking their calls, still saying yes.

647 Character 1: [philosophical] Stockholm syndrome with dental benefits and a pension. [rueful laugh] Although the pension assumes we live long enough. [trailing off] What's the current life expectancy for our department—thirty-eight?

Character 2: [correcting] Thirty-six, actually. [Gallows humor] Henderson updated the actuarial tables last month. [snickering] Apparently, our new missions have "increased risk factors"—as if the old ones were vacation packages.

648 Character 1: [suddenly bright] Speaking of vacation, remember Bali? [voice hardening] When they used me as bait without telling me? [Sarcastic laugh] Nothing says "trust your agency" like discovering you're the honeypot mid-operation.

Character 2: [sympathetic grunt] That was dirty, even for them. [more intensely] Though not as dirty as injecting us with those tracking chips. [disgusted] "For our safety," they said, while monitoring our every bowel movement.

649 Character 1: [weary] The chips were almost quaint compared to the psychological conditioning. [Shaky breath] Six months of controlled trauma to "optimize performance." [flatly] I still can't hear Beethoven without vomiting.

Character 2: [understanding] Pavlov would be so proud. [Harsh cackle] They played Vivaldi during my sessions. [lower voice] Sometimes I wake up thinking I'm back in that white room with the speakers.

650 Character 1: [nostalgic poison] Remember when we thought this job would be glamorous? [building frustration] Martinis and tuxedos, not blood tests and burn units. [Hysterical giggle] God, we were such beautiful idiots back then.

Character 2: [wistful] Beautiful and intact. [Short laugh] Now look at us—walking classified documents written in scar tissue. [proudly bitter] At least we're too valuable to kill off completely, right?

651 Character 1: [deadpan] Too valuable or too expensive to replace? [Tired sigh] Training new recruits costs more than keeping us barely functional. [sardonically] We're like vintage cars—cheaper to repair than buy new.

Character 2: [raising glass gesture] Here's to being vintage. [Dark toast] May our scars multiply slower than our enemies. [final laugh] And may the agency's medical budget outlive us both—shouldn't be too difficult.

Script: 18dcda8c | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Hi, um, I'm calling about my SmartTemp 3000—the thing's gone completely haywire. [frustrated] It keeps setting itself to 82 degrees at, like, 3 AM every night, and my bedroom feels like [groans] a sauna.

652 Customer Support: [professionally] Good afternoon, I'd be happy to help you with your SmartTemp device. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account—could you provide your serial number? [more clearly] It should be on the back panel, starting with ST3.

Character 1: [rustling sounds] Oh, yeah, hold on... it's ST3-4789-XK2M. [exasperated] I've tried everything—resetting it, unplugging it for thirty seconds, even [chuckles nervously] yelling at it, which obviously didn't work.

653 Customer Support: Perfect, I see your device here, registered to 1847 Maple Drive. Now, when you say 82 degrees—is this happening, um, consistently at 3 AM? Have you recently updated the firmware or changed any scheduling settings?

Character 1: [defensively] No, no, I haven't touched anything since installation in, what was it, February? [sighs] The installer, Joe or John maybe, he set it all up perfectly. [more urgently] But last Tuesday it just started this weird midnight heat wave routine.

654 Customer Support: Interesting, so this started specifically on October 15th. Let me check something—are you by chance enrolled in our EcoSmart energy program? Sometimes utility companies can remotely adjust temperatures during their, uh, peak management periods.

Character 1: [surprised] EcoSmart? I mean, maybe? [uncertain] There was this form I filled out for a $50 rebate... [groans loudly] Wait, are you telling me the power company is literally cooking me alive at night for fifty bucks?

655 Customer Support: Well, not exactly cooking you, but yes, they can make adjustments. The good news is we can easily opt you out—just need to verify your account PIN. That's the four-digit code you created during registration.

Character 1: [thinking aloud] Four digits... oh geez, um, probably 2-4-6-8? [frustrated sigh] No wait, that's my garage code. [more confidently] It's 1979, my birth year—yeah, definitely 1979, unless my wife changed it.

656 Customer Support: Perfect, that worked! I've successfully removed you from the EcoSmart program. Your thermostat should now follow only your personal schedule. Is there anything else I can help you with today, maybe setting up a custom comfort schedule?

657 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Riverside Events, this is Claire speaking. How can I help you with your upcoming event today?

Character 1: [stressed] Oh thank god someone picked up—I'm getting married in three weeks and I just heard about some new restrictions? [panicked] My planner is on vacation and I'm, I'm completely drowning here.

658 Customer Support: Okay, let's take this step by step. Which date is your event and, um, what specific restrictions are you concerned about?

Character 1: [rapidly] March fifteenth, and apparently there's something about capacity limits and—wait, no—noise ordinances? [groans] I have two hundred guests confirmed already!

659 Customer Support: [calmly] Right, so for March fifteenth, we're actually at full capacity allowance now. [more cheerfully] The noise ordinance only affects outdoor spaces after ten PM, which shouldn't impact your ballroom reservation.

Character 1: [relieved sigh] Outdoor spaces... but we booked the terrace for cocktails. [worried] Does this mean the band can't play out there?

660 Customer Support: The band is fine until ten, but honestly, most couples move entertainment inside by eight anyway. We can absolutely coordinate that transition for you.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] And what about the catering? [frantically] Someone mentioned kitchen restrictions and I've already paid the deposit for the seven-course menu we selected.

661 Customer Support: No changes to catering whatsoever—that's probably old information floating around. Your seven-course menu is locked in and the kitchen is fully operational.

Character 1: [exhales deeply] Okay, okay, that's better. [hesitantly] But I keep hearing about parking issues from other brides?

662 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Yeah, the city's doing construction on the north lot, which—I won't lie—reduces our spaces by about forty. But we're offering free valet service for all March events.

Character 1: [surprised] Free valet? [more relaxed] That's actually better than what we planned. Will they handle elderly guests okay?

663 Customer Support: Absolutely, our valet team is trained for accessibility needs. They'll have golf carts ready for anyone who needs assistance from the parking area.

Character 1: [sighs with relief] This is so much better than I expected. [sheepishly] I think I've been reading too many horror stories online about venue disasters.

664 Customer Support: Trust me, you're not the first bride to call in a panic. We've handled over two hundred events this year without any major hiccups.

Character 1: [gratefully] You've really calmed my nerves, Claire. [curiously] Should I, um, should I forward all this information to my planner when she's back?

665 Customer Support: I'll email you everything we discussed, plus our updated guidelines document. That way you both have it in writing—less stress for everyone.

Character 1: [brightening] Perfect, yes, that would be amazing. [quickly] Oh wait—one more thing about photography restrictions?

666 Customer Support: No restrictions on photography or videography anywhere on the property. [more slowly] Just have them check in at the front desk for their vendor passes.

Character 1: [relieved laugh] Claire, you're a lifesaver—literally. [warmly] I can actually breathe again, thank you so much for your patience with all my questions!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

667 [Fast] Okay so, um, that was—that wasn't supposed to happen like that, obviously. [Nervous laugh] [Sigh] Just gonna pretend the last five minutes didn't exist.

668 [Whisper] Is everyone still looking at me or can I, like, come out from behind this plant now? [Tsk]

669 [Sarcastic] Well, that went great. [Slow] Really nailed it. [Groan]

670 [Happy] You know what? [Laugh] At least I'll have a funny story for later, right?

671 [Angry] I specifically practiced so this wouldn't—ugh, whatever. [Fast] Let's just move on, please.

672 [Sad] I kinda wanna disappear into the floor right now, if that's, um, if that's possible. [Sigh]

673 [Shout] IT'S FINE! [Fast] [Nervous laugh] Everything's fine, I'm fine, we're all fine here!

674 [Disappointed] I had one job—literally one job—and I managed to mess it up. [Tsk] [Slow] Classic me, honestly.

675 [Whisper] [Fast] Did my face just turn red? It feels red. Oh god, it's definitely red.

676 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's all just stand here in silence and really, y'know, savor this moment. [Groan]

677 [Happy] Actually, that could've gone way worse—I mean, remember when Steve did that thing with the—yeah. [Chuckle]

678 [Fast] Can we just, like, rewind and I'll try that again without the whole—without doing whatever that was? [Sigh] [Disappointed] No?

679 [Angry] [Shout] NOBODY SAW THAT! [Fast] And if you did, you're gonna forget it immediately, got it?

680 [Slow] So, um, moving forward, we're never gonna talk about this again, right? [Whisper] Please say right.

681 [Sad] [Slow] I practiced this a hundred times and then my brain just... went completely blank. [Tsk]

682 [Chuckle] Well, at least I didn't, uh—actually no, that was pretty much the worst thing I could've done. [Groan]

683 [Fast] [Happy] Hey, remember that time you fell off the stage? This is nothing compared to—okay, not helping? [Nervous laugh]

684 [Disappointed] Twenty years from now I'm still gonna randomly remember this at 3 AM and just—ugh. [Sigh] [Slow] Why am I like this?

685 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh good, my mom's filming this, so we can relive it forever and ever. [Tsk] Fantastic.

686 [Whisper] I'm just gonna, um, go to the bathroom for like—I dunno, maybe three hours? [Slow] [Sad] That seems reasonable.

687 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a long wait at the doctor, then the doctor spends extra time really listening

==================================================

[irritated]

Oh my god, don't even get me started on my doctor's appointment today. I got there at like 2:30 for a 2:45, right? And then I'm just sitting there, and sitting there, and it's like— it's 3:30, then 4:00, and I'm like are you kidding me right now?

[annoyed]

Like I had to leave work early for this, and I'm just staring at these ancient magazines thinking about all the stuff piling up on my desk. And the receptionist keeps being like "oh he's running a little behind" and I'm like yeah, no kidding.

[frustrated] [slightly sarcastic]

So finally, FINALLY they call me back at like 4:15, and I'm already in this mood where I'm like let's just get this over with, you know? I'm expecting the usual five-minute thing where he barely looks up from his computer.

[surprised] [softening]

But then... wait, he actually— he sat down and started asking me real questions. Like not just "how are you feeling" but actually listening to my answers and, and asking follow-ups.

[warm] [slightly amazed]

And I'm realizing as I'm talking to you that I actually told him stuff I've never mentioned before, like about my sleep and stress and— [small laugh] God, I feel kind of bad for being so pissy in the waiting room now. He was probably taking extra time with someone else who really needed it.
