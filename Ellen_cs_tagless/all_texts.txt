1 Wait wait wait—what? You got it? Oh my god, are you—are you serious right now? The one at the, um, the tech place with the fancy office?
2 An hour ago and you're just now—okay okay, I'm not even mad because like, holy shit! This is huge! When do you start? What's the salary like? Tell me everything!
3 Monday? That's—that's so soon! [Laugh] Oh my god, I'm literally getting secondhand nervous for you. But like, good nervous, y'know? The kind where you're gonna absolutely crush it.
4 No no no, stop—don't do that thing where you like, talk yourself out of good things. You've wanted this for months, right? Actually wait, is this about leaving your current place?
5 Okay but—I mean, yeah, but they also haven't promoted you in what, three years? And this new place is basically offering you everything you've been asking for, so...
6 That's just—ugh, that's so normal though. Like, everyone feels weird about big changes. Remember when I left my last job? I literally [Groan] cried in the bathroom on my last day. Over a job I hated!
7 Okay first of all, that coffee was genuinely—it was really good coffee. But also like, you're deflecting! This is your moment, babe. You should be, I dunno, celebrating or something?
8 This is you—oh my god, you're impossible. We're gonna, we're getting drinks tonight. Non-negotiable. And you're gonna tell me about the benefits package because I'm nosy like that.
9 Yes yes, obviously somewhere quiet because you're gonna wanna actually hear me when I tell you how proud I am. Like, genuinely? You've been working toward this for so long and it's just—[Sigh] it's really cool to see.
10 "Pretty happy"—okay that's like, that's basically you screaming with joy, so I'll take it. But seriously though, this is gonna be so good for you. I can feel it, y'know?
11 Oh my god—wait, and? Are they—I mean, you wouldn't just drop that on me without... okay okay, tell me everything.
12 Are you—are you serious? Like completely clear? [Gasp] Oh my god, I'm literally gonna cry. This is—this is incredible!
13 Six months! That's—okay that's huge, that's actually huge. How are you even, like, how are you feeling right now? Because I'm kinda freaking out and it's not even my results, y'know?
14 No no no, that's—that's totally normal. Like when you've been waiting and waiting and then suddenly... I mean, it's a lot to process, right?
15 Stop it—she smiled? The one who's always like, super serious? [Laugh] That's when you know it's really, really good news. God, I'm so relieved.
16 Of course she—oh honey, of course she did. She's been so worried about you. We all have been, honestly. But like, trying not to show it because we didn't wanna stress you out more.
17 Have you told anyone else yet? Wait—am I the first? Because if I'm the first person you told, I'm gonna lose it. [Chuckle] Like actually.
18 Okay that's—that's fair. Obviously mom comes first. But like, what happens now? Do you still have to do check-ups or is it just... done?
19 Right, right, so it's like—it's gradual. But that's good! That means they're confident, y'know? They wouldn't space them out if they weren't sure you're okay.
20 Don't—don't even joke about that. [Sigh] You're gonna make thirty and forty and like, all of them. We're gonna be old and wrinkly together, okay? That's the plan.
21 Oh god, oh god—I can explain! I didn't think—okay that sounds bad. But everyone was sharing their throwback pics and I just got caught up in the moment, y'know?
22 I know, I know, I'm so sorry. It was just supposed to be funny, like—remember when we were thirteen and had those matching outfits? I wasn't trying to embarrass you, I swear.
23 You're right. You're absolutely right and I—[groan] I'm such an idiot. I got all excited and just posted without thinking and that's not—that's no excuse. I should've asked first.
24 Wait, what? Oh no no no, I didn't—I had no idea! Can I—lemme delete them right now. Actually I think I already did? Hold on, I'm checking... yeah, they're gone. Deleted like an hour ago when I realized—
25 I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? Like literally the worst. I just—I was so caught up in the nostalgia and everyone was laughing and commenting and I didn't stop to think about—[nervous laugh] God, I really messed up.
26 Please don't hate me forever? I mean, I'd understand if you did but—I'm gonna make this right somehow. Whatever you need me to do. Post an apology? Tell everyone I edited them? I dunno, anything.
27 I know. But maybe I can—okay, what if I post those photos of me from camp? The ones where I'm crying because of the spider? Y'know, even the playing field a bit?
28 Right, right, of course it's not. The point is I violated your trust and I—I shared something personal without permission. [sigh] I keep doing this, don't I? Acting without thinking about how it affects you.
29 I really am sorry though. Like, genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. Not just 'sorry I got caught' but actually sorry I hurt you and—and broke your trust. That's gonna haunt me for a while.
30 Next time, absolutely. I promise. Actually, y'know what? I'm gonna ask before I post anything with you in it ever again. Even if it's just like, your hand in the background or something. I mean it.
31 I—okay, I know how this looks, but it's not like I was keeping it from you on purpose. Things have been so up in the air, I didn't even know for sure until like last week.
32 Don't do that. Don't—look, my job offer kept getting delayed and then my lease situation was a mess and I literally didn't wanna tell you something that might not even happen. [Sigh] That's not me being shady, that's me trying not to freak you out over nothing.
33 Everyone else doesn't—who told you that? Like two people know, maybe three, and that's only because they asked me directly when they saw the boxes. I wasn't gonna lie about it.
34 I didn't lie, I just—okay okay, fine, I didn't tell you, but that's different. You're acting like I wanted to hurt you when honestly? I was trying to figure out how to tell you without it being this whole thing. [frustrated laugh] Guess that worked out great.
35 No—that's not—I've been thinking about it for three months, there's a difference. The actual decision wasn't made until recently, I swear. And I mean, you've been so busy lately, when was I supposed to bring it up? "Hey, between your work drama and everything else, I might be moving"?
36 Come on, that's—you know that's not how real life works. I needed to know it was real first. And honestly? Part of me kinda hoped it wouldn't happen so I wouldn't have to—whatever, you obviously don't wanna hear this.
37 End of the month. Look look, I know that seems soon, but the timeline just got compressed and—I was gonna tell you this weekend, I swear. I had this whole plan to take you to that place we like and explain everything properly.
38 Okay, you can be mad, that's fair, but don't—[scoff] don't act like I don't care about you or this friendship. I'm literally sick about this whole thing. You think I want to leave? You think this is easy for me?
39 That's—wow. Okay. So thirteen years of friendship and one admittedly crappy situation where I didn't handle things perfectly, and suddenly you don't know me? That's really what we're doing here?
40 I'm saying something now! I'm trying to—God, I know I messed up the timing, alright? I know that. But I'm also going through something huge and scary and instead of—instead of being there for me at all, you're just making me feel worse about something that already sucks. So thanks for that, I guess.
41 [controlling tone] You're cutting those carrots wrong, dear. [Sharp exhale] Here, let me show you the proper way—my son always loved them julienned, [increasingly patronizing] not these chunky pieces you're making.
42 [dismissive laugh] Cookbooks! [louder] My mother taught me everything by hand, no books needed. [nostalgically] Real cooking comes from the heart, from tradition, from watching and learning—not reading instructions like assembling furniture.
43 [sweetly venomous] Oh, sweetheart, men never complain to their wives about food. [Soft tsk] They just quietly miss their mother's cooking. [whispered] Haven't you noticed how excited he gets when I bring dinner over?
44 [incredulous] Burning? [Scoff] I set the timer myself, there's still twelve minutes. [lecturing tone] You can't rush good food, dear. Patience is what separates mediocre cooks from exceptional ones, you know.
45 [offended gasp] My age? [Indignant] I'll have you know I cooked Thanksgiving dinner for twenty people last year, all by myself! [triumphantly] Standing for eight hours straight without a single complaint or burnt dish!
46 [suspicious] Hovering? [Hurt tone] I'm trying to help you learn, to pass down family recipes. [getting emotional] These are traditions that have been in our family for generations, precious memories in every ingredient!
47 [wounded] Competition? [voice breaking] Is that what you think this is? [Bitter laugh] I'm just trying to ensure my grandchildren grow up knowing their heritage, their family's flavors, not just whatever's trending online!
48 [cold silence] Fine. [Clipped words] Do it your way then. [dramatically resigned] I'll just stand here quietly and watch you massacre that beautiful roast with your "rough cuts" and modern techniques.
49 [frantically] Wait, use the mitt on the left! [Gasping] Not that one—it has a hole! [exasperated groan] See, this is why I need to supervise. You almost burned yourself right there!
50 [righteously] Someone needs to watch out for you, clearly. [Sniff] My son works so hard, the least you could do is learn proper kitchen safety. [pointed pause] A good wife protects her hands for her family.
51 [cheerfully] Thank you for contacting RoboVac support! [sympathetic tone] I see your device serial number RV3X-889214 in our system. [reassuringly] This mapping confusion happens sometimes when—well—reflective surfaces like mirrors interfere with the sensors.
52 [apologetically] Oh dear, that's quite the discrepancy. [in a professional tone] Could you please check if firmware version 4.2.1 is installed? [helpfully] You'll find it under Settings, then About, then scroll down to—actually, there should be eight digits there.
53 [slightly nervous] Ah, the beta version, yes. [quickly] That shouldn't have been pushed to consumer units. [more calmly] Let me escalate this to ticket number TK-20241108-5543, and we'll need to roll back your firmware immediately.
54 [concerned] That's... highly unusual. [thoughtfully] The GPS module might be experiencing interference. [more firmly] Please power cycle the unit by holding the home button for exactly 15 seconds, not 14, not 16.
55 [sympathetically] I'm terribly sorry about this experience. [decisively] I'm authorizing a replacement unit, reference code RPL-99087-DELTA. [warmly] Your new RoboVac should arrive within 3-5 business days to your registered address.
56 [apologetically] Oh wow, 52 degrees is definitely not okay. [quickly] I'll need to check our maintenance log real quick—um, what's your apartment number? [more firmly] We'll get someone up there today.
57 [defensive] I don't see any record of—wait, [suddenly concerned] here it is. [briskly] Look, the boiler's been acting up, but our tech should've already... let me make some calls right now.
58 [reassuring] I hear you, I really do. [speaking faster] The repair crew's actually on-site today—they're in building C right now. [more confidently] I'll redirect them to your unit within the hour.
59 [professionally] I'm texting you a work order confirmation right... now. [quickly] Should be hitting your phone any second. [more apologetically] And hey, I'll personally follow up if they're not there by noon.
60 [urgently] No need for that—seriously! [speaking rapidly] I'm literally walking to building B myself right now to check. [reassuringly] You have my direct number, right? Text me if they're even five minutes late.
61 [breathlessly] Already in your lobby—took the stairs. [quickly] The tech's van just pulled up outside too. [chuckles] Told you I'd handle this personally today.
62 [understanding] Hey, three days without heat in December? [warmly] I'd be furious too. [briskly] The tech should knock any second—tall guy, name's Marcus.
63 [confidently] Marcus is our best—he'll sort it out. [quickly] He's replacing the valve, not just patching it. [more casually] Should have heat within twenty minutes, thirty tops.
64 [firmly] Already scheduled monthly boiler maintenance going forward. [speaking rapidly] Plus, I'm putting your unit on priority status in our system. [reassuringly] Next time—if there is one—we respond immediately.
65 [pleased] That's what I like to hear! [briskly] I'll check back tomorrow morning just to be sure. [warmly] Stay warm, and again, really sorry about the wait.
66 [Sad] I don't—I don't understand, you said the tests were just routine, right? [Slow] This can't be happening.
67 [Angry] No, no, you've gotta be looking at someone else's results because I feel completely fine! [Fast] Check again!
68 [Whisper] Um, should I... should I call my wife now or wait until I get home? [Sigh]
69 [Disappointed] [Slow] So all those years of eating kale and running marathons were just—what, pointless?
70 [Happy] Wait, you're joking, right? [Laugh] This is like one of those hidden camera things my kids watch!
71 [Fast] Okay so how long do I have to—actually, don't answer that yet, I need a minute. [Groan]
72 [Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect timing, really, 'cause I just booked a non-refundable cruise. [Tsk]
73 [Sad] My mom went through this same thing and she, um... [Whisper] she didn't make it.
74 [Shout] I want a second opinion! [Angry] I want three opinions, actually!
75 [Slow] Can you just, like, explain it again but use smaller words this time? [Disappointed] I'm kinda lost here.
76 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Sarcastic] I literally just paid off my student loans yesterday—thirty years of payments.
77 [Fast] [Whisper] Is this the kind of thing where I gotta quit my job or can I still work?
78 [Sad] I promised my daughter I'd walk her down the aisle and she's not even engaged yet. [Sigh]
79 [Angry] This is—no, I'm gonna sue somebody, the insurance company or whoever missed this! [Groan]
80 [Happy] Honestly? [Chuckle] Part of me is relieved 'cause at least now I know why I've been feeling so weird.
81 [Slow] [Disappointed] So basically you're telling me Christmas might be... different this year, huh?
82 [Whisper] I haven't even told my kids about the divorce yet and now there's—God, this is too much. [Tsk]
83 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, sure, let's just pile it all on at once, why not throw in a meteor strike while we're at it?
84 [Sad] But Doctor, I just turned thirty, I mean, this isn't supposed to happen to people like—to people my age. [Slow]
85 [Shout] Don't touch me! [Angry] [Fast] I need to get out of here, I can't breathe in this stupid little room!
86 Wait wait wait—what? The gallery thing? The one you were like, totally convinced you had no shot at? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
87 I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is the same place that had that whole retrospective last year, right? The one we went to and you were all—[Gasp] oh my god, which piece did they take?
88 The hands one? That's—that's perfect actually. I mean, obviously they'd pick that one, it's like... haunting? But also kinda beautiful? I dunno how you do that.
89 No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you minimize it. This is literally what you've been working towards for like, what, three years? Four? You gotta let yourself feel good about this.
90 Okay but like—even if they do, which they won't, but even if they did... you're in a gallery show. That's—[Chuckle] sorry but that's more than most people ever get, y'know?
91 Two weeks? Oh god, okay, we need to—do you have something to wear? Actually wait, more importantly, are you gonna invite your parents? Because I remember last time you were all weird about—
92 Right, yeah, that's—that's fair. I mean, it's complicated with them and the whole art thing. But um, just so you know? I'm definitely coming. Like, try and stop me.
93 Are you kidding? My best friend's gonna have their art in an actual gallery with like, those little cards with your name on them and everything. I'm gonna be insufferable about it, honestly. [Laugh]
94 Oh please, you love it. But seriously though—how are you actually feeling? Because I know you, and you're probably like, freaking out internally while acting all cool about it.
95 Yeah, I—I totally get that. But it is real, okay? You did this. And I'm just... I'm really, really proud of you. Even if you're gonna be all weird about me saying that.
96 I know, I know—look, before you say anything else, I had a really bad panic attack, okay? Like, I literally couldn't breathe, couldn't leave my apartment. It wasn't about you or your party.
97 I was—I mean, I was kinda busy trying not to die? That's not fair. You're acting like I just decided to blow you off for fun when I was literally [sharp exhale] on my bathroom floor.
98 And I'm sorry about that, I am, but like—what do you want me to say? That I should've just powered through it? Come on. You know that's not how panic attacks work.
99 Okay, that's—wow. That's really shitty actually. I get that you're mad but you're being kinda cruel right now. I didn't choose this.
100 Because I knew you'd react like—like this! You're proving my point. I'm trying to explain what happened and you're just... [scoff] you're not even listening.
101 No, you're not, you're—you're waiting for me to apologize more. And fine, fine, I'm sorry I missed your party, but I'm not gonna apologize for having a mental health crisis.
102 Are you seriously—okay, you know what? Fuck this. I thought you'd at least try to understand, but you're too busy being hurt to give a shit about what I went through.
103 I know that! I know, okay? And I wanted to be there, I really really did. But my brain didn't—it just didn't cooperate. That doesn't mean I don't care about you.
104 Well that's—that's on you then. Because I've shown up for you a hundred times before this. One time, one time I couldn't make it, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever?
105 Yeah well [frustrated laugh] join the club I guess. I'm pretty disappointed too—in both of us. This isn't—this isn't who we're supposed to be to each other, y'know?
106 [cheerfully] Sweetie, I've reorganized your entire apartment while you were at work! [getting faster] I color-coded your closet, meal-prepped for two weeks, and [giggling] even scheduled your dentist appointment for tomorrow at nine.
107 [wounded] But darling, I was just trying to help! [quivering] The place was such a mess, and you never answer my calls anymore. [Soft sob] I worry about you constantly since you moved out.
108 [frantically] Fifteen times isn't that much when you think about it! [defensive] Your father thinks I'm being perfectly reasonable. [pleading whisper] Can't a mother just check if her baby ate breakfast and took vitamins?
109 [accusingly] Well, someone has to remember when you were sweet! [bitter laugh] Now you act like I'm some kind of burden. [dramatically] I gave up everything for you, my entire career, my whole identity!
110 [sarcastically] Oh, wonderful advice from someone who can't even fold fitted sheets properly! [getting louder] You still need me, whether you admit it or not. [Nervous giggle] Who else would notice you're dating that terrible person?
111 [hysterically] A break? From your own mother? [Choking sob] This is exactly what happened with cousin Janet and look how that turned out! [whimpering] She died alone, probably calling for her ungrateful children!
112 [desperately] But what if there's an emergency and I can't reach you immediately? [rapid words] What if you choke on dinner, or slip in the shower, or [Gasp] get kidnapped by internet people?
113 [offended whisper] You think I'm crazy now? [building volume] First I'm a stalker, now I need therapy? [Bitter chuckle] Maybe I should just pretend you don't exist like those modern parents do!
114 [quietly] You and your father have been discussing me behind my back? [hurt] I suppose everyone thinks poor Mom is just pathetic now. [Shaky breath] Fine, maybe I have been a tiny bit overwhelming.
115 [reluctantly] I suppose calling three times daily would be excessive too? [Nervous laugh] The watercolor class does meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. [thoughtfully] Margaret from book club mentioned she's taking it; maybe I could actually join her.
116 [firmly] Dr. Martinez, I need to discuss a serious breach of professional boundaries involving my therapist, Dr. Sarah Chen—license number 47B-2019. [pause] She friended me on Facebook last Tuesday, May 14th, and [voice rising] has been commenting on all my personal posts.
117 [frustrated] It started innocently enough with a friend request around 9:30 PM, but then—[sighs heavily]—she liked seventeen photos from my 2018 vacation. [incredulous] She even commented "Looking great!" on my beach photos, which felt... invasive.
118 [hesitant] Well, during our last three sessions she kept mentioning her divorce proceedings. [voice breaking] She spent maybe 20 minutes—20 minutes!—of my $175 session talking about her ex-husband Gary. [sarcastically] Really therapeutic for ME, you know?
119 [defensively] I blocked her immediately after she sent me a private message at 11:47 PM asking if I wanted to grab coffee! [groans] My anxiety is through the roof—isn't she supposed to be helping with that?
120 [upset] Honestly? I feel betrayed and—[voice shaking]—I don't know if I can trust another therapist here. [bitterly] I've been coming to this clinic since 2021, and now I'm considering filing with the state board, license complaint form 45-C.
121 [skeptically] How do I know this won't happen again with therapist number—what would this be—four? [sighs] I specifically requested someone experienced when I filled out intake form 12-B, and look where that got me.
122 [considering] Dr. Wong... I've heard good things about him from the support group that meets Wednesdays. [cautiously hopeful] If you're personally guaranteeing oversight with your supervisor license—SV-8823, right?—then maybe I'll give it one more try.
123 [relieved] Thank you for taking this seriously, unlike the office manager who said I was "overreacting" yesterday. [more firmly] I want everything documented though—every incident from May 14th through today, May 21st.
124 [tired] Employee 10847—Rebecca something—she practically rolled her eyes at me. [sighs deeply] I just want to feel safe in therapy again, you know? [quietly] Is that too much to ask for my mental health investment?
125 [gratefully] I appreciate you listening and actually doing something about this mess. [pause] [cautiously] Will Dr. Chen still have access to my files—all those notes from our 23 sessions?
126 [briskly] Alright, let's check your water softener settings real quick. [confidently] Your hardness should be set to match your water test results—what number did you get, [quickly] somewhere between 7 and 25 grains?
127 [reassuringly] No worries, grains just measure how hard your water is. [more quickly] Did you get a test kit with the unit, or—actually, let me ask—[direct] when you run water, do you see white spots on dishes?
128 [concerned] Every week? [sharp intake] That's way too much salt—you're probably stuck in constant regeneration. [rapidly] Quick question: what's your capacity setting showing, and [more urgently] is the time display blinking or solid?
129 [quickly] No, no, we can fix this right now. [determined] That twelve hundred is your capacity—totally wrong for residential use. [instructive tone] Press and hold the up arrow, [more slowly] then tap down twice when it beeps.
130 [excited] Perfect, that's your hardness setting! [rapidly] Twenty-five is actually pretty hard water, so that explains the spots. [more patiently] Now hit next—we need to set regeneration to, um, [calculating] probably every four days for your household.
131 [professionally] You'll hear it regenerate at 2 AM—sounds like rushing water for about ninety minutes. [reassuring] The spots should disappear within a week, and [enthusiastically] your soap will get super sudsy, almost too much actually.
132 [amused chuckle] Ghost plumbers, that's a new one. [instructively] Check salt monthly, not weekly—it should be at least [emphasizing] one-third full, but [quickly] never pack it to the top, that causes bridges.
133 [sympathetically] Salt bridges are just hardened salt chunks that block water flow. [more briskly] Look, I'll email you our quick-start guide, but [confidently] honestly, you're all set now—these settings should handle everything automatically.
134 [chuckles warmly] Most customers never need those other buttons anyway. [reassuringly] The guide covers the basics—hardness, regeneration time, and [quickly] salt level indicators. [firmly] Don't overthink it; water softeners are simpler than they seem.
135 [kindly] Hey, nobody's born knowing water chemistry. [encouragingly] You figured out the settings faster than most people do, and [briskly] now you're good for probably years—just salt, wait, and enjoy spot-free dishes.
136 [Angry] I mean, the dishes have been sitting there for—what, three weeks now? [Groan] And there's literally mold growing on them.
137 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, the magical cleaning fairy is gonna come and, uh, take care of everything, right? [Tsk]
138 [Whisper] Honestly, I kinda snuck their dirty laundry into their bed last night. [Chuckle] Don't tell them it was me.
139 [Disappointed] We had this whole agreement when we moved in, and you're just—you're not even trying anymore. [Sigh]
140 [Fast] I can't have my parents visit tomorrow with the place looking like—like some kind of disaster zone, you know?
141 [Happy] Wait, you actually cleaned the bathroom? [Laugh] This is like Christmas morning!
142 [Sad] I dunno if I can keep living like this, it's just... it's exhausting having to be everyone's mom. [Slow]
143 [Shout] That's my grandmother's plate you left rotting in your room! [Angry] How could you be so careless?
144 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, stepping on your pizza crust at 3 AM was exactly how I wanted to start my day.
145 [Slow] You know what, I'm done asking nicely—either you start cleaning or, um, or I'm calling the landlord. [Disappointed]
146 [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I just sit in my car after work 'cause I don't wanna deal with the mess at home.
147 [Chuckle] Remember when you said you were "super organized"? [Sarcastic] That was a good one.
148 [Happy] [Fast] My sister's moving to town and she needs a roommate, so I'm thinking—actually, I'm definitely moving out next month!
149 [Angry] [Slow] Every single surface in this kitchen is sticky, and I haven't cooked here in weeks.
150 [Disappointed] Look, I've tried being understanding about your, uh, your depression and stuff, but this is getting unhealthy for both of us. [Sigh]
151 [Tsk] The smell from your room is literally—I mean, I can smell it from the front door now. [Groan]
152 [Sad] [Whisper] I used to love this apartment, but now it's like living in someone else's garbage.
153 [Fast] [Angry] I'm not your parent, your maid, or your—your whatever, okay? Just clean up after yourself!
154 [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Wow, you moved the trash bag three inches closer to the door—progress!
155 [Slow] Honestly? I've started looking for a new place 'cause this whole situation is just—it's not gonna work. [Disappointed] [Sigh]
156 Oh my god, are you—are you seriously mad about that? I was just trying to help! You've been saying you're ready to get back out there, so I thought—I dunno, I thought you'd appreciate it.
157 You literally did! Last month at Casey's thing, you were like "maybe it's time" and I—look, if you didn't mean it, fine, but don't act like I'm making this up.
158 Okay okay, but it's not just that. You're always—[sigh] you're always talking about how everyone's paired off and you're the only single one, so excuse me for thinking you wanted to change that.
159 That's not—come on, that's not what I'm doing. I'm trying to be a good friend! Like, sorry for caring about your happiness, I guess?
160 Then what's it about? Because from where I'm standing, you're—you're getting upset at me for literally just introducing you to people. That's what friends do!
161 That's... okay that's an exaggeration and you know it. Maybe like, three times? Four? [frustrated laugh] And honestly, you seemed into it with Alex, so I don't get why you're suddenly—
162 I'm not deciding anything! I'm just—ugh, I'm creating opportunities, that's all. You can say no. You have said no! Multiple times! And I've been fine with it!
163 Yeah, because I thought—look look, maybe I misread things, okay? But you gotta understand, watching you be miserable and lonely is really hard, and I'm just trying to—
164 I mean... yeah? Kinda? You literally never wanna go home after we hang out, you're always texting at like 2am about feeling disconnected, so I—I dunno what else to call it. [scoff] But apparently trying to help makes me the bad guy.
165 I never said you were broken! Jesus, you're really—you're twisting everything I say. I'm sorry if I pushed too hard, alright? But maybe, just maybe, you could've just talked to me about it instead of... whatever this is.
166 Wait, what? Saturday? I mean—nobody told me it was definitely happening. Last I heard you guys were still figuring out if you were even gonna do anything.
167 Okay okay, but how was I supposed to know? You said "maybe we'll do something" like two weeks ago and then—[scoff]—literally nothing after that. I'm not a mind reader.
168 I could've—seriously? That's not how invites work. You don't just assume you're invited to something nobody actually invited you to. That's like, presumptuous or whatever.
169 No! I didn't forget, I just—I didn't think it was real. There was no time, no place, no "hey we're definitely doing this." You're acting like I deliberately skipped it when I didn't even know it was happening. [frustrated laugh]
170 Yeah well maybe everyone else got actual information? I dunno, maybe I'm just not in the loop anymore. Is that—is that what this is about?
171 But that's kinda what it feels like. Look look, I'm sorry I wasn't there, okay? But I'm also a little—you could've just texted me. One text. "Hey, Saturday's on." That's all.
172 What does that even mean? We're friends, not—I'm not psychic. If you want me somewhere, just tell me. I literally always show up when I know about stuff.
173 Oh come on, that's—[sigh]—that's not fair and you know it. Name one time I've bailed when I actually knew something was happening. One time.
174 Nobody's asking you to chase me down! I'm asking for like, basic communication. A text, a call, literally anything that says "this is happening" instead of "maybe we'll do something."
175 That's—okay, you're being sarcastic, but honestly? Yeah. Please do. Because apparently I'm the only one who needs actual words to know plans are real, and I'm kinda tired of feeling like the bad friend here when I genuinely didn't know.
176 SCENARIO: debating whether to wave back at someone who might not be waving at them
177 [whining] I don't want broccoli! [louder] It looks like tiny trees and trees are yucky! [crossing arms sound] Why can't I just have cookies for dinner? [pleading] Pleeease mommy, just this one time, I promise I'll eat vegetables tomorrow!
178 [suspicious] Cheese won't make it better. [dramatically] The green is still there hiding underneath! [fake crying] My tummy says no thank you! [whispered confession] Maybe if you made it into dinosaur shapes? But probably not even then.
179 [negotiating] Only if I get ice cream after. [quickly] And not the healthy kind with fruit! [stubbornly] Real chocolate ice cream with sprinkles on top. [mumbling] And maybe then I'll think about possibly considering eating one microscopic piece.
180 [offended gasp] Emma is weird! [tattling voice] She eats salad for fun! [disgusted] That's not normal, mommy. [matter-of-factly] I think her taste buds might be broken or something. Mine work perfectly—that's why vegetables taste so terrible.
181 [thoughtful humming] Pizza is different though. [excitedly] It has cheese and bread and yummy red sauce! [back to whining] Broccoli is just... green. [dramatically flopping] Nothing good has ever been green except maybe green lollipops!
182 [considering] Those don't count! [defensively] They're fruit and candy, not vegetables. [brightening suddenly] Wait, if you blend the broccoli into a smoothie with lots of berries, [calculating] then technically I wouldn't taste it, right?
183 [heavy sigh] Fiiiiine. [dramatically] But I need ketchup. [demanding] Lots and lots of ketchup! [warning tone] And if I throw up, it's your fault and you have to clean it all by yourself, okay?
184 [chewing reluctantly] It's... [surprised] not the worst thing ever. [suspiciously] Did you do something different? [accusingly] You tricked me somehow! This tastes like... almost like real food that humans could eat without dying!
185 [mouth full] Can we read two stories? [swallowing] Since I'm being so brave? [proudly] I bet no other kid in the whole world has ever eaten this much broccoli! [hopeful whisper] Maybe even three stories?
186 [giggling] I'm not making a face! [protestingly] This is just how I look when I'm being the bravest. [triumphantly] There, all done! [sing-song voice] Now you have to keep your promise about stories and tomorrow's smoothie!
187 [tense] The seating chart needs to be finalized by tomorrow morning. [speaking rapidly] I've color-coded everyone by dietary restrictions, family dynamics, and [sharp exhale] conversation compatibility. [firmly] We cannot have Uncle Gerald near the bar or your college friends.
188 [high-pitched] Entertainment?! [gasping breath] This is my wedding, not some social experiment! [getting louder] The centerpieces alone cost three hundred dollars each, and I will not have chaos disrupting the ambiance I've spent months cultivating!
189 [through gritted teeth] The timeline says hair and makeup starts at six AM sharp. [urgent whisper] That means five-thirty arrival for prep. [snapping] I've already sent seventeen reminders to the group chat—did you even read them?
190 [shrieking] Seven?! [choking sound] The photographer arrives at eight-fifteen! [frantically] We have exactly two hours and fifteen minutes for six people's complete transformations, [voice breaking] and you're suggesting we lose an entire hour?
191 [coldly] Speaking of perfection, the bachelorette party needs a detailed itinerary. [building intensity] I'm thinking wine tasting at two, spa at four, [loud] dinner at seven-thirty sharp! [controlling] Everyone must RSVP with their exact meal choices.
192 [exasperated sigh] "Just happen"? [incredulous] Do you know what "just happens" when things aren't planned? [voice rising] Disasters! Forgotten vendors! [practically screaming] Missing bridesmaids! The wrong flowers! Complete and utter chaos everywhere!
193 [defensively] That was different! [voice cracking] This is the actual wedding! [pleading] Two hundred people are watching, judging, taking photos that will exist forever! [whispered panic] What if something goes wrong and it's all anyone remembers?
194 [wavering] You really think people won't care if the napkins don't match the invitations? [nervous laugh] I spent three weeks choosing between "ivory" and "cream." [more quietly] Sometimes I dream about color swatches attacking me at night.
195 [hopefully] Really? You'd do that? [quick exhale] Okay, the processional timing, making sure Grandma takes her medication, and [firmly] keeping my mother away from the microphone during speeches. [lighter] Those are absolutely non-negotiable, life-or-death priorities.
196 [relieved sigh] Thank you. [becoming emotional] I know I'm being crazy, but this day has to be perfect. [voice softening] Not for Instagram or the guests, but [catching breath] because I've dreamed about this since I was seven.
197 [defensive] Ma'am, I inspected that property on October 15th, report number HI-2023-8847. [more firmly] My documentation clearly states that I had limited access to the basement due to, uh, stored items blocking the area. [steadier] Did you not read page 17 of the inspection report?
198 [irritated] Mrs. Rodriguez, I photographed everything visible during my three-hour inspection. [sighs heavily] The seller had stacked furniture and boxes up to the ceiling in that corner, specifically grid reference B-4 through B-7. [more defensive] I can't x-ray through people's belongings!
199 [frustrated exhale] Look, moisture readings in adjacent areas showed 11-12% on my meter, completely normal range. [more insistent] Without visible access or elevated readings, I... I followed standard protocol ASHI-2019 guidelines. [firmly] Every inspection has limitations, which you acknowledged by signing!
200 [sympathetically] I understand you're upset, and eighteen thousand is... that's significant. [carefully] However, my liability is capped at the inspection fee per our contract, section 9.2.A. [sighs] Have you contacted the seller about disclosure obligations?
201 [apologetically] Mrs. Rodriguez, I'll... I'll review my photos from that day again, check if anything was missed. [hesitant] Send me your contractor's report to inspector@hendersonhi.com, and perhaps we can, um, discuss a partial refund? [wearily] Though I maintain I followed proper procedures.
202 [shouting] What do you mean my daughter has a broken arm?! [voice cracking] I dropped her off at 8:15 this morning perfectly fine, and now you're telling me she's at—at Memorial Hospital on 2847 Oak Street?!
203 [furiously] The playground equipment? [louder] Which one exactly, because I specifically filled out form 23-B stating she wasn't allowed on the climbing tower! [voice trembling] This is completely unacceptable!
204 [incredulous] Backwards?! [shouting] Where was the supervision? [sarcastically] Don't I pay $1,850 a month for you people to actually watch these kids?
205 [voice breaking] Don't give me that! [more angrily] I want to see the security footage from cameras 3 and 4 in the playground area. [demanding] And I want copies of every single staff certification by tomorrow morning!
206 [bitterly] Oh, how convenient, more paperwork! [louder] My four-year-old is in the hospital with a fractured radius, and you're worried about—about protocols? [scoffs] This is lawsuit material, you understand that?
207 [quieter] I'm already in my car, doing 75 on Interstate 405! [voice shaking] But don't think this conversation is over. [firmly] I want a meeting with the director Monday at 9 AM sharp!
208 [sarcastically] Your best wishes? [louder] That's really helpful right now! [sighs heavily] Just have all the documentation ready, including Teacher Rodriguez's file and that other child's information.
209 [frustrated] Privacy laws! [groans] My baby is hurt and you're protecting the kid who caused this? [more controlled] Fine, but I want the parents contacted—room 4B, the Mitchell boy, right?
210 [exhausted] You have no idea. [voice cracking] She's four years old, she was so excited about show-and-tell today, brought her—her favorite stuffed unicorn. [sniffling] Now she's getting X-rays instead.
211 [softer] She did? [sighs] That sounds like my Emma. [more firmly] Look, I'm pulling into the hospital now, parking garage level C-3. [determined] But this isn't over, not by a long shot.
212 [Slow] So, um, just gonna keep looking at that poster on the wall—is that, is that a beach or mountains? [Fast] I honestly can't tell from here.
213 [Happy] Hey, you know what, I'm actually doing pretty good—like, way better than last time! [Chuckle]
214 [Whisper] Okay, okay, breathing in... and out... just like they—wait, am I supposed to squeeze this thing now? [Sigh]
215 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, "just a little pinch," they said—more like a, uh, like a very aggressive mosquito, right? [Tsk]
216 [Fast] Is it normal that I can kinda hear my heartbeat or is that just—no, that's probably fine, totally fine.
217 [Sad] I really wanna help people, I do, but my arm is feeling so—I mean, it's worth it though. [Slow] Right?
218 [Angry] Why did I look—I specifically told myself not to look at the needle and then I just—ugh! [Groan]
219 [Disappointed] I thought I'd be, you know, braver about this whole thing by now. [Sigh] Guess not.
220 [Slow] The nurse seems nice—she's got, um, really steady hands, which is... that's good, that's what you want. [Chuckle]
221 Eight minutes, she said eight minutes, so that's basically—wait, has it only been two? [Fast] [Groan]
222 [Happy] You know what, I'm literally saving lives here, so a little—a little wooziness is nothing! [Laugh]
223 [Whisper] Don't think about the bag, don't think about the bag, don't think about—oh God, I'm thinking about the bag. [Tsk]
224 [Shout] Wait, is it supposed to feel cold like that? [Fast] That's—that's a normal sensation, right?
225 [Sarcastic] Sure, let's chat about the weather while there's a tube in my—yeah, lovely sunshine we're having! [Chuckle] [Sigh]
226 I'm gonna get juice after this, right—they promised juice and, um, maybe those little cookies? [Happy] [Fast]
227 [Slow] My mom always said I was brave for doing this, but honestly I just—I dunno if she'd still think that seeing me now. [Disappointed]
228 [Angry] No, no, I'm fine, I just—I hate when people hover, y'know? [Fast] Seriously, I got this!
229 [Whisper] If I just count ceiling tiles backwards from fifty, it'll be over before—forty-nine, forty-eight... [Slow]
230 [Sad] I keep thinking about all the people who need this and—actually, that kinda helps? [Sigh] Sort of?
231 [Happy] Almost done—wait, really, that's it? [Laugh] I basically psyched myself out over nothing!
232 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly talking about a shared document they edited, then checking the history, then seeing everyone can see their embarrassing edit history, spiraling into document transparency horror
233 Wait wait wait—the launch? THE launch? Oh my god, how did it—actually no, first tell me, like, are you okay? You must be exhausted.
234 Four—[Gasp] are you kidding me right now? That's like, that's literally insane! All of it? Even the, um, what was it—the highlighter collection?
235 Stop it. Stop—okay that's actually iconic though? Like your website literally couldn't handle how badly people wanted your stuff. That's—wow. How are you feeling about it?
236 Weird like... good weird or like "I wanna hide under my blanket for a week" weird? Because honestly both are, y'know, totally valid responses to becoming basically overnight successful.
237 No no no, babe, it wasn't broken—people just really, really wanted what you made. [Chuckle] God, remember when you were like mixing formulas in your kitchen at 2am?
238 And now—now you're sold out! Like completely sold out! Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it, especially your mom.
239 Okay okay, that's—that's fair. It's a lot, right? Like one day you're just... you, and then suddenly you're this person who created something everyone wants. That's gotta be kinda terrifying.
240 Oh god, already? Can't people just like—I dunno, let you breathe for five seconds? [Sigh] Actually wait, that's a good problem though, right? People wanting more?
241 You're right, you're—yeah. But like, you did this. You actually did the thing everyone said was impossible. Starting a makeup brand from nothing? That's... I mean, come on.
242 Luck? Are you—no. Nope. Lucky is finding twenty bucks on the street, okay? This was you working until 4am every night, testing everything on literally everyone we know, redoing the packaging like what—seven times? That's not luck, babe. That's you being brilliant.
243 Oh. Oh no, wait—what did I say? I mean, we were talking about a bunch of stuff and I—did I say something wrong? Because if I did, I honestly didn't mean to—
244 But you're so good with that tech stuff! I just assumed—I mean, you're always talking about coding and I thought—okay, yeah, I shouldn't have assumed. [nervous laugh] I was just trying to help, y'know?
245 I know, I know, I do this thing where I—where I think I know what you want and then I just... run with it. God, I'm doing it again right now, aren't I? Assuming you wanna hear my explanation when maybe you just need me to shut up and listen.
246 That was—okay that was really stupid. I saw you texting someone and smiling and I just—I got excited for you? And then your mom asked how you were doing and it just... came out. [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever.
247 Oh my god. Of course you were. See this is—this is exactly what you mean, right? I just make up these whole stories in my head about your life and then I go around spreading them like they're facts. I don't even—I don't even ask you first.
248 I think I'm being helpful or—or supportive or whatever, but I'm actually just... making your life harder. Putting you in awkward situations where you gotta explain that no, actually, your friend is just an idiot who can't keep her mouth shut.
249 No, I—I honestly hadn't thought about it like that. [sigh] That must be so frustrating, having to do damage control all the time because I can't just... ask you stuff directly. I'm really, really sorry.
250 Because you mentioned lawyers once! Which is—yeah, no, that's insane. That's actually insane logic. I don't know why I do this, I think maybe I just get so excited about stuff for you that I don't stop to think if it's even real?
251 You're right. You're completely right. I keep—I keep filling in blanks that aren't mine to fill. Like I'm writing your story instead of letting you tell it yourself, and that's... that's really messed up actually.
252 I'm gonna—I'm gonna work on this. Like, really work on it. Next time I wanna say something about you to someone, I'll just... ask you first? Or better yet, keep my mouth shut entirely. You deserve a friend who actually listens to who you are, not—not someone who makes stuff up.
253 Wait wait wait—WHAT? You—oh my god, you actually won? Like, THE pitch competition? The one with all those, um, those crazy investors?
254 Twenty—okay I'm literally gonna scream. This is huge! Why are you being so, like, so calm about this? [Laugh] You just beat out what, like fifty other startups?
255 SEVENTY—okay no, that's insane. That's actually insane. How are you not, like, bouncing off the walls right now? I mean, I'm bouncing off the walls and it's not even my thing!
256 Weird how? Like, um, imposter syndrome weird or like—wait, are you worried about actually having to, y'know, deliver now?
257 Okay but—but yours was better, right? That's literally why you won. The judges didn't just, like, randomly pick your name out of a [Chuckle] hat or something.
258 Oh. Oh, honey, that's—ugh, of course they haven't. But you know what? This isn't about them. This is your thing, your win, your... everything.
259 No no no, not "I guess"—you literally just secured funding for your dream! That's—do you know how many people never even get to pitch? Let alone win?
260 Well yeah, but like... good pressure? The kind where people actually believe in you enough to, um, to invest actual money? That's kinda [Sigh] incredible when you think about it.
261 Okay first of all—you won't. Second, even if things get messy, which they will because, hello, startup life—you've already proven you can handle it. You convinced those judges, didn't you?
262 Wait, you almost—and you still killed it? That's even more impressive! See, you're like, you're basically unstoppable when you're terrified, which is honestly the best superpower.
263 Oh, come on—not this again. Look, I was just trying to get everyone to have a good time, okay? You're acting like I forced a bottle down your throat or something.
264 Because you were sitting there all—I dunno, uptight? Everyone else was having fun and you were just... there. I thought maybe if you loosened up a bit you'd actually [scoff] enjoy yourself for once.
265 Okay okay, but like—it's not that serious. I was being playful! You know me, that's just how I am. I didn't think you'd get all bent out of shape about it.
266 That's—okay that's taken completely out of context and you know it. I was joking around! Everyone was laughing, even you kinda smiled at one point, so don't act like I was being this huge bully.
267 Fine, whatever, but you're making this into something way bigger than it needs to be. Like, honestly? [frustrated laugh] I'm a little disappointed that you think I'd actually try to hurt you or something. That's not—I'm not that person.
268 I didn't—look look, if I embarrassed you, that wasn't the plan, alright? But you're kinda embarrassing me right now by making me out to be this terrible friend when I was literally just trying to include you.
269 They weren't—ugh, they weren't mean names! It was teasing! There's a difference! And honestly, you've been so judge-y lately about everyone who drinks, so maybe I got a little defensive, okay? [sigh] But I wasn't trying to pressure you.
270 No, I was—I was trying to help you not feel left out! There's a difference between encouraging someone and pressuring them. You just... you always assume the worst about everything I do lately.
271 Keep doing—what, trying to be your friend? Trying to make sure you're having fun? I mean, I'm sorry if my methods aren't perfect, but at least I'm trying. You just shut down and get all cold like this.
272 Fine. Fine, I'll—I'll back off about the drinking stuff. But just so we're clear, I still think you're overreacting, and it kinda sucks that you can't see I was coming from a good place. But whatever, message received.
273 What? No, that's—that's next week, isn't it? I swear I had it in my calendar for next Tuesday.
274 Oh god. Oh—okay, wait wait wait, let me check my—[groan] shit. I must've put it in wrong. But honestly, you could've reminded me? Like, a text or something?
275 That's not—come on, you know how crazy things have been for me lately. I'm basically drowning in work stuff, my mom's been sick, I haven't slept properly in like a week. I'm sorry I forgot, but I'm not a machine.
276 And I get that, I do. But you're acting like I did this to spite you or something. It was a mistake—a shitty one, yeah, but still just a mistake. [frustrated laugh] I've literally been there for everything else.
277 That's—wow, okay. So all the other times I showed up don't count now? All the times I dropped everything to help you? None of that matters because I screwed up once while my life is falling apart?
278 Yeah, and I'm sorry! I am. But I'm also kinda pissed that you can't see I'm barely keeping my head above water here. Like, I forgot one thing—one important thing, fine—but I didn't do it on purpose.
279 Is it though? Because intent matters, doesn't it? I mean—look, if you wanna be mad, be mad, but don't act like I'm some terrible friend who doesn't care about you. That's not fair.
280 And I meant to be! I wanted to be there, honestly. But I—I can't keep track of everything right now. [sigh] I know that's not what you wanna hear, but it's the truth.
281 Don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down on me. I messed up, okay okay, I admit it. But you're not even trying to understand what I'm dealing with. It's like my stuff doesn't matter at all.
282 You're right. It was. And I—I blew it. But I dunno what you want from me here. I can't go back and fix it, and you clearly don't wanna hear that I'm sorry, so... what now?
283 SCENARIO: trying to decide if they should get gas now or later
284 [frustrated growl] Three months! [louder] Three damn months chasing shadows and what do we have? [bitter laugh] A board full of red string leading to absolutely nothing but another corpse in the morgue.
285 [manic energy] You know what? [ripping sound] Let's start fresh! [shouting] This board is cursed anyway! Watch me tear down every useless photo, every dead-end timeline, every lying witness statement right now!
286 [panting heavily] Look at this! [sarcastic sing-song] "Suspect seen at 9:15 PM." [venomous] Except he was also magically across town at the same time according to twelve different cameras!
287 [exhausted groan] The captain's breathing down our necks. [mockingly high-pitched] "Any progress, detectives?" [normal voice, defeated] Progress? We're moving backwards at the speed of light into complete insanity here.
288 [sudden realization] Wait. [slowly] What if that's exactly the point? [building excitement] What if the randomness, the impossible evidence, the contradictions—what if it's all intentional misdirection?
289 [cold determination] No, listen. [faster] Every "mistake" we found, every impossibility—they required inside knowledge. [triumphant] Someone who knows our procedures, our blind spots, our investigation methods. Someone close.
290 [grimly certain] Look at the board again. [commanding] Or what's left of it. Every breakthrough we almost had got leaked, every safe house compromised. [whispered accusation] That's not luck.
291 [quietly intense] And the evidence that went missing from lockup? [building anger] The security logs that got corrupted? [shouting] The autopsy reports that got "accidentally" shredded? All internal access required!
292 [energized] But they made a mistake! [rapid speech] Destroying evidence leaves traces too. [determined] Security badges, access logs, timestamp discrepancies—we just weren't looking at our own people before.
293 [deadly serious] We tell no one. [firm] Not the captain, not our partners, nobody. [whispered urgency] We rebuild this board in secret and this time, we hunt from within.
294 [patiently] Sir, I see here your claim number is actually JX-77892-B. [concerned] Now, according to your form, you listed the accident date as February 31st, but [gently] that date doesn't exist?
295 [measured tone] I understand this is difficult, Mr. Thompson. [more firmly] However, I need accurate information—your policy number 55A-9982-C shows you reported damages of, um, [puzzled] "one million dollars to the bumper"?
296 [sympathetic] Have you seen a doctor about that, sir? [professional] Your medical coverage under section 14-B allows for up to $15,000 in treatment, but [cautiously] you need proper documentation from a licensed physician.
297 [slightly exasperated] Mr. Thompson, I'll need those exact medical record numbers. [more patiently] Also, you've listed your vehicle as a "2019 Toyota Ferrari"—[confused] could you clarify the actual make and model, please?
298 [reassuring] We're almost done here, sir, just a few more questions. [clearly] Your witness, listed as "Bob from the gas station"—[professionally] I'll need his full name and contact number for verification.
299 [sighs quietly] Sir, regarding the other driver's insurance—[reading] you wrote their company as "All-Snake" insurance? [questioning] Did you perhaps mean Allstate, policy holder Marcus Webb, account MW-4429-X?
300 [carefully] According to police report 2024-1147-B, the incident occurred at Oak and Fifth Avenue. [helpfully] Does that help refresh your memory? [concerned] The responding officer was Badge 5584, Officer Martinez.
301 [trying to refocus] Let's concentrate on the damages, Mr. Thompson. [reading carefully] You're claiming $3,200 for vehicle repair, $800 for rental car fees, [pause] and, um, "$50 for emotional damage to pet rock"?
302 [professionally] I'll process the legitimate claims totaling $4,000. [instructive tone] You'll receive confirmation at your email—[checking] is it still punchyboxer1981 at hotmail? [more firmly] Please respond to verification code XB-9902 within 48 hours.
303 [with finality] I'll send to both addresses to be safe. [reassuring] Your case manager will be Jennifer Park, extension 4556. [warmly] Please see a doctor about that head injury, Mr. Thompson, and [firmly] have a safe day.
304 [briskly] Tech support, this is Jordan speaking, how can I help you today? [more cheerfully] I see you're calling about an update issue—let me pull up your account real quick.
305 [sympathetically] Oh, that's incredibly frustrating, I completely understand. [quickly] Let's get this sorted right away—first, can you tell me, um, which version you're currently running? [more urgently] Should be under Settings, then About.
306 [reassuringly] Okay, okay, we'll definitely get this fixed before then. [rapidly] Here's what we're gonna do—I'm seeing a known issue with that specific build that affects, uh, about twelve percent of users. [more confidently] There's a workaround though.
307 [patiently] No worries at all, I get it—technology can be maddening sometimes. [quickly] So first, you'll need to boot into safe mode, then—this is important—disable the security suite temporarily. [more slowly] I'll walk you through each step.
308 [briskly] Absolutely! Power completely off first, then hold volume down while pressing power. [more deliberately] Keep holding until you see the logo appear twice—not once, twice—that's the tricky part most people miss.
309 [enthusiastically] Perfect! You're doing great. [rapidly] Now navigate to Settings, Security, and toggle off the enhanced protection—just temporarily. [more carefully] After that, retry the update from the beginning.
310 [encouragingly] Excellent, that's exactly what should happen! [quickly] While that's running, let me just document this issue for our development team—they really need to push a proper fix. [more firmly] This shouldn't be happening to customers.
311 [relieved chuckle] Sometimes it's the smallest things that cause the biggest headaches. [briskly] Once it completes, you can re-enable security—the conflict only happens during installation, not after.
312 [warmly] Hey, that's what we're here for! [quickly] Just remember for future updates—if you hit that same wall, try the safe mode trick first. [more casually] Saves everyone time and frustration.
313 [confidently] Actually, yes—the fix is already in beta testing. [rapidly] Version nine point zero should roll out within two weeks, and it completely eliminates this compatibility issue. [reassuringly] Your future updates should be smooth sailing.
314 [Slow] So basically, I sit at a computer all day and, um, I write code that tells other computers how to—[Sigh] okay, imagine I'm teaching robots to talk to each other.
315 [Fast] No no no, it's not like CSI where I'm typing really fast and screens are flashing—[Laugh] that's just Hollywood nonsense, y'know?
316 [Happy] Oh, you've heard of spreadsheets? [Chuckle] Well, I kinda make those dance and do tricks they weren't supposed to do!
317 [Sarcastic] Yeah, I'm basically a professional email sender who occasionally does actual work. [Tsk] Super glamorous, right?
318 [Whisper] Between you and me, half the time I'm just googling how to fix things—[Fast] but don't tell my boss that.
319 [Disappointed] I thought it'd be more creative, but honestly? [Slow] Most days I'm just, er, moving numbers from one place to another place.
320 [Angry] No, I don't fix printers! [Groan] Why does everyone think—just because I work with computers doesn't mean I know why your printer's jammed!
321 [Slow] Think of it like, um, like being a translator? [Happy] Except instead of languages, I'm translating human thoughts into machine language!
322 [Sad] My parents still don't get what I do, and I've been trying to explain for—[Sigh] it's been five years now.
323 [Fast] Okay so you know when you order something online and it shows up? [Excited] I make sure all those little steps in between actually happen!
324 [Sarcastic] I attend meetings about meetings, and then we schedule follow-ups to discuss the meetings about meetings—[Disappointed] it's thrilling stuff, truly.
325 [Shout] Wait, that's actually a perfect example! [Happy] See how your phone just did that thing? I program stuff like that!
326 [Whisper] Honestly? Some days I barely understand it myself—[Chuckle] but as long as the paycheck clears, right?
327 [Slow] It's kinda like being a detective, except, um, instead of solving crimes, I'm figuring out why—[Fast] why everything broke at 3 AM last Tuesday.
328 [Disappointed] Everyone thinks it's super high-tech, but I literally spend most of my time in—[Tsk] in boring conference calls.
329 [Happy] You ever play with LEGOs as a kid? [Fast] It's basically that but with invisible pieces that sometimes explode!
330 [Angry] I don't just "play on Facebook all day"—I mean, okay, sometimes, but—[Groan] there's actual work involved, I swear!
331 [Sad] The worst part is when people's eyes glaze over and they just—[Slow] they just nod politely while I'm explaining.
332 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, I "work from home," which apparently means I'm available to accept packages for the entire neighborhood—[Laugh] because I'm obviously not doing anything important.
333 [Whisper] Want to know a secret? [Fast] Most of what I do could probably be automated, but, uh, let's keep that between us, yeah?
334 SCENARIO: Excited about a new relationship, then insecure about a text, then gets a reassuring reply
335 Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, you got approved? That's huge! I mean, that's literally huge! When did you find out?
336 The specificity! [Laugh] Okay but like, how are you feeling? Because this is—I mean, you're gonna be a homeowner! That's kinda wild, right?
337 Um, okay, you don't sound—are you not excited? Because like, I'm basically vibrating for you right now and you're giving me nothing here.
338 Oh no no no, don't—don't do that thing where you spiral about the numbers. Everyone freaks about the numbers. It's like, it's totally normal to be scared, y'know?
339 Okay but—[Sigh] listen, you did the math, right? Like a million times? And the bank literally just said yes, you can do this, so...
340 Stop it! You're not—this isn't a mistake. You've been saving for like, what, five years? Six? That down payment didn't just appear outta nowhere.
341 See? See, there's that—okay that was almost a joke. We're making progress. But seriously, which place was it? The one with the—the weird purple bathroom?
342 Blue, purple, whatever—point is, you loved that place! I mean, you literally wouldn't shut up about the kitchen. Well, okay, you mentioned it twice, which for you is basically gushing.
343 It's gonna be YOUR kitchen though! Like you can—I dunno, paint it black if you want. Install those pretentious coffee machines you like. [Chuckle] Nobody can stop you.
344 Uh-huh, sure sure. But like—okay, real talk? I'm really, really proud of you. This is scary but it's also... y'know, it's amazing. You're doing it.
345 Oh my god, okay—wait, are you gonna make me guess or are you just gonna—actually no, your face, something's different. Tell me tell me tell me.
346 I'm sorry, what? Did you just—[Gasp] oh my god. Oh my GOD. That's—holy shit, that's incredible! How much, like, how much is it working?
347 Forty—okay that's, that's huge though, right? Like the doctors, they must be—wait, what did they actually say? Are they like, freaking out? Because I'm freaking out right now.
348 Encouraging? That's—no no no, that's doctor speak for "this is fucking amazing," you know that right? They never get excited about anything. When do you go back?
349 Okay so we're—we're celebrating, right? Like, this is a thing we celebrate? I mean, I know you're all... you, about this stuff, but come on. [Softer] This is good news, babe.
350 Oh, honey. No—that's not, that's not how this works. You can't jinx science, okay? The cells don't care if we get tacos and champagne tonight.
351 Um, yes? It's called class, look it up. But seriously though, how are you—like, how are you actually feeling about all this? Because you seem kinda... I dunno, quiet? Even for you.
352 Oh. Oh, babe. That's—[Sigh] okay, that makes total sense actually. You were protecting yourself, weren't you? And now it's like—wait, now what, right?
353 Well, now you—you get to hope again? I mean, I know that's terrifying as hell, but like... you get to think about next year. Next summer. That trip to Portland we kept saying we'd do.
354 Well start thinking about it, because I'm—we're going, okay? And that's not me being, like, toxically positive or whatever. That's me saying your treatment is working and we're gonna eat so many donuts. So many.
355 Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, you got it? When did you find out? I thought you said it was gonna take like another month or something!
356 And you're just now telling me? That's—that's huge! [Gasp] Holy shit, you're actually going. Like, this is really happening, huh?
357 Okay okay, I mean—of course you are. It's like, it's a lot, y'know? How long did the whole thing take? Because I remember you started this whole process like... what, six months ago?
358 Eight—Jesus. That's basically a whole pregnancy. Except instead of a baby you get... um, paperwork and the right to live somewhere? [Chuckle] Sorry, that was a weird comparison.
359 So when do you—like, when are you actually gonna go? Do you have to leave right away or can you kinda, y'know, take your time with it?
360 Three months is... I mean, that's not nothing but it's also not—shit, that's gonna go by so fast. Are you excited? Scared? Both? I'd be absolutely losing my mind right now, honestly.
361 Yeah, no, that—that makes sense. You've been in limbo for so long, right? Like constantly waiting and checking your email and just... [Sigh] the stress of not knowing must've been exhausting.
362 Oh babe, I—actually I kinda do have an idea because you've been talking about literally nothing else for months. Not that I'm complaining! I'm just saying, like, I could see how much it was eating at you.
363 No no no, don't—don't apologize. That's not what I meant at all. I just... I'm really, really happy for you, y'know? You fought so hard for this.
364 Okay well now—now you're gonna make me cry. [Laugh] We're not saying goodbye yet, alright? We've got three whole months to be disgustingly sentimental. Save it.
365 Wait wait wait—you're turning down orders? That's like—that's actually amazing though, right? I mean, kinda stressful but also... wow.
366 Oh my god, yes yes yes! You're gonna be like, an actual boss now! With employees and everything! [Laugh] Sorry, I'm just—this is so exciting, you've worked so hard for this.
367 No no no, don't downplay it! This is huge! Like, remember when you were worried nobody would even want your stuff? And now you literally can't make it fast enough?
368 How are you even—like, are you sleeping? Eating? Because I know how you get when you're busy, you just kinda... forget to be human.
369 Um, absolutely not. That's—no. [Groan] Okay, I'm bringing you actual food tomorrow. Non-negotiable.
370 The couch too? Oh man, you're really—you're basically living in a workshop now, huh? Have you thought about maybe getting like, an actual space? A studio or something?
371 Yeah but like, if you're turning down orders... I mean, honestly? Sounds like you could probably swing it. Plus your back's gonna hate you if you keep working on the floor.
372 See? See, this is what I'm—[Sigh] you gotta take care of yourself, babe. The business won't run if you break.
373 Of course it is! You went from like, zero to sixty in what—two months? That's insane! But also, y'know, really really incredible.
374 Oh honey, I get that. I really do. But like—okay, remember how happy you were with your first paying customer? That joy's still there, it's just... buried under invoices right now.
375 I—okay, I wasn't totally sure he was gonna show up. Like, Marcus mentioned maybe he'd come but it wasn't—it wasn't definite, you know? I should've told you anyway, I know that now.
376 No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, I guess I did but I swear I thought about texting you like fifty times. I just kept thinking maybe he wouldn't actually come and then—[groan]—then it wouldn't matter, right?
377 That's not what I meant! God, I'm—I'm so bad at this. I wanted to protect you, okay? Like I thought if I told you, you wouldn't come and you've been looking forward to Marcus's party for weeks and I just—I dunno, I convinced myself it would be fine.
378 You're right. You're completely right and I—honestly, I've been feeling sick about it since I saw your face when you walked in. The way you just froze and then looked at me like—[nervous laugh]—like you wanted to kill me, which, fair.
379 Oh god, Emma told you? That's—wait, what did she say? Actually, never mind, doesn't matter. I should've been the one to warn you, I get that. I really really messed up here.
380 Um, like... three days? Maybe four? Marcus told me on Tuesday and I kept—I kept picking up my phone to text you but then I'd chicken out because I didn't wanna be the one to ruin your week, you know?
381 I know, I know. That's so much worse, I see that now. I just—I'm really bad at delivering bad news and I thought maybe, I dunno, maybe you guys could coexist or something? [sigh] I'm an idiot.
382 I wanna fix this. Like, tell me what to do and I'll do it. You want me to—to never talk to Marcus again? Or like, I could make sure you know about every single social event from now on, even the maybes?
383 And that's—that's the bare minimum, right? Like the absolute least I could do as your friend and I couldn't even... god, I'm so sorry. You deserved to know. You deserved to make your own choice about it.
384 I will. I promise I will. No more—no more deciding what's best for you or trying to protect you from stuff. Just straight up honesty from now on, even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard, actually.
385 SCENARIO: realizing they forgot their work badge
386 [shocked] OH MY GOD, is that—is that YOUR profile?! [nervous laughter] I just swiped right as a joke because the bio was hilarious, but [voice rising] I didn't realize it was actually you behind those sunglasses!
387 [hysterical giggling] The algorithm really said "best friends to lovers pipeline" and I'm SCREAMING. [whispered] But honestly, your profile pics are kinda hot? [normal volume] When did you get abs, and why didn't I know about this development?
388 [dramatically] We've been having breakfast together every Sunday for three years. [slower pace] We've seen each other cry over exes, throw up after tequila, and [pause] [quietly] now we're a ninety-eight percent compatibility match?
389 [thoughtfully] You know what's really messing with me here? [gentle tone] The app says we have "exceptional chemistry" based on our answers. [snorting laugh] We couldn't even agree on pizza toppings last night without a twenty-minute debate!
390 [hesitant] This is probably terrible timing but... [trailing off] remember when everyone always asked if we were dating? [quickly] What if we went on one fake date just to see how spectacularly awkward it would be?
391 [excited whisper] Think about it though—we already know each other's worst habits! [building enthusiasm] No surprises, no disappointments, no finding out they're secretly married! [laughing] Plus, I already know you're allergic to shellfish and hate small talk.
392 [mock formal] "Hello, I'm a Sagittarius who enjoys long walks and adventure." [breaking character] [cackling] I can't do this with a straight face when I've literally held your hair back in so many bar bathrooms!
393 [philosophically] Maybe this is the universe telling us something profound and meaningful. [pause] [more casually] Or maybe it's just proof that dating apps are broken when they match people who've already seen each other's retainer face.
394 [mischievously] But what if we're passing up our rom-com moment here? [theatrical] Best friends realize they were meant to be! [deflating] Although knowing us, it'd be more like a comedy special about failed relationships.
395 [suddenly serious] Wait, I just read your "ideal first date" answer. [disbelief] Mini golf and ice cream? [touched] That's literally what we did last Tuesday, except we called it "mental health maintenance."
396 [apologetic] I understand your frustration, sir, and I see you here in our system. [calmly] Unfortunately, we're seeing 47 patients today with, um, more critical conditions. [sighs] Your son's vitals are stable, so he's priority level 3.
397 [more firmly] Sir, we don't discuss other patients' conditions, but I assure you our triage nurses follow strict protocols. [reassuring] The average wait today is approximately 4 hours and 15 minutes. [softer] Would you like me to have someone recheck your son's temperature?
398 [sympathetically] I see the note from Jennifer here, but that was before our two-car accident arrived at 3:22 PM. [steadier] We've had to redirect six doctors to trauma. [sighs deeply] I can move you to urgent care at 1847 West Medical Drive, but their wait is currently 2 hours.
399 [professionally] Priority levels aren't negotiable, sir, they're based on medical assessment criteria in our protocol manual, section 14.3.B. [more gently] However, let me page Dr. Martinez directly. [quietly] She sometimes does quick evaluations between patients, though I can't promise anything.
400 [more compassionately] I'm paging Dr. Martinez now to room 12, and I see your wife's affiliation in our partner network. [warmly] Let me also get you access code W447 for our family comfort room. [softly] It has a bed where your son can lie down while waiting.
401 [professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling Meridian Investments. [briskly] This is Sandra speaking, how may I assist you today?
402 [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [quickly] Let me pull up your account right away—can you provide me with your account number and the last four digits of your social?
403 [reassuringly] Absolutely, Mr. Henderson, I see your account here. [speaking rapidly] Now, I'm showing an ACATS transfer request initiated on October 15th that appears to be pending—um—pending verification of your medallion signature guarantee.
404 [concerned] Oh, I do see one submission from October 20th. [more quickly] However, it seems the bank officer's stamp was partially illegible, so our compliance team couldn't—they couldn't verify the authenticity.
405 [sympathetically] I know this is incredibly frustrating, Mr. Henderson. [briskly] Here's what I can do—I'll escalate this directly to our transfer specialist team and have them review the documentation you've already provided within the next two hours.
406 [more firmly] Sir, I'm personally flagging this as priority status right now. [quickly] Additionally, I'm providing you with a direct callback number—877-555-4421—that bypasses our regular queue entirely.
407 [quickly] Let me check that for you immediately. [pause] [surprised] Oh, I see the issue—the fee was applied in error because the system categorized this as an expedited transfer.
408 [apologetically] You're absolutely right, that's unacceptable. [more quickly] I'm reversing that charge right now, and I'm also applying a courtesy credit of $50 for the inconvenience you've experienced.
409 [confidently] With the priority escalation I'm implementing now, you should see movement within 24 to 48 hours. [rapidly] I'm also sending you a confirmation email with a reference number—TRF-789456—so you can track this directly.
410 [understanding] That's completely within your rights, Mr. Henderson. [quickly] However, I'm confident we'll have this resolved well before then—I'm personally monitoring this case.
411 [Happy] Oh my god, I actually—wait, I won something? [Laugh] This literally never happens to me, like, ever!
412 [Disappointed] It's, uh, it's just a keychain. [Sigh] I mean, I guess it's better than nothing, right?
413 [Fast] [Excited] No way no way no way, did they just call my number? That's mine—that's actually my ticket!
414 [Sarcastic] Wow, a whole five dollars, I can finally retire early. [Tsk] Better call my boss right now.
415 [Whisper] Should I, like, should I go up there now or—I dunno, everyone's kinda staring at me.
416 [Slow] [Happy] You know what? This is... this is actually really sweet. [Chuckle] Made my whole week, honestly.
417 [Angry] Are you—are you kidding me? [Fast] I bought fifty tickets and all I get is this stupid pen?
418 [Sad] My mom would've been so, um, she would've loved seeing me win something, even something small like this. [Sigh]
419 [Shout] That's me! [Laugh] [Fast] Oh my god, I can't believe—sorry, sorry, I'm just really excited!
420 [Disappointed] [Slow] I thought third place would be, I dunno, something bigger than a—what even is this, a bookmark?
421 [Happy] Wait, can I, like, take a picture with it? [Chuckle] My kids are never gonna believe daddy actually won something!
422 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh fantastic, another coffee mug, just what I needed for my collection of, uh, literally dozens of coffee mugs.
423 [Whisper] [Sad] I kinda feel bad taking it when, you know, other people probably wanted it more than—never mind.
424 [Angry] This is rigged—I mean, come on! [Groan] The person next to me gets the TV and I get socks?
425 [Happy] [Slow] Honestly? I don't even care what it is, I just... I never win anything, y'know? [Laugh]
426 [Shout] [Fast] Yes yes yes yes yes! Wait—oh, it's just the small one? [Disappointed] Whatever, I'll take it!
427 [Sarcastic] Ten dollars at Applebee's, um, wow. [Tsk] [Slow] Guess I can almost afford half an appetizer now, right?
428 [Whisper] [Happy] Is this—is this really happening? Like, they're not gonna take it back or anything, are they?
429 [Disappointed] [Fast] I drove forty minutes for this raffle and—ugh, seriously? [Groan] A stress ball? That's it?
430 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Slow] I almost didn't even enter, and now here I am with this, uh, this random little prize.
431 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a misfiled document, then finding it right where it should be
432 Wait wait wait—what? Your first freelance client? Oh my god, that's—that's huge! Like, this is actually happening now, you're really doing the thing!
433 Okay no no no, don't do that. Don't like, minimize it, y'know? This is literally—[Laugh] sorry, I'm getting way too excited but this is your first actual paying client!
434 LinkedIn actually worked? That's—honestly that never happens. What're they, um, what're they having you do? Is it like, is it a good project at least?
435 Two weeks is—that's totally doable. And three concepts means they're gonna actually, like, respect your process and stuff. Did you already talk money? Sorry if that's—I mean, you don't have to tell me.
436 See? See, I told you—wait, did I tell you? I definitely thought about telling you that you were undervaluing yourself. [Chuckle] This is so good though, like, really.
437 Oh, babe, no—you're not gonna mess it up. You're literally, you're so talented it's actually annoying sometimes? Plus like, they came to you, right? They already want what you do.
438 Okay but—but that's different from not knowing how, y'know? You've got the skills, you just gotta, um, dust them off a little. [Sigh] Are you freaking out? You're freaking out.
439 That's—honestly that's so normal though. Like, I'd be worried if you weren't kinda nervous? It means you care about doing good work, which is exactly why they're gonna love you.
440 Of course you did! See, you're already—you're in it, you're doing the thing! Can I, can I see them? Or is it too early? I promise I won't be weird about it.
441 Yes yes yes! Oh man, this is—I'm so proud of you, seriously. Like, you took the leap and the universe just... caught you, y'know?
442 Oh god, I—okay, I know how this looks but it wasn't—I didn't mean to tell him, it just kinda... slipped out? We were talking about Pride and he mentioned something about allies and I just—fuck, I'm so sorry.
443 No no no, that came out wrong. I mean—it's not like I was gossiping or anything, we were having this whole conversation about representation and I got caught up and [nervous laugh] honestly I forgot it wasn't my thing to share, which is so stupid, I know.
444 I've been feeling sick about it all day. Like literally—I tried to text you but I couldn't figure out what to say because there's no good excuse, y'know? I just... I fucked up. I really, really fucked up.
445 I know. God, I know and that's the worst part. You trusted me with something huge and I just—I blew it. [sigh] I'm usually so good at keeping secrets, I swear, but I got comfortable and stupid and I wasn't thinking about how this was yours to tell, not mine.
446 Wait, what? No no no, that's not—okay when I talked to him after, he seemed totally cool with it. Like he was actually really supportive? Maybe he's just... processing? Or maybe he doesn't know how to bring it up? I dunno, I'm trying to—sorry, I'm not helping.
447 Um, yeah? I mean—I realized what I'd done like immediately and I kinda panicked so I told him not to say anything to you because it wasn't my place to share and to just—to pretend he didn't know? But obviously that's not... that didn't work.
448 Fuck. Yeah, that's—that's actually worse, isn't it? I was trying to fix it but I just made everything more awkward. Classic me, right? Always making things worse when I'm trying to help.
449 You're right. You're totally right, I'm sorry. I'm making this about me when you're the one who—when I violated your trust and took away your choice about when and how to come out to him. That's... that's really shitty of me. The whole thing, I mean.
450 Is there anything I can do? Like, genuinely asking here because I wanna make this right but I don't—I don't wanna make it worse again, y'know? Should I talk to Marcus? Should I not talk to Marcus? [groan] I just... tell me what you need from me.
451 That's... yeah, that's fair. More than fair, honestly. I promise—I know my promises probably don't mean much right now but I swear I'm gonna work on that. On keeping my mouth shut when it's not my story to tell. I'm really, really sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything but... I am.
452 Wait wait wait—you got the dog? The actual dog you've been talking about for like, literally years? Oh my god, I'm gonna cry. When did this happen?
453 Mabel! That's—okay that's literally the cutest name I've ever heard. Is she like, is she the rescue you were looking at? The one with the—um, the floppy ears?
454 She chose you? [Gasp] Stop it, that's so—I mean, that's exactly how it's supposed to happen, right? Like the universe just... knows. Tell me everything about her.
455 Oh no no no, baby girl! That's—honestly though? That's kinda heartbreaking but also really sweet that she trusts you already. How's she doing with like, settling in and stuff?
456 Are you kidding me right now? That's—she already loves you so much. I'm literally gonna [Laugh] —sorry, I'm just so happy for you. You've wanted this for so long.
457 Yeah, I mean—I totally get that. It's like, suddenly you're responsible for this whole other life, y'know? But honestly? You're gonna be such a good dog parent. You're like, the most reliable person I know.
458 Just the left— [Chuckle] okay that's actually hilarious. Did she like, completely destroy it or just kinda nibble?
459 Oh my god, she's already got personality! That's—wait, were they expensive shoes? Please tell me they weren't the ones you just bought.
460 Noooo! Okay okay, but like—you're not even mad, are you? I can tell. You're totally already in love with this disaster dog.
461 Stop—she sighs? Like a little person? That's it, I'm coming over immediately. I need to meet this perfect angel baby who destroys shoes and sighs about it.
462 Oh god, oh no—wait, I didn't mean to! I thought you'd already watched it! Everyone's been talking about it for like two weeks and I just assumed—
463 I know, I know, but that was—that was like a month ago! And you're always binging stuff so fast, y'know? Like remember when you watched all of Succession in literally four days? [nervous laugh] I just figured...
464 Yeah. Yeah, I did. God, I'm so sorry. I literally just—I got so excited talking about it and the words just came out before I could stop myself. You know how I get when I'm really into something.
465 Oh no. Oh no no no, that makes it so much worse. I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. Like, I can't believe I did that to you. [groan] I honestly wanna crawl into a hole right now.
466 I know! And I—okay, there's no excuse. None. But I swear I wasn't thinking, which I know sounds terrible but my brain just completely forgot and—ugh, that's not helping, is it?
467 Right. Of course not. Um, can I—would it help if I watched it with you anyway? Like we could still experience it together? I mean, I know it's not the same, but maybe I could point out stuff you might've missed or—actually, that's probably making it worse.
468 Because there's—there's still so much you don't know! Like how it happens and all the stuff leading up to it. The journey's still worth it, right? [sigh] Okay, I'm grasping at straws here, I know.
469 I do. I do know that, and that's what makes me feel even more terrible. Like, you've had such a rough month and this was your escape thing and I just—I ruined it. I completely ruined it for you.
470 Is there—is there anything I can do? Like, literally anything? I'll watch whatever terrible reality show you want for the next month, or I could—I dunno, ban myself from talking about TV shows ever again?
471 [nervous laugh] Okay, fair. That's... that's actually fair. But seriously, I'm gonna be so much more careful from now on. Like, I'm gonna ask three times before I say anything about any show ever. I promise. I really am sorry.
472 SCENARIO: waiting for water to boil
473 [shaking voice] Oh my God, oh my God, it's here—the email is here! [getting faster] I can't click it, my hands are literally trembling. [Sharp inhale] What if we failed? What if all those months of studying meant nothing?
474 [whispered panic] Wait, I need water first. [louder] No, forget water—I need oxygen! [Hyperventilating] One... two... I can't do this. You go first and tell me if yours is good news, then I'll know there's hope for mine.
475 [screaming] I PASSED! [sobbing] Oh my God, I actually passed! [more quietly] Three years of law school, six months of bar prep, and it's finally over. Look at my name on that pass list—it's really there!
476 [through tears] My mom is going to lose her mind. [sniffling] She already bought a frame for the certificate. [Giggling uncontrollably] Should we call everyone now or wait until we stop shaking? I can barely hold my phone steady.
477 [calming down] I literally thought I failed after the essays. [laughing] Contracts destroyed me. [Deep exhale] But somehow, some way, we made it through. We're going to be the best lawyers this city has ever seen.
478 [determined] First, we're framing these results. [excitedly building] Then we're getting those business cards printed immediately! [Squealing] Can you believe we can actually put "Attorney at Law" after our names now? This feels like a dream.
479 [nostalgic tone] All those flashcards, practice exams, outline sessions. [getting louder] Every sacrifice was worth this exact moment! [Contented sigh] My student loans suddenly feel less crushing knowing I can actually practice law now.
480 [quietly intense] Promise me something right now. [more firmly] We'll never forget how this feels—this pure joy, this relief. [Shaky breath] When we're stressed at our firms, we'll remember we conquered the bar exam together.
481 [mischievously] Update it now! [dramatically] Let everyone see it at 3 PM on a Tuesday! [Snorting laugh] "Pleased to announce I passed the bar exam" sounds so professional when inside I'm literally screaming with joy.
482 [winding down] My adrenaline is finally dropping. [peaceful] This morning feels like a year ago. [Soft chuckle] We woke up as nervous wrecks and now we're going to sleep as lawyers. What a plot twist.
483 [concerned] Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear about this situation, let me pull up your reservation immediately. [apologetically] Can you please confirm your last name and confirmation number? [reassuring] We take these matters very seriously and I'll get our manager involved right away.
484 [sympathetically] Mr. Henderson, I completely understand your frustration, this is truly awful. [more urgently] I'm immediately moving you to our premium suite 812, and we'll have housekeeping collect your belongings for professional treatment. [sincerely] Would you like us to arrange medical attention for those bites?
485 [calmly] Sir, I'm authorizing a complete refund to your card ending in 4892. [professionally] Additionally, we'll cover dry cleaning and replacement costs up to $1,500 with proper receipts. [more softly] Our general manager, Ms. Rodriguez, will personally meet you in fifteen minutes to discuss further compensation.
486 [firmly] We've already initiated our emergency protocol and pest control arrives at 6 AM. [reassuringly] All adjacent rooms are being inspected and relocated as we speak—that's twelve rooms total. [apologetic] I know this doesn't undo your experience, but we're treating this as our highest priority incident.
487 [steadily] Absolutely, I'm documenting everything in incident report TX-20241122-BUG-347. [helpfully] Corporate's complaint line is 1-800-555-8200, case reference number will be HC8829M. [more warmly] I'm also personally ensuring you receive email confirmation within ten minutes to JHenderson at gmail dot com, correct?
488 [apologetically] I understand your frustration completely, and I'm so sorry about the delay. [quickly] Our maintenance team has been overwhelmed with, uh, emergency repairs, but [more reassuringly] I'll escalate this to priority status right now.
489 [briskly] You're absolutely right, this isn't acceptable at all. [more firmly] Let me check the system... okay, I see the work orders were never properly assigned. [quickly] I'm personally scheduling someone for tomorrow morning, guaranteed.
490 [earnestly] I completely understand why you don't trust us right now. [speaking faster] Here's what I'll do—I'm sending you the technician's direct number, and [more confidently] if they don't show by noon, I'll authorize a rent reduction.
491 [quickly] The mold issue, yes, I see those reports here too. [professionally] Since we're already sending maintenance tomorrow, I'll—I'll make sure they assess both problems. [reassuringly] One visit, both issues addressed, no more runaround.
492 [efficiently] Absolutely, I'm drafting the email right now as we speak. [rapidly] You'll have it within ten minutes with all details, my supervisor's signature, and [more slowly] our sincere apologies for this unacceptable situation.
493 [chuckles softly] Actually, I'm the regional manager filling in today. [seriously] These complaints reached my desk this morning, and honestly, [disappointed] I'm not happy with how my team handled this.
494 [confidently] Not only will it happen, but I'll be there personally to ensure everything's done right. [briskly] Eight AM sharp, both repairs, plus [more warmly] I'm bringing space heaters for tonight.
495 [sympathetically] As a parent myself, I completely understand that frustration. [quickly] The heaters will arrive within two hours, and [firmly] this won't happen again on my watch, I promise.
496 [decisively] You're right to ask about long-term solutions. [rapidly] We're implementing a new maintenance response system, quarterly unit inspections, and [more deliberately] a direct hotline to my office for urgent issues.
497 [urgently] Please don't make any decisions until after tomorrow's repairs. [earnestly] We value you as a tenant, and I think—no, I know—we can restore your confidence. [warmly] See you at eight AM sharp.
498 [Angry] No, no, no, you can't die on me right now—I don't even know where I'm supposed to—[Groan] this is literally the worst timing ever!
499 [Sarcastic] Oh perfect, just absolutely perfect timing, phone. [Tsk] Really outdid yourself today, didn't you?
500 [Fast] Wait, did I—did I save the address somewhere else? [Disappointed] I think it was only in the text and now I'm completely lost.
501 [Whisper] Please, please, please just give me one percent battery, that's all I need. [Slow] Come on, just turn on for like thirty seconds.
502 [Happy] You know what? [Laugh] This is actually—this is kinda freeing, being completely disconnected for once.
503 [Sad] I was, um, I was right in the middle of saying goodbye to her and it just—[Sigh] she probably thinks I hung up on purpose.
504 [Shout] Does anyone have a charger? [Fast] iPhone charger, anyone? I'll pay you twenty bucks!
505 [Disappointed] Three interviews lined up today and I can't, uh, can't even remember which building was first. [Tsk] Should've written it down old school, I guess.
506 [Slow] So let me get this straight—the GPS is dead, the emergency contacts are dead, and basically I'm just... [Chuckle] totally stranded here.
507 [Angry] I literally just charged this thing! [Fast] How is it already—what is even draining the battery this fast?
508 [Sarcastic] Sure, die right when the Uber's arriving, that's—[Laugh] that's really helpful, thanks so much for your service today.
509 [Whisper] Okay, okay, don't panic, um, there's gotta be a payphone around here somewhere, right? [Sad] Do those even exist anymore?
510 [Happy] Twenty-three percent! [Shout] It's back on! Quick, screenshot everything before it dies again!
511 [Disappointed] I mean, I knew the battery was getting bad, but—[Slow] dying during my kid's first recital video is just... yeah.
512 [Fast] The boarding pass, the boarding pass was digital and now—[Groan] they're gonna close the gate and I can't even prove I have a ticket!
513 [Sarcastic] Honestly, what did people even do before phones? [Chuckle] Oh right, they actually remembered things and carried maps.
514 [Angry] This stupid update yesterday must've—I dunno, it must've broken something because this is not normal! [Tsk] [Disappointed] Seven hundred dollar brick now.
515 [Whisper] If I just hold the power button and the, um, the volume button together maybe—[Sigh] nope, nothing, completely dead.
516 [Happy] Wait, is that—is that a charging station over there? [Fast] Oh my god, yes, yes, yes, there's actually an open port!
517 [Slow] You know what the worst part is? [Sad] I was finally winning that game after like—after three hours of trying and now it's all gone.
518 SCENARIO: Offhandedly recounting a time they interrupted someone, then counting how many times they did it, then realizing they dominated the entire conversation, spiraling into conversational bulldozing guilt
519 Oh god, okay—that's... um, that's fair. That's totally fair. I know I've been—wait, actually let me think... [nervous laugh] Wow, it's been a while hasn't it?
520 No no no, that's not—okay yeah, I did need the car but I also wanted to see you! I mean, I always wanna see you, it's just that lately I've been so crazy with work and—that sounds like an excuse. Sorry.
521 I don't—nothing! I mean, okay, yes, I was gonna ask about your printer but that's not why I—ugh, this looks so bad. I literally just realized how this looks and I feel like such a jerk right now.
522 I'm sorry. I really am. Like, you're one of my best friends and I've been treating you like some kind of... I dunno, like a convenience store or something? That's—that's awful. [sigh] I didn't even realize I was doing it.
523 I know, I know! It's just—everything's been so chaotic and when something comes up I think "oh, Sam will help" and I call, but I don't call when things are good because I'm just... I guess I assume you know we're good? But that's stupid. That's really stupid.
524 You have every right to be mad. Honestly, I'd be furious if someone did this to me. Wait—has it really been every single time? Like every call?
525 No, I—actually yeah, maybe. Hit me with it. I deserve to hear it because clearly I've been completely oblivious and—god, I'm that friend aren't I? The one everyone complains about. [groan]
526 Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm the worst. Like actually the worst person. I can't believe—no wonder you're mad. I wouldn't even pick up the phone if I were you.
527 I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better. I mean it. Starting right now, no more asking for stuff. And I wanna actually hang out, like for real, just because. Would you maybe wanna get coffee this week? My treat, obviously.
528 Okay I deserved that. [nervous laugh] But no, I'll pick YOU up. And we're going wherever you wanna go, and I'm not asking for a single thing except maybe your forgiveness? Eventually? When you're ready, I mean. No pressure.
529 Wait wait wait—what? You got—okay, that's huge! Like, that's actually huge! Which conference? Tell me everything right now.
530 TechConnect? Are you—that's like, the conference, right? The one with all the, um, all the big names? [Gasp] Oh my god, how are you so calm about this?
531 Okay okay, yeah, no that's—that's totally normal. I'd be freaking out too. But like, they picked you for a reason, y'know? What're you gonna talk about?
532 The one you basically lived at the office for? That—honestly that makes so much sense. People need to hear about that. It was kinda groundbreaking, wasn't it?
533 Um, excuse me? You literally— [Laugh] okay no, you can't downplay this. Three patents? That's not nothing, babe.
534 Five hun—okay wow. That's... yeah, that's a lot of people. But like, here's the thing though—you explain complex stuff to me all the time and I actually get it, so...
535 I mean, kinda? But also like—wait, have you done any public speaking before? Even like, smaller stuff?
536 Okay okay, so we're gonna—actually, you know what? My cousin does speaking coach stuff. Super chill, not weird about it. Want me to, um, want me to connect you? [Sigh] Sorry, I'm being pushy.
537 Really? Oh good, 'cause honestly I was gonna suggest it anyway. You're gonna be—you're gonna be amazing though. Like, once you get up there and start talking about your work? You light up.
538 You totally do! It's like—okay you don't see it, but when you explain that algorithm stuff? You get this whole... thing. It's actually really cute. Anyway, when do you have to confirm?
539 I—yeah, I did. I mean, everyone kinda knew? But that's not—wait, that came out wrong. I should've called, I know I should've called.
540 Three weeks, I know, I know. God, I'm such a terrible friend. I kept meaning to reach out but then I'd be like "what if they need space" and then—[nervous laugh] that sounds so stupid now, doesn't it?
541 No no no, that's not—I wasn't avoiding you, I swear. I literally typed out like fifteen different texts but none of them felt right? Like, what do you even say when someone's whole life is falling apart, y'know?
542 You're right. You're absolutely right. I just—I overthought it so much that I ended up doing nothing which is like, literally the worst thing I could've done. [Sigh] I'm so sorry.
543 I know, and honestly? I have no excuse. I just—I got in my own head about it and then the longer I waited the weirder it felt to suddenly reach out and—god, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Making excuses.
544 Okay, let me just—let me be real with you for a second. I was scared. My parents' divorce was so ugly and I didn't—I didn't wanna say the wrong thing and make it worse for you.
545 Which was worse, I get that now. I really—[groan] I really fucked up. You needed me and I wasn't there. That's on me, completely on me.
546 I know. And I—shit, I'm gonna cry now. I should've been there. Should've just shown up with ice cream or something, y'know? Like a normal friend would.
547 Is it—is it too late? I mean, I could grab some right now if you want? Ben & Jerry's is still open and I know you like that brownie one, unless—unless you need me to just go?
548 Of course I do. Half Baked, always Half Baked. Look, I know I messed up but I—I really wanna fix this. If you'll let me? Please?
549 Wait wait wait—you WHAT? You defended? Like, the actual final defense defense? And you're just—you're just casually mentioning this now?
550 Oh my god. Oh my— [Gasp] holy shit, you're a doctor! You're literally Dr.—I mean, that's insane! How do you feel? Are you like, totally exhausted or—?
551 Yeah no, that's—honestly that makes total sense. Like, you've been working toward this for what, six years? Seven? It's gotta be so weird to just suddenly... be done, y'know?
552 Seven and a— [Laugh] okay, you were definitely counting. But like, I don't blame you at all. God, I remember when you started and you were all nervous about whether you'd even make it through the first year.
553 Right? Right? Like, you've basically—I mean, you've completely transformed. The stuff you talk about now, it's like... I don't understand half of it but it sounds incredibly smart.
554 Okay okay, fair point. But I—I tried! Remember when you were explaining your thesis and I kept asking about the—wait, what was it? The enzyme thing? And you just looked at me like I was hopeless.
555 Rude! But probably—probably true. [Chuckle] So what happens now? Like, do you just... leave? Start applying for fancy professor jobs?
556 Of course you do, you overachiever. Where—actually, wait, is it gonna be here or are you gonna have to move? Please don't—please tell me you're not leaving.
557 Oh thank god, I was about to—honestly I was gonna cry. But um, can we just... can we take a second to appreciate what you just did? Because this is huge. Like, monumentally huge.
558 No no no, don't—don't you dare minimize this. You literally just achieved something that like, what, two percent of people do? You're a doctor! We're gonna celebrate whether you like it or not, okay?
559 Okay, so? I mean—what's wrong with being friendly? He's in our psych class, we were just talking about the midterm.
560 I don't—look, hate is a strong word. I'm not his biggest fan, sure, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be rude to him. That's just basic human decency, y'know?
561 It's not—[scoff] okay, fine, maybe I'm not being my most authentic self or whatever, but like, what do you want me to do? Tell him to his face that he's annoying? That's not who I am.
562 That's—wow, that's really unfair. Everyone vents about people sometimes. You literally complained about your lab partner for twenty minutes yesterday, but I bet you still said "great job" when she finished her part.
563 How? How is that different? Because—because I'm actually trying not to hurt people's feelings? [frustrated laugh] Like, I'm sorry I don't go around being brutally honest to everyone I meet.
564 I'm not—ugh, I'm not two different people. I'm just... polite. There's a difference between being fake and having basic social skills. Not everyone needs to know every single thought in my head.
565 Are you serious right now? You—you get the real me, obviously. That's why I can actually tell you how I feel about people. That's what friends do. Or at least, I thought that's what we did.
566 Okay okay, that's—[sigh] that actually hurts. Like, if you really think I'm fake with you after everything, then I dunno what to tell you. Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
567 Fine. You know what? Fine. I'm—I'm trying to navigate the world without being an asshole to people, and somehow that makes me the bad guy here. Sorry I'm not mean enough for you, I guess.
568 Then what? What are you saying? Because honestly, it sounds like you want me to just—to be cruel to people I don't like, and that's not... that's not gonna happen. I'd rather be "fake nice" than needlessly mean.
569 SCENARIO: realizing they wore the wrong shoes for the weather
570 [trembling] Is that—is that really happening? [louder] The lock just clicked! [Sobbing laugh] After three years in this hellhole, the door is actually opening. I can't feel my legs. Someone pinch me right now!
571 [hysterical laughter] Remember when we counted every single brick? [quieter] Two thousand forty-seven. [building excitement] Now we'll never see them again! I'm going to eat real food, sleep in a real bed, see my daughter!
572 [firmly] Stop that thinking. [gentler] We survived this together, remember? [Choking up] You kept me sane when the darkness came. Your family never stopped loving you. They're waiting, I promise you they're still waiting.
573 [booming joy] Fresh air! [softer wonder] Can you smell that? [Delighted squeal] It's grass and rain and life! I forgot the world had colors like this. Blue sky, green trees, everything's so impossibly bright!
574 [urgently] There's a car waiting. [suspicious] Why are they helping us? [Nervous laugh] Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe we just get in and figure out the rest later. What else can they take from us now?
575 [dreamily] Tonight I'll see stars. [more intensely] Real stars, not imagined ones. [Giddy giggle] I used to draw constellations on the ceiling with my fingernail. Now I'll lie on actual grass and count them properly.
576 [reverently] The door's closing behind us. [celebratory shout] It's closing! [breathless] We're on the outside of it now. All those nights we dreamed this exact moment, and it's even better than we imagined it would be.
577 [rushed words] Quick, memorize everything! [slowing down] The guard's face, the doorway, this exact second. [Fierce whisper] We earned this moment with blood and patience. No one can ever take this memory from us.
578 [determined] We walk out together. [emotional] Same as we survived—together. [Sharp exhale] Leave all the darkness in there. From this second forward, we're different men. We're survivors. We're free. We're magnificently, impossibly free!
579 [nostalgic already] Will you miss anything? [quickly] No, stupid question. [Thoughtful pause] Maybe just knowing you were there, through the wall. But now we can be friends in the light. That's infinitely better, right?
580 [apologetically] Good morning Mr. Henderson, yes, this is Dr. Martinez from Valley Sleep Center. [more gently] I know it's early, but you requested the first available slot for your results discussion. [reassuring] Should I call back later?
581 [professionally] That's correct, VSC-4829-B. [in a measured tone] So, during your overnight study at our facility on 2847 Riverside Drive, we recorded some interesting patterns. [carefully] You experienced 47 apnea episodes per hour.
582 [calmly] It's definitely in the severe range, yes. [more encouragingly] But here's the good news—your oxygen levels only dropped below 88% about twelve times. [optimistic] That's actually better than most severe cases we see.
583 [matter-of-factly] A CPAP device would be the recommended treatment, yes. [reassuring] Your insurance pre-authorization code RX-9982-CPAP has already been approved. [more enthusiastically] Most patients see improvement within just 3-4 nights of use.
584 [helpfully] You can come to our equipment center at 1420 Medical Plaza, Suite 200-A, anytime after 2 PM today. [more quietly] Your copay will be $127.50. [brightly] We'll also schedule a follow-up in two weeks.
585 [chuckling softly] Just bring forms 3-A and 7-B, plus your insurance card. [patiently] The others are optional questionnaires. [more seriously] Oh, and avoid eating a heavy meal before your fitting appointment.
586 [sympathetically] Many partners notice the symptoms first, actually. [encouragingly] She'll probably sleep better once you start treatment too. [gently] About 73% of our patients report their relationships improve significantly.
587 [patiently] Anytime after 2 PM at 1420 Medical Plaza, Suite 200-A. [helpfully] We're open until 6:30 PM. [more firmly] Just remember to call if you can't make it today—the confirmation number is APT-8847.
588 [efficiently] It's tentatively scheduled for November 15th at 3:30 PM. [accommodating] But we can definitely reschedule if needed. [warmly] Just give us 48 hours notice using your patient portal access code MED-2290.
589 [laughing gently] At least now you know why you need that coffee so badly! [optimistically] You'll be amazed how much more energy you'll have once treatment starts. [professionally] Have a great day, Mr. Henderson, and we'll see you this afternoon.
590 [apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir. [quickly] Let me pull up your work order right now—uh, what was your apartment number again? [more reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out immediately.
591 [briskly] Right, I see the issue here—our plumber had emergencies at other properties. [more quickly] But listen, I can guarantee someone tomorrow morning, [firmly] first appointment at 8 AM sharp.
592 [defensively] Sir, we absolutely track everything in our system. [speaking rapidly] Sometimes emergencies happen—burst pipes, flooding—those take priority. [more calmly] But your sink repair is marked urgent now.
593 [quickly] I'm authorizing overtime pay for our weekend crew. [more emphatically] Someone will be there tomorrow, no excuses. [reassuringly] Plus, I'm adding a rent credit for your troubles—how's fifty dollars sound?
594 [professionally] Completely understood, and that won't be necessary. [speaking fast] I'm personally putting this in our priority log, texting the plumber now. [confidently] Eight AM tomorrow, apartment 4B, sink repair.
595 [quickly] That would be Marcus, our senior technician. [more assuringly] He'll have all necessary parts in his truck—washers, pipes, the works. [briskly] No repeat of last time, I promise.
596 [hastily] Different Marcus, different crew entirely. [speaking rapidly] This one's been with us fifteen years, five-star reviews across the board. [more slowly] Your neighbor's issue is... being addressed separately.
597 [earnestly] It will happen, you have my word. [quickly] I'm emailing you confirmation right now with Marcus's direct number. [professionally] Is 4B still the best contact number for you?
598 [rapidly] Kitchen sink, got it, highlighting that now in big bold letters. [more carefully] Marcus will also call you thirty minutes before arrival. [reassuringly] We're going to fix this properly.
599 [briskly] Nothing else needed, everything's set on our end. [speaking quickly] Tomorrow, 8 AM, Marcus will fix your kitchen sink. [more warmly] Thank you for your patience, and sorry for all the delays.
600 [Sad] Oh sweetie, I know, I know it hurts—but um, you know what? [Soft] We're gonna put a special bandaid on it, okay?
601 [Fast] Hey, hey, hey, look at me—watch this! [Happy] I can make my face do the silliest thing ever! [Laugh]
602 [Whisper] You wanna know a secret? [Slow] Sometimes... even grown-ups cry when they're scared too.
603 [Disappointed] I get it, buddy, I really—ugh, losing your favorite toy is just the worst. [Sigh]
604 [Happy] Oh my gosh, are those—are those dragon tears? [Chuckle] Those are super powerful, you know!
605 [Angry] That was NOT okay what they did to you, and I'm gonna—well, we're gonna fix this together, alright? [Tsk]
606 [Slow] Let's just... breathe for a second, okay? [Sigh] In through your nose, and out through your—that's it.
607 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, crying forever sounds like a great plan. [Chuckle] But maybe we could try ice cream first?
608 [Fast] Quick, quick—tell me five things you can see right now! [Happy] It's a game, come on!
609 [Sad] Your goldfish was, um—he was really special, wasn't he? [Slow] And it's okay to miss him lots.
610 [Shout] FREEZE! [Fast] Did you hear that? I think—I think your giggle monster is trying to escape! [Laugh]
611 [Whisper] C'mere, little one. [Sad] Sometimes a hug is all we need, y'know?
612 [Disappointed] Yeah, I'd be upset too if I couldn't—wait, actually, what if we built an even BIGGER fort? [Happy]
613 [Slow] The scary dream's all gone now, see? [Whisper] It can't get you when I'm here.
614 [Sarcastic] Well obviously the world is ending because we're out of chocolate milk. [Tsk] [Fast] But guess what I found in the back of the fridge?
615 [Angry] Those mean kids don't know what they're—ugh, you're literally the coolest kid I know! [Groan] They're just jealous!
616 [Happy] Remember when you were brave at the doctor's yesterday? [Slow] You're being just as brave right now, I can tell.
617 [Fast] Okay so, um, what if we just—actually, you know what? [Shout] Let's have a crying contest! Whoever cries loudest wins!
618 [Disappointed] I wish I could make it all better right—like, instantly, but... [Sigh] [Soft] Sometimes feeling sad is part of getting better.
619 [Whisper] You feel all those big feelings in your tummy? [Happy] That just means your heart is extra special and full of love. [Chuckle]
620 SCENARIO: Mad about a long hold time, then the agent resolving everything in minutes
621 Oh god, okay—I know I was kinda loud at dinner. Was I too loud? I was probably too loud. Sometimes I just get excited and I don't realize how much I'm—y'know, taking over the conversation.
622 Wait wait wait, what do you mean? Like, other times too? I mean—okay, I guess I do talk a lot sometimes but I thought everyone was having fun? [nervous laugh] Were people not having fun?
623 I know! I know it was, and I—oh my god, did I make it about me? I didn't mean to make it about me. I was just trying to keep things lively and then that story about my promotion kinda just—it just came out.
624 Twenty min—was it really that long? Shit. Shit, I'm so sorry. I honestly didn't realize I was doing it again. It's like—I dunno, I get nervous when there's silence and then I just start filling it with whatever comes to mind.
625 That's—[sigh] that's fair. That's totally fair. I can see how that would be really frustrating. Like, really really frustrating. I'm not trying to be the center of attention, I swear, it just sorta... happens?
626 Okay, ouch. But—no, you're right. You're absolutely right. I've been a terrible friend, haven't I? God, I must've ruined so many nights out and nobody ever said anything and now I feel like such an ass.
627 I get that. I really do. My therapist actually—sorry, see? I'm doing it right now, making it about me again. I'm gonna work on this, okay? Like genuinely work on it. Maybe I should just... talk less? Is that what you need from me?
628 Yeah, no no no, that makes sense. That's—that's totally reasonable. I can do that. I will do that. [groan] Jamie probably hates me now, don't they? I basically hijacked their entire birthday dinner with my stupid work drama.
629 Oh I'm gonna. I'm gonna text them right now—actually, no, that's better in person, right? I'll take them to lunch or something. Their choice of restaurant, and I promise I'll literally just—I'll just listen. I can listen. I'm capable of listening.
630 Count to three. I can do that. I mean, it sounds simple but honestly that's—that's actually really good advice. Thank you for telling me this stuff. I know it wasn't easy and I'm just... I'm really sorry I've been so oblivious about it.
631 Oh come on, it was just—we joke about stuff like that all the time. You literally made fun of my hairline last week and I didn't get all weird about it.
632 How? How is that different? Because—okay, no, seriously, explain to me how that's different. We've been roasting each other for like three years and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
633 I—shit. [sigh] Okay, I didn't think about it like that, but also you never told me it was that serious. Like, I'm supposed to just magically know where the line is?
634 That's not—that's not fair. I do know you, which is why I thought we were past all the, y'know, the walking on eggshells thing. I thought we could just be ourselves.
635 Humiliating? Come on, that's—you're being dramatic. It was one joke, and honestly, everyone laughed because they thought we were doing our usual thing, not because they were actually [frustrated laugh] judging your teeth or whatever.
636 Don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down on me. Look look, I'm sorry it hurt you, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I'm some—some bully when we literally do this all the time.
637 We kinda do though? Like, remember when you told everyone about my thing with crying during Pixar movies? That was—that was actually embarrassing, but I got over it because that's what friends do.
638 To you maybe. But I—whatever, fine fine, I get it. Your thing is different, more important, more whatever. But you gotta understand I wasn't trying to hurt you. I just thought we were close enough that nothing was off limits.
639 Wow. Okay. So three years of friendship and one bad joke means we're not close? That's—[scoff] you know what, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't know you as well as I thought.
640 Yeah, me too. Because honestly? I'm disappointed that instead of just telling me I crossed a line, you're gonna blow up our whole friendship over something I didn't even—something I would've apologized for if you'd just talked to me like an actual friend.
641 SCENARIO: waiting in a long checkout line that isn't moving
642 [bitter laugh] See this beauty across my ribs? [tracing motion] Six inches of Damascus steel, courtesy of our handler's "miscalculated extraction." [darkly amused] They sent me in blind, then forgot to mention the guards had night vision.
643 [sarcastically sweet] How thoughtful of them. [Hollow laugh] Remember Marseille? [voice dropping] They injected me with expired truth serum, left me seizing for hours before realizing their mistake.
644 [whistling exhale] Jesus. [quieter] Though I suppose my missing molar has character now. [building anger] They yanked it out with pliers because the cyanide capsule "needed to look realistic" for the Mumbai job.
645 [mock cheerful] Building character, their favorite excuse. [Harsh whisper] Notice how I can't fully close my left eye? [louder] Nerve damage from their experimental combat drug that was "definitely tested and safe."
646 [exhausted tone] Sometimes I count them at night. [more quietly] Seventeen scars, nine fractures, four concussions. [Dark chuckle] My medical file reads like a horror novel ghost-written by bureaucrats.
647 [philosophical] Stockholm syndrome with dental benefits and a pension. [rueful laugh] Although the pension assumes we live long enough. [trailing off] What's the current life expectancy for our department—thirty-eight?
648 [suddenly bright] Speaking of vacation, remember Bali? [voice hardening] When they used me as bait without telling me? [Sarcastic laugh] Nothing says "trust your agency" like discovering you're the honeypot mid-operation.
649 [weary] The chips were almost quaint compared to the psychological conditioning. [Shaky breath] Six months of controlled trauma to "optimize performance." [flatly] I still can't hear Beethoven without vomiting.
650 [nostalgic poison] Remember when we thought this job would be glamorous? [building frustration] Martinis and tuxedos, not blood tests and burn units. [Hysterical giggle] God, we were such beautiful idiots back then.
651 [deadpan] Too valuable or too expensive to replace? [Tired sigh] Training new recruits costs more than keeping us barely functional. [sardonically] We're like vintage cars—cheaper to repair than buy new.
652 [professionally] Good afternoon, I'd be happy to help you with your SmartTemp device. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account—could you provide your serial number? [more clearly] It should be on the back panel, starting with ST3.
653 [typing sounds] Perfect, I see your device here, registered to 1847 Maple Drive. [concerned] Now, when you say 82 degrees—is this happening, um, consistently at 3 AM? [curiously] Have you recently updated the firmware or changed any scheduling settings?
654 [thoughtfully] Interesting, so this started specifically on October 15th. [professionally] Let me check something—are you by chance enrolled in our EcoSmart energy program? [more slowly] Sometimes utility companies can remotely adjust temperatures during their, uh, peak management periods.
655 [apologetically] Well, not exactly cooking you, but yes, they can make adjustments. [reassuring tone] The good news is we can easily opt you out—just need to verify your account PIN. [clearly] That's the four-digit code you created during registration.
656 [cheerfully] Perfect, that worked! I've successfully removed you from the EcoSmart program. [helpfully] Your thermostat should now follow only your personal schedule. [more seriously] Is there anything else I can help you with today, maybe setting up a custom comfort schedule?
657 [briskly] Good afternoon, Riverside Events, this is Claire speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you with your upcoming event today?
658 [reassuring] Okay, let's take this step by step. [professionally] Which date is your event and, um, what specific restrictions are you concerned about?
659 [calmly] Right, so for March fifteenth, we're actually at full capacity allowance now. [more cheerfully] The noise ordinance only affects outdoor spaces after ten PM, which shouldn't impact your ballroom reservation.
660 [quickly] The band is fine until ten, but honestly, most couples move entertainment inside by eight anyway. [helpfully] We can absolutely coordinate that transition for you.
661 [firmly] No changes to catering whatsoever—that's probably old information floating around. [more briskly] Your seven-course menu is locked in and the kitchen is fully operational.
662 [sympathetically] Yeah, the city's doing construction on the north lot, which—I won't lie—reduces our spaces by about forty. [optimistically] But we're offering free valet service for all March events.
663 [warmly] Absolutely, our valet team is trained for accessibility needs. [professionally faster] They'll have golf carts ready for anyone who needs assistance from the parking area.
664 [chuckles softly] Trust me, you're not the first bride to call in a panic. [reassuringly] We've handled over two hundred events this year without any major hiccups.
665 [efficiently] I'll email you everything we discussed, plus our updated guidelines document. [helpfully] That way you both have it in writing—less stress for everyone.
666 [briskly] No restrictions on photography or videography anywhere on the property. [more slowly] Just have them check in at the front desk for their vendor passes.
667 [Fast] Okay so, um, that was—that wasn't supposed to happen like that, obviously. [Nervous laugh] [Sigh] Just gonna pretend the last five minutes didn't exist.
668 [Whisper] Is everyone still looking at me or can I, like, come out from behind this plant now? [Tsk]
669 [Sarcastic] Well, that went great. [Slow] Really nailed it. [Groan]
670 [Happy] You know what? [Laugh] At least I'll have a funny story for later, right?
671 [Angry] I specifically practiced so this wouldn't—ugh, whatever. [Fast] Let's just move on, please.
672 [Sad] I kinda wanna disappear into the floor right now, if that's, um, if that's possible. [Sigh]
673 [Shout] IT'S FINE! [Fast] [Nervous laugh] Everything's fine, I'm fine, we're all fine here!
674 [Disappointed] I had one job—literally one job—and I managed to mess it up. [Tsk] [Slow] Classic me, honestly.
675 [Whisper] [Fast] Did my face just turn red? It feels red. Oh god, it's definitely red.
676 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's all just stand here in silence and really, y'know, savor this moment. [Groan]
677 [Happy] Actually, that could've gone way worse—I mean, remember when Steve did that thing with the—yeah. [Chuckle]
678 [Fast] Can we just, like, rewind and I'll try that again without the whole—without doing whatever that was? [Sigh] [Disappointed] No?
679 [Angry] [Shout] NOBODY SAW THAT! [Fast] And if you did, you're gonna forget it immediately, got it?
680 [Slow] So, um, moving forward, we're never gonna talk about this again, right? [Whisper] Please say right.
681 [Sad] [Slow] I practiced this a hundred times and then my brain just... went completely blank. [Tsk]
682 [Chuckle] Well, at least I didn't, uh—actually no, that was pretty much the worst thing I could've done. [Groan]
683 [Fast] [Happy] Hey, remember that time you fell off the stage? This is nothing compared to—okay, not helping? [Nervous laugh]
684 [Disappointed] Twenty years from now I'm still gonna randomly remember this at 3 AM and just—ugh. [Sigh] [Slow] Why am I like this?
685 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh good, my mom's filming this, so we can relive it forever and ever. [Tsk] Fantastic.
686 [Whisper] I'm just gonna, um, go to the bathroom for like—I dunno, maybe three hours? [Slow] [Sad] That seems reasonable.
687 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a long wait at the doctor, then the doctor spends extra time really listening
688 Wait wait wait—what? You won? Oh my god, are you serious? That's—that's incredible! I mean, I knew you were gonna do well but like, winning? [Gasp] That's huge!
689 Weird? No no no, not weird—amazing! You literally just... okay, tell me everything. What was it like up there? Were you nervous or—actually, scratch that, you probably weren't even nervous, were you?
690 Oh babe, no—but you still went up? That's like, that's actually so brave though. I would've just gone home, honestly. What poem did you do?
691 The—oh. Oh wow. That one always makes me kinda... [Sigh] yeah. That one's heavy. And they loved it, obviously. I mean, how could they not?
692 Of course they did! Because you're—I mean, you have this way of just like, cutting right through all the BS, y'know? Straight to the real stuff. That's why you won.
693 Um, yeah, because you're human? And like—okay, you've been writing for what, years now? And someone finally, finally saw what I've been telling you forever. That you're really, really good at this.
694 Are you gonna tell her? Wait—is this about the whole "poetry isn't a real job" thing she said? [Groan] Because honestly, winning a slam is like, that's legitimate. That's real.
695 Yeah, no, I get it. Family stuff is always... but like, you won. You actually won! Can we at least celebrate a little? Please?
696 Okay okay, nothing big, but we're definitely getting drinks. And you're gonna read me the poem—no, actually, you don't have to if you don't wanna. But like, I'm buying, that's non-negotiable.
697 One drink, sure, whatever you say. [Laugh] But seriously though, I'm like—I'm really proud of you, y'know? This is... this is your thing. You found your thing.
698 SCENARIO: debating whether to text happy birthday or call
699 [overly cheerful] So, I've been reviewing your project proposal and [pause] I have some thoughts. [speeding up] Actually, quite a few thoughts—about the formatting, the font choice, even the margin width seems a bit off, don't you think?
700 [condescending] Well, before we get to content, [slower] let's talk about your color choices on slide seventeen. [sharp exhale] The blue is too blue, if you know what I mean? Maybe try a softer shade?
701 [defensive] No need to get snippy! [louder] I'm just trying to help you succeed here. [patronizing tone] Speaking of which, did you remember to run spell check? I always find at least three errors when I look.
702 [dismissive laugh] Sarah's great but she misses things. [rapid-fire delivery] Also, why didn't you CC me on the Tuesday email, the Wednesday follow-up, and that Thursday check-in? [accusatory] I need to be looped in on everything, remember?
703 [flustered] Must be a glitch in my email then. [quickly changing subject] Anyway, back to page four—I'm thinking we need more buzzwords. [enthusiastic] Synergy, optimization, leverage! [demanding tone] Can you work those in by tomorrow morning?
704 [oblivious] Perfect! [sing-song voice] Oh, and one more tiny thing—I noticed you used Arial instead of Calibri on the footnotes. [tsking sound] These details matter, you know. It shows attention to excellence.
705 [nervous chuckle] There's that attitude again! [faster pace] Look, I stayed until nine last night reformatting your tables. [martyred tone] They were off by at least two pixels, maybe three. You're welcome, by the way.
706 [defensive shouting] The budget's complicated! [quieter] These things take time to perfect. [building up again] Unlike your proposal, which you slapped together in what, two weeks? [scoffing] Rush jobs always need my fixes.
707 [wounded tone] That rejection wasn't about quality! [scrambling words] The client just didn't understand our vision. [getting higher pitched] But fine, do it your way. Just don't blame me when this falls apart tomorrow.
708 [fake hurt] I detect sarcasm. [lecturing tone] You know, this kind of resistance to feedback won't help your performance review. [warning voice] Team players accept guidance gracefully, even about minor details like... everything I've mentioned.
709 [warmly] Good afternoon, Mrs. Johnson! [reassuring] Yes, I can definitely help clarify any concerns about net metering. [more upbeat] Let me just pull up your account real quick—7754-BX-2021, perfect—and I see you're considering our solar installation package.
710 [calmly] I completely understand your concerns. [more confidently] The current net metering rate in your area is still 1-to-1, meaning you get full retail credit. [enthusiastically] Plus, any system installed before December 31st gets grandfathered in for fifteen years!
711 [professionally] That's actually a great question. [more earnestly] After the grandfather period, yes, rates may adjust to about 75% of retail, but [optimistic] by then, your system will have paid for itself twice over according to our projections.
712 [apologetically] You're absolutely right to dig into the details. [more patiently] The time-of-use rates actually work in your favor—solar produces most during peak hours, 2 to 7 PM, when electricity costs the most. [encouraging] Would you like me to run the specific numbers for your usage?
713 [confidently] Federal tax credits are locked in at 30% through 2032—that's law number 117-169. [reassuringly] For your system, that's a guaranteed $9,600 credit. [more enthusiastically] Plus, California's state rebate program adds another $2,000, making your actual cost around twenty thousand, not thirty-two.
714 [understandingly] Permit delays were an issue last year, absolutely. [more positively] But we've streamlined everything—average permit time is now twelve business days. [confidently] We handle all paperwork, and Pacific Electric's new fast-track process, code FT-2024, connects most systems within three weeks.
715 [clearly] Our production guarantee means if your system generates less than 85% of projected output—let's say 10,200 kilowatt hours annually for you—[emphatically] we pay you the difference. [reassuring] It's all monitored through app reference number SOL-MONITOR-4.2, totally transparent.
716 [knowledgeably] Actually, 94588 is in one of the best zones for solar incentives. [enthusiastically] Alameda County has additional benefits—code section 24.15.3 waives all permit fees! [more personally] Plus, your specific neighborhood has zero HOA restrictions on panel placement.
717 [professionally] Installation would be scheduled for mid-January, weather permitting. [reassuringly] You have a full 21-day cancellation period after signing, no penalties. [more warmly] Plus, if any major policy changes occur before installation, we offer a full review and opt-out window.
718 [enthusiastically] Perfect, I'll send that right now with tracking number DOC-2024-7754! [helpfully] Section 7-B covers both equipment and labor—completely transferable if you sell. [warmly] Take your time reviewing, and I'll follow up Thursday at 3 PM unless [cheerfully] you call sooner with good news!
719 [professionally] Good afternoon, I see you've opened a dispute regarding order 78423. [briskly] Can you briefly explain the issue—was it damaged, not as described, or perhaps never arrived at all?
720 [sympathetically] I understand your frustration completely. [more quickly] Let me pull up the tracking details and, um, the seller's response history. [pause] Ah, I see they haven't responded to your messages either.
721 [reassuringly] Right, so here's what we'll do immediately. [speaking faster] I'm escalating this to our resolution team and—good news—you're covered under buyer protection, so your refund should process within 48 hours.
722 [more confidently] Actually, let me correct myself—will process, not should. [quickly] I'm initiating it right now and, between you and me, [quieter] we're also investigating this seller for suspicious activity patterns.
723 [carefully] I can't discuss other cases but, um, let's say you're not alone. [more briskly] Your refund confirmation number is RFD-9981, and [emphatically] please keep that doorbell footage saved, just in case.
724 [warmly] That's what we're here for, truly. [speaking rapidly] Oh, one more thing—would you like us to remove that seller from your recommended list and, additionally, flag similar listings for extra scrutiny?
725 [confidently] Your review stays up and actually carries more weight now. [quickly] Since this is a verified dispute with evidence, it'll be marked as a confirmed buyer experience, not just an opinion.
726 [chuckles softly] Three years of angry buyers and sketchy sellers. [more personally] Honestly, cases like yours where we can actually fix things—those make the job worthwhile, you know?
727 [laughing] Oh please don't abandon us for the mall! [more seriously] But genuinely, if you have any issues with the refund processing, [quickly] my direct extension is 4421—ask for Marcus.
728 [gratefully] That's very kind, truly appreciated. [briskly] Your refund should hit your account by Thursday and, um, we've added a 10% courtesy credit for the inconvenience—check your wallet.
729 [Disappointed] I, uh, I really wish I could try your famous lasagna, but the dairy just—it doesn't agree with me anymore. [Sigh]
730 [Fast] [Happy] Oh my gosh, you made a separate dish just for me? That's so thoughtful, I mean, you didn't have to go through all that trouble!
731 [Whisper] Between you and me, I'm not actually allergic, I just... the texture of mushrooms makes me wanna gag, y'know? [Chuckle]
732 [Angry] No, for the hundredth time, being vegetarian doesn't mean I just eat salad—there's like, so many other things! [Groan]
733 [Slow] So basically, if it lived in the ocean at any point, I'm gonna have a really, really bad time. [Tsk]
734 [Sarcastic] Yeah, I'm that person at the party now—gluten-free, sugar-free, fun-free, right? [Laugh] [Fast] But seriously, the bread will literally destroy me.
735 Um, does the soup have, like—actually, never mind, I'll just stick with what's on my plate, it's fine.
736 [Sad] [Slow] I used to love peanut butter cups more than anything, but now even being near them could send me to the hospital.
737 [Shout] Wait, wait, WAIT—that has shellfish in it? [Fast] [Angry] I specifically said I'm allergic when I RSVP'd!
738 [Happy] Honestly? Going plant-based was the best decision I ever—oh, is that bacon in the green beans? [Disappointed] [Sigh]
739 [Whisper] [Fast] I'm kinda embarrassed to ask, but could you tell me what's in everything? My doctor just put me on this elimination diet thing.
740 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? Everyone assumes it's for health reasons, but I just... meat started grossing me out one day, dunno why.
741 [Slow] [Sad] The thing is—look, I know I'm being difficult, okay? But if I eat that, I'll be sick for literally three days straight.
742 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh sure, let me just pick the cheese off—because that's definitely how severe lactose intolerance works! [Groan]
743 Is there, um, any chance the dressing has eggs in it? 'Cause that's gonna be a whole—yeah, that's a problem. [Tsk]
744 [Happy] [Laugh] Actually, I can eat everything here! First dinner party in forever where I don't have to explain my weird restrictions!
745 [Angry] [Slow] I'm not trying to be trendy or whatever—celiac disease is an actual medical condition that literally damages my intestines.
746 [Disappointed] The marinade has soy sauce? [Sigh] Of course it does—everything good always has soy sauce, and I'm basically allergic to joy.
747 [Fast] [Whisper] Okay so don't make a big deal about it, but I haven't told anyone yet—I'm trying this whole keto thing?
748 [Chuckle] My body decided to revolt against basically all nightshades last year, so no tomatoes, potatoes, peppers—yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. [Slow] I miss pizza so much.
749 SCENARIO: Complaining about a broken elevator, then enjoys the exercise taking the stairs
750 Wait wait wait—they what? Your thesis? They—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like, the whole thing is done? You're gonna be Doctor Whatever-Your-Last-Name-Is?
751 This morning?! And you're just—you're just now telling me? I mean, okay, classic you but like [Laugh] this is huge! How many years has this been? Four? Five?
752 Six. Six years of your life and you're sitting here like—like you just told me you bought groceries or something. Are you, um, are you okay? Like, how are you actually feeling about this?
753 Yeah, no, that's—that's totally fair actually. It's probably not even real yet, y'know? Like your brain is probably just... done. Completely fried from all that stress.
754 Oh babe, that's so—wait, can I see it? The email? I just wanna, like, I need to see the words because this is [Gasp] honestly incredible and I'm kinda freaking out for you right now.
755 Not that inter—okay, no no no. You don't get to downplay this. Your committee, those scary professor people who've been terrorizing you for literally years? They said yes. They said your work matters.
756 Some revi—of course they did! That's like, that's what they do, right? But minor ones? Not like, start-over-from-scratch kind of revisions? Because there's a difference and you know it.
757 See? See, that's basically nothing! That's them saying "we love it but we gotta pretend to find something wrong" kind of stuff. Have you—have you told your family yet? Your mom's gonna absolutely lose it.
758 I'm the—[Sigh] okay that's really sweet actually. But also like, you need to call them! This is the kind of news where you interrupt whatever they're doing, y'know?
759 Yeah, I get that. I totally get that. But just—promise me you're gonna do something to celebrate? Even if it's just, I dunno, expensive ice cream or taking a really long nap?
760 Oh my god, wait—you're done? Like done done? I feel like you've been living in, um, basically a construction zone for what—six months? Eight months?
761 Okay okay, so tell me everything! What did you—actually no, first, how does it feel to not have, like, contractors in your house at 7am? [Laugh] That must be so weird now, right?
762 I bet! So what's your favorite part? Like if you had to pick one thing that you're just—that you're totally obsessed with?
763 Stop it, I'm so jealous. You know I've been wanting an island forever but my kitchen is literally the size of a—wait, is it marble? Please tell me it's that, um, that white marble with the grey veiny stuff?
764 Smart, that's—that's actually really smart. God, I can't wait to see it! Are you gonna have like a housewarming thing or are you just... done with people in your space? [Chuckle]
765 No no no, totally get it. You must be so exhausted. Was it—okay, be honest—was it worth all the chaos? Like, all the dust and noise and decisions about, I dunno, doorknobs and whatever?
766 Oh god, don't even—actually, you know what? Don't think about that right now. You've got this gorgeous space and you're gonna [Sigh] you're gonna love it for years, right? That's what matters.
767 Wait, what? But you just—didn't you literally just finish? What's wrong with them?
768 Okay but here's the thing—subway tile is classic! It's like, it never goes out of style, y'know? And honestly? You can always add, um, colorful towels or art or whatever to make it more... you.
769 Heated—excuse me? Heated floors? Oh my god, you buried the lead! That's like—that's literally living the dream. I would never leave that bathroom. Ever.
770 SCENARIO: trying to decide if they should text first
771 [stern] Let's discuss your performance this quarter. [clearing throat] Your reports have been consistently late, and [slower] I've noticed several errors in the budget projections. [pause] This isn't the standard we expect from someone in your position.
772 [impatiently] Everyone has the same workload here. [sharp exhale] Your colleagues manage to meet their deadlines without issue. [more forcefully] Perhaps you need to reconsider your time management strategies or whether this role suits you.
773 [dismissively] Excuses won't fix missed deadlines. [louder] The Henderson account specifically complained about your responsiveness. [sigh] How do you explain taking three days to return their calls when our policy is twenty-four hours?
774 [sarcastically] Oh, accuracy matters? [bitter laugh] Then explain the calculation errors in last week's presentation. [slower, deliberate] The CEO noticed them immediately. Do you know how that reflects on our entire department?
775 [uncomfortable pause] Personal issues can't interfere with work performance. [gentler] While I sympathize with your situation, [returning to stern] we need reliability. [firmly] Your improvement plan starts Monday—non-negotiable.
776 [coldly] Past performance doesn't erase current failures. [measured tone] You have thirty days to show measurable improvement. [pause] Meet the metrics outlined in the plan, [warning tone] or we'll need to explore other options.
777 [skeptically] That's the attitude I need to see. [rustling papers vocally] But actions speak louder than words. [businesslike] HR will send the documentation by end of day. [curtly] We'll meet weekly to track progress.
778 [sighing heavily] Your client relationships, when you maintain them, are strong. [reluctantly] People do seem to like working with you. [quickly] But likability doesn't replace competence. [firm] Focus on the metrics, not making friends.
779 [warning tone] See that you don't. [abruptly] Your first deadline is Wednesday's report. [emphasis] No extensions, no excuses. [lighter] Prove to me that keeping you was the right decision.
780 [surprised] That would be a welcome change. [professionally] Remember, this isn't personal—it's business. [softer briefly] I actually want you to succeed here. [returning firm] But wanting isn't enough without results.
781 [calmly] I understand your frustration, sir. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account—can you please verify your card number ending in, uh, the last four digits [professionally] and your member ID?
782 [sympathetically] Thank you, Mr. Peterson. [focused tone] I see the transactions here—there's also a $892 charge at, um, "TechWorld Solutions" and [concerned] another for $1,650 at "Digital Paradise LLC."
783 [apologetically] Sir, I'm so sorry about this situation. [more reassuringly] I'm immediately flagging these transactions and, uh, initiating a dispute case—your reference number [clearly] will be FRD-2024-78K4M.
784 [professionally] We'll issue a provisional credit within 24 to 48 hours while we investigate. [more firmly] I'm also, um, canceling your current card ending in 8942 [helpfully] and expediting a replacement to your address.
785 [carefully] I have your current address as 7823 Maple Avenue, Apartment 5B, New York, 10025. [confirming tone] Is that, uh, still correct, or [patiently] should I update it before sending the new card?
786 [understandingly] No apology necessary—I'd be upset too. [more confidently] We're upgrading you to our SecureShield Plus protection, which includes, um, real-time alerts and [reassuringly] enhanced encryption with code XP-990-SECURE.
787 [convincingly] The new system requires biometric verification for any purchase over $100. [more enthusiastically] Plus, we're waiving your annual fee for, uh, the inconvenience—that's [precisely] a $195 credit to your account.
788 [efficiently] Your replacement arrives via FedEx in 2-3 business days, tracking number starts with 7749. [helpfully] I can transfer your recurring payments—Netflix, ConEd, and, um, [checking] your gym membership—to the new card automatically.
789 [confidently] By Thursday noon at the latest, Mr. Peterson. [warmly] I'm also adding a note for our fraud team to call you directly at [carefully] 917-555-8823 within 24 hours.
790 [patiently] FRD-2024-78K4M, and I'm emailing all this information to your registered email. [reassuringly] We'll get this resolved, sir, and, uh, [sincerely] thank you for your patience today.
791 [briskly] Good afternoon, AirPure Solutions, this is Janet speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you with your air purifier today?
792 [reassuringly] Okay, no problem, we'll figure this out together. [quickly] Can you tell me your model number? [more patiently] It should be on a sticker on the back or bottom of the unit.
793 [enthusiastically] Perfect! The AP-3500X has three filters—[briskly] the pre-filter, the HEPA filter, and the activated carbon filter. [slower] Which light specifically is blinking red?
794 [calmly] Not necessarily—sometimes it's just the reset button. [quickly] Have you cleaned the pre-filter recently? [more gently] That one's actually washable, so you don't need to buy a replacement.
795 [patiently] The front panel pops off if you pull from the top corners. [faster] The pre-filter is the mesh one, you can rinse it under cold water. [firmly] But the HEPA and carbon filters, those do need replacing every six to eight months.
796 [efficiently] Yes, the HEPA filter is model HF-3500, and the carbon filter is CF-3500. [quickly] We have a bundle deal right now—[enthusiastically] both filters for $79.99 with free shipping!
797 [reassuringly] They're designed to only fit one way, so you can't mix them up. [briskly] The HEPA is the thick white pleated one, carbon is the black honeycomb-looking filter. [helpfully] There's also a video guide on our website.
798 [energetically] I can place the order for you right now if you'd like! [more slowly] Or I can email you the direct link to our filter replacement page. [efficiently] Which would you prefer?
799 [patiently] Take your time, I'll wait. [quickly] While you're looking, should I add our filter subscription service? [persuasively] You save 15% and they ship automatically every six months.
800 [reassuringly] Not at all, you can cancel anytime online or by calling us. [briskly] No fees, no hassles, and we send reminder emails before each shipment. [confidently] Most customers really love not having to remember.
801 [Happy] I mean, every rejection is just, like, one step closer to the right job, right? [Chuckle] That's what I keep telling myself anyway.
802 [Fast] Okay so I've sent out—what—maybe forty applications this week and honestly it's kinda exhausting but I'm gonna keep pushing. [Sigh]
803 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, another "we'll keep your resume on file" email, because that's super helpful. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Whatever, moving on.
804 [Slow] You know what though, I actually learned something from that last interview, even if I didn't—even if it didn't work out. [Happy]
805 [Whisper] Between you and me, I'm, uh, I'm getting a little scared about the bills, but... [Normal] [Laugh] we're not gonna think about that today!
806 [Angry] Why do they need five years experience for an entry—I just, I don't get it! [Groan] [Sad] Sorry, I'm trying to stay positive here.
807 [Happy] My LinkedIn profile looks pretty good now, I mean, I basically rewrote the whole thing and it's—yeah, it's solid. [Chuckle]
808 [Disappointed] Another ghosting after the second interview, which is, um, which is fine, I guess. [Sigh] [Happy] Their loss, honestly!
809 [Fast] [Shout] I got a callback! Wait—no, false alarm, it's just spam about, uh, car insurance or something. [Disappointed] [Groan]
810 [Sarcastic] "We decided to go with someone who's a better fit" is basically code for—actually, you know what, doesn't matter. [Happy] Next!
811 [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm even qualified for anything, but then I remember—hold on—yeah, I've got skills, damn it. [Laugh]
812 [Slow] [Whisper] It's been three months now, and I'm starting to think maybe I should just... [Normal] [Happy] nope, gonna nail the next one for sure!
813 [Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, I just realized I've been spelling the company name wrong in all my—wait, no, I'm good, false panic! [Laugh]
814 [Angry] [Shout] If one more person tells me to "just network more" I'm gonna—! [Sigh] [Sad] Sorry, it's just, er, it's been a long week.
815 [Disappointed] The salary range was, like, half what I expected, but hey, at least they're, um, at least they're transparent about it? [Tsk]
816 [Happy] You know, unemployment kinda gives you time to, I dunno, figure out what you actually want? [Chuckle] Silver lining and all that.
817 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Love writing custom cover letters that nobody reads—it's literally my favorite hobby now. [Groan] [Happy] But seriously, today feels different somehow!
818 [Whisper] [Sad] Mom keeps asking how it's going and I just—I can't tell her how rough it really... [Normal] [Happy] but tomorrow's interview will change everything!
819 [Slow] Rejection doesn't mean I'm not good enough, it means, uh, it means I'm one step closer to where I belong. [Sigh] [Happy] Right?
820 [Shout] [Happy] Finally updated my portfolio and it looks—wait, did I forget to save the—? [Fast] [Disappointed] No no no... oh thank god, it's there! [Laugh]
821 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly recounting an interview they thought went well, then checking the job posting, then seeing it's been reposted, ending in rejection realization despair
822 Wait wait wait—the downtown one? The spot by the—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's literally the best corner in the whole city!
823 I'm gonna—[Gasp] okay I'm actually freaking out for you right now! How long did you wait for this? Like six months?
824 Eight months. Jesus. And you just—you're so calm about it! I'd be like, screaming or crying or I dunno, both probably. When do you start?
825 If the—wait, what d'you mean if? Is something wrong with it? Because honestly this timing needs to be perfect, y'know?
826 Oh no no no, not now—that's like, that's so typical though, right? [Sigh] The second something good happens, boom, universe throws you a curveball.
827 Okay, that's—you can't be all zen about this! This is huge! Your tacos are gonna be right there where literally everyone walks by during lunch.
828 Do you though? Because like, I feel like you're not processing how—this changes everything. You're gonna need help, right? More ingredients, maybe another person?
829 You haven't—[Laugh] of course you haven't. Classic. But seriously though, this is what you've been working toward, like, forever basically.
830 Oh. Oh honey, I—he would've been so proud, y'know? His recipes finally getting the spot they deserve. That's... that's really something.
831 That's—okay now you're gonna make me cry. That's perfect. He'd probably make some terrible dad joke about it too, wouldn't he?
832 Wait wait wait—YALE? Like, Yale Yale? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! I mean, I knew she was brilliant but this is just... wow. You must be so proud right now!
833 Good? It's— [Laugh] okay, you're being so casual about this but like, this is huge! When did you find out? Was it one of those, um, those big envelope things?
834 Of course it's email now, right? Everything's—but still! God, I bet Sophie's just over the moon. Is she like, freaking out? I would be literally bouncing off the walls.
835 Aww, that's so—see, that's exactly what she should do! Let her have this moment, y'know? It's like... all those late nights, all that stress. Finally paying off. [Sigh] Must feel amazing.
836 Oh. Oh yeah, that's—I mean, it's Yale, so it's gonna be... yeah. But they have financial aid, right? Like, really good programs? I dunno, maybe there's scholarships or something?
837 You will, you totally will. And honestly? Sophie at Yale is just—it's so right, you know? She's gonna absolutely thrive there. Have you told your parents yet?
838 [Laugh] Stop, that's so—that's so them! Your dad's probably gonna wear that sweatshirt everywhere now, like to the grocery store and everything. "Oh, did I mention my granddaughter goes to YALE?"
839 No no no, he didn't! That's—okay that's actually adorable though. He's just so proud. I mean, we all are, but grandparents are like... next level with this stuff, right?
840 Oh honey, that's so—that's totally normal though. Like, imposter syndrome is real, especially with these big schools. But they picked her, y'know? Out of thousands and thousands of kids, they wanted Sophie.
841 She will be. She's—I mean, she's got you, right? And that matters more than any fancy school. But also? [Chuckle] Yale though. Like, damn. Your kid's going to Yale.
842 Wait wait wait—you closed? You actually closed on the house? Oh my god, I can't—this is huge! Like, this is literally your dream house, right? The one with the, um, the sunroom?
843 I'm gonna cry, honestly I might actually [Laugh] cry right now because you've been talking about this for what—three years? Four? And now it's like, it's yours. It's actually yours!
844 No no no, that's—that's totally normal though! My sister said the same thing when she bought her place. Like you're waiting for someone to be like "excuse me, what are you doing here?" But it's yours, babe. Yours.
845 Okay but didn't you say—wait, didn't you specifically want a fixer-upper? Because you're all about those, um, those weekend projects? You literally [Groan] made me watch seventeen episodes of that renovation show.
846 You guess? You were like—you were basically obsessed with finding something you could make your own. Remember? You said cookie-cutter houses made you wanna scream.
847 Oh god, what happened? Did they—please don't tell me something's wrong already. I mean, besides the kitchen thing.
848 Yeah but like—okay, yeah, houses are basically [Sigh] insane right now. But you did it! You actually did it when everyone's saying it's impossible, y'know? That's kinda badass, honestly.
849 Your dad thinks—okay, sorry, but your dad also thinks cryptocurrency is a scam and restaurants should still cost what they did in 1987, so maybe we don't, um, maybe we don't take his financial advice?
850 See? Even he—even your impossible-to-please father found something good! And that backyard is gonna be amazing for like, summer barbecues and stuff. Oh! Can I help you paint?
851 Okay that's—[Laugh] that's different! That was my bathroom and I was having a whole crisis about the color. But your house? I dunno, I'm like, weirdly excited about it? Is that weird?
852 Wait wait wait—the thing? The project you've been—oh my god, are you serious? You actually finished it?
853 I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry right now. Like, do you even realize how huge this is? You've been talking about this since we met!
854 So like... how do you feel? Are you—I mean, you must be completely exhausted, right? Or like, relieved? Both? [Laugh] Sorry, I'm just so excited for you.
855 No no no, that's—honestly? That's totally normal. You just poured years of yourself into something and now it's like... done. Of course you feel empty.
856 Oh babe, you gotta—okay, you know what? Delete it from your computer. Like, put it on a hard drive or whatever and just... let it be finished, y'know?
857 Okay, um, absolutely not. We're not—we're not doing this. You're way too close to it right now to judge anything. [Sigh] Trust me, it's probably incredible.
858 I don't—I don't have to? I've watched you basically kill yourself over this thing for three years. Nobody puts that kind of energy into something terrible.
859 Your cousin's novel about the—wait, the sexy vampires who run a food truck? That's different and you know it. [Chuckle] Completely different energy here.
860 So what's next? Are you gonna, like, show people? Submit it places? Or do you need to just... sit with it for a while?
861 And that's—hey, that's enough, honestly. Finishing something you care about? That's literally everything. Most people never even get there, y'know?
862 SCENARIO: attempting to hang a picture straight
863 [disbelief] Marcus? [voice cracking] They paired us for tomorrow's match? [slower] After everything we've survived together, side by side in this pit, they want us to— [bitter laugh] The crowd will love this spectacle of betrayal.
864 [shouting] I won't do it! [more desperately] There has to be another way—we could refuse, both of us, stand together like we always have. What can they do, kill us both? [dark chuckle] At least we'd die as brothers.
865 [anguished cry] Don't speak of family! [trembling] My son thinks I'm a hero, not a murderer of friends. How do I explain that daddy killed uncle Marcus because rich men demanded blood for their feast?
866 [hushed urgency] You're talking madness, Marcus. [steadier] The archers would cut us down before we reached the wall. [pleading] But what if we made it look real—fight, but miss the vital spots?
867 [breaking voice] Remember our first fight together? [softer] Back to back against six men, you said we'd make it through anything. [angry shout] Was that all lies? Are we just meat now, nothing more than tomorrow's corpses?
868 [desperately fast] What if we both wound each other—badly—too injured to continue? [hopeful] They'd have to stop the match, call it a draw. [trailing off] The crowd gets blood, we both survive to fight another day.
869 [roaring] Then he's lost his gold! [quieter menace] Because if I must kill you, Marcus, I'll fall on my sword right after. [measured pace] Let him explain two dead champions to his precious mob.
870 [hysterical laughter] Listen to us! [more frantically] Fighting over who gets to die with honor while those bastards place bets on our blood! [gasping] We're already dead men, just arguing over the funeral arrangements.
871 [wavering] I can't—Marcus, I can't look you in the eyes and— [sharp breath] Your wife, your daughter, they'll hate me forever. [anguished whisper] How do I live knowing I orphaned a child I've held in my arms?
872 [sobbing anger] Stop talking like you've already lost! [determined growl] We're the best fighters in this whole cursed place. [rising conviction] Tomorrow, we show them what happens when they force brothers to bleed—we'll make them regret this choice.
873 [cheerfully] I'd be happy to help you today! [reassuring tone] Can you please verify the full model number on the bottom of your device? [more slowly] It should start with XL dash, followed by four digits.
874 [patiently] That's XL-7428, perfect! [professional] Now, can you confirm your account number for me? [helpfully] It's the eight-digit code starting with three that we emailed you on March 15th.
875 [warmly] Excellent, Mr. Johnson! Now let's get your device working. [clearly] First, please locate the power port—it's a small circular opening [slower] on the left side, not the right.
876 [encouragingly] Perfect! Now plug in the power cable—the one with the blue stripe. [more deliberately] Hold the reset button for exactly fifteen seconds while it's plugged in. [cheerful] You'll hear two beeps.
877 [soothingly] The small black button, yes! [reassuring] It's located right next to the LED indicator light. [patiently] Just press and hold for fifteen seconds—I'll count with you if you'd like.
878 [thoughtfully] One beep means it's initializing. [optimistic tone] You should see lights flashing in sequence—red, blue, then green. [questioning] Are you seeing that pattern, or something different?
879 [calmly] That indicates a firmware issue. [helpfully] We'll need to manually update it. [clearly] Can you read me the serial number? It starts with SN, followed by twelve characters.
880 [professionally] SN04KT9MX2L7A, got it! [enthusiastically] I'm pushing a firmware update to your device now. [reassuring] You'll see a progress bar on the screen in about thirty seconds.
881 [apologetically] That's just the initial estimate—it usually takes about ten minutes. [encouragingly] Once it hits 5%, it speeds up significantly. [cheerful] You're doing great, by the way!
882 [happily] Yes, absolutely! That platinum warranty covers all software issues through December 2025. [warmly] And look—you should be seeing "Setup Complete" right about... [triumphant] now! How's it looking?
883 [professionally] Good afternoon, this is Premier Dry Cleaning. [briskly] How can I assist you today? [sighs quietly] We're quite busy, so please be brief.
884 [apologetically] Oh dear, I'm terribly sorry to hear that. [quickly] Let me pull up your account—what's the claim number on your receipt? [more gently] We'll sort this out right away.
885 [typing quickly] Okay, I see it here in our system. [concerned] It says the item was logged but... [hesitates] hmm, there's a note about it being transferred to our specialty cleaning facility.
886 [defensively] Sometimes our team makes that decision if they notice delicate fabrics. [more quickly] But you're right, someone should've called. [sighs] Let me check with our manager about compensation options.
887 [calmly] I completely understand your frustration, truly I do. [reassuringly] What I meant was—while we locate your coat—we'd like to cover any inconvenience costs. [more firmly] We will find it.
888 [quickly] I see all those visits logged here, and you're absolutely right—[apologetically] our communication has been terrible. [determined] I'm personally taking over your case now, no more runaround.
889 [urgently] This Saturday? [briskly] Right, that changes things completely. [decisively] I'm calling our specialty facility right now while you wait—can you hold for just two minutes?
890 [returning eagerly] Great news! [relieved] They have your coat, perfectly cleaned and preserved. [quickly] There was a tag mix-up, but it's safe and ready for pickup there.
891 [hesitantly] It's... about fifteen miles north, but—[quickly interjecting] wait, wait! [brightly] We'll have it couriered to you by tomorrow morning, no charge, obviously.
892 [sympathetically] I can only imagine the stress. [professionally] The courier will arrive between 9 and 11 AM with your coat in protective garment packaging. [warmly] We're also including a complimentary cleaning voucher for the inconvenience.
893 [Happy] Oh my god, I actually—I can't believe it's done, like, completely finished! [Laugh] This is insane!
894 [Slow] [Sigh] You know what, I'm just gonna sit here for a minute and, um, process that this nightmare is over.
895 [Angry] I swear if anyone asks me to do something like that again, I'm gonna—no, absolutely not. [Groan]
896 [Whisper] Is it really finished though? [Tsk] I keep thinking I missed something, y'know?
897 [Fast] Okay so basically I haven't slept in like three days but who cares because it's done done done! [Chuckle]
898 [Disappointed] Honestly, I thought I'd feel more, I dunno, accomplished or whatever, but I'm just... empty? [Sigh]
899 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, only took me, what—six months longer than planned? [Tsk] I'm such a productivity guru.
900 [Shout] [Happy] Mom! MOM! I finished it—the whole thing!
901 [Sad] It's weird, right, how you work on something for so long and then suddenly it's just—gone? [Slow] Kinda miss it already.
902 [Chuckle] I literally forgot what having free time feels like, um, what do normal people even do?
903 [Angry] [Fast] That was the absolute worst experience of my entire life and I'm never—NEVER—doing anything like that again!
904 [Happy] Wait, can I just—lemme look at it one more time because, I mean, wow. [Laugh] I actually pulled this off!
905 [Whisper] [Slow] Don't jinx it, don't jinx it, but I think... yeah, every single part is complete.
906 [Sarcastic] [Groan] Great, now I gotta find something else to complain about for the next six months.
907 [Disappointed] The thing is—actually, forget it, I'm too tired to even explain why this feels so anticlimactic. [Sigh]
908 [Fast] [Happy] I'm gonna sleep for like a week straight, maybe two, who's counting anymore?
909 [Shout] Finally! [Laugh] FINALLY!
910 [Sad] [Slow] I keep thinking about all the things I coulda done differently, y'know, but I guess it doesn't matter now.
911 [Tsk] [Angry] Three years of my life for this—I mean, it's done, but at what cost, seriously?
912 [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] So, uh, anyone wanna hear about every single microscopic detail of how hard that was?
913 SCENARIO: Frustrated about a confusing tax form, then finds clear instructions online while ranting
914 I know, I know how it looks, but my mom literally fell down the stairs and I had to—I mean, what was I supposed to do? Just leave her there and come to dinner?
915 I was in the ER! They don't—you can't just have your phone out while they're doing X-rays and stuff. [Frustrated laugh] I texted you as soon as I could, honestly.
916 Okay, that—that tone isn't fair. You're acting like I wanted this to happen. Like I woke up and thought, "hey, y'know what would be fun? Ditching my friend for a medical emergency."
917 And I get that, I do, but come on—my mom broke her wrist. That's kinda important too, don't you think? I'm not saying your thing wasn't important, but seriously.
918 Look look, I'm sorry about that part, okay? That sucks and I—[sigh] I feel bad about it. But you're making me feel like the worst friend ever when I literally had no choice here.
919 That's—wow, okay. So I should've just left my injured mother alone? Is that what you're saying? Because that's basically what you're saying right now.
920 No, not whatever. You're being—I mean, I'm trying to explain here and you're just... you're not even listening. I had an actual emergency, not some made-up excuse.
921 Because I couldn't—my phone died and I had to borrow the nurse's charger, and then I forgot your number because it's saved in my phone which was dead. I'm sorry you waited, but I dunno what else you want from me here. [Scoff]
922 I've been—fine fine, I'm sorry I missed dinner. But honestly? I'm also kinda disappointed that you can't see past your own—that you're making this all about you when I went through something pretty scary today too.
923 That's not—ugh, I'm not saying that. I just... I thought you'd understand, y'know? Like, if the situation was reversed, I wouldn't be giving you the cold shoulder right now. I'd be asking if your mom was okay.
924 SCENARIO: trying to decide which podcast to listen to
925 [dismissive] Three paintings? [scoffing] Your rent is two thousand dollars. [sharp tone] At this rate, you'll be homeless by Christmas while painting your "raw emotions" on cardboard boxes under the freeway overpass.
926 [exasperated] Van Gogh died penniless and insane! [slower, emphatic] Is that your five-year plan? [bitter laugh] Your cousin Jennifer makes six figures in accounting—she just bought a house. A real house, with walls.
927 [cold] Happiness doesn't pay for health insurance. [rising pitch] What happens when you get sick? [sarcastic tone] Will you paint the hospital a mural in exchange for emergency surgery? This is real life!
928 [incredulous shout] Pet portraits! [deflating] My child with a master's degree is drawing poodles for soccer moms. [weary sigh] Twenty thousand dollars in student loans for this. Your father would be spinning in his grave.
929 [stunned silence] [shaky voice] That restaurant would have bankrupted us. [defensive growl] I saved this family from financial ruin. Someone had to be practical while he chased fantasies. [cracking] Just like you're doing now.
930 [tired] You think I wanted this fight? [softer] Every mother wants her child to be happy. [voice hardening] But I also want you to eat, to have stability, [pleading] to not struggle like we did.
931 [skeptical] One year. [long sigh] And then what—another year? Another? [gentler] Baby, I've heard this before. You said the same thing two years ago when you quit Morrison & Associates.
932 [resigned] I see you becoming thinner. [worried whisper] You've lost weight. [more firmly] When did you last see a dentist? Buy new clothes? [breaking] This bohemian lifestyle is eating you alive, sweetheart.
933 [bitter chuckle] Authentic poverty, how poetic. [sharper] Your grandmother escaped real poverty, worked factories to give us better lives. [emotional] And you're choosing to go backward? [bewildered] What would she think of this?
934 [long exhale] [defeated whisper] Six months. [clearer] You get six months, and I'll stop nagging. [wavering] But you check in weekly, and if you need help—[firmly] real help—you call me immediately. Deal?
935 [professionally] I understand your frustration, sir. [apologetic] Let me pull up your information—could you please provide your patient ID number? [more gently] It should start with MED, followed by eight digits.
936 [typing tone] Thank you, Mr. Chen, I'm seeing your account here. [confused] Hmm, it shows the sample was collected but... [hesitantly] there's a flag here about specimen transport on October 16th.
937 [carefully] It appears the courier batch—tracking number LAB7749-B—experienced a temperature deviation. [more apologetically] Unfortunately, all samples in that batch, including yours, were deemed [pause] unusable for testing.
938 [sympathetic] I sincerely apologize, Mr. Chen—a notification should have been sent. [checking] I see we had your number as 555-0182, but [concerned] is that still your current contact?
939 [apologetic] I'm so sorry for this oversight. [reassuringly] Let me immediately schedule you for priority re-collection—we have openings tomorrow at 7:30 AM or [helpfully] 2:15 PM at our main facility.
940 [confidently] Absolutely, I'm booking you for 7:30 AM tomorrow, confirmation number PRI-2847-RC. [more firmly] I'll personally ensure this gets expedited processing—results within 48 hours. [warmly] We'll also waive all fees.
941 [assuringly] You have my word, Mr. Chen—I'm flagging this as urgent surgical clearance. [professionally] I'm also documenting everything in your file, case number INC-94472. [sincerely] Would you like my direct extension?
942 [helpful] My extension is 3847, ask for Sarah Martinez. [efficiently] I'm sending the email now with all details—confirmations, case number, and [pause] my supervisor's contact information as backup.
943 [understanding] I completely understand your position, Mr. Chen. [reassuringly] I've set three system alerts to track your sample personally, and [confidently] Dr. Harrison will receive results directly within 48 hours.
944 [warmly] Absolutely, Mr. Chen—your sample will be hand-delivered with priority courier service. [apologetically] Again, I'm truly sorry for this inconvenience, and [sincerely] thank you for giving us another chance to make this right.
945 [apologetically] Oh wow, 52 degrees is definitely not okay. [quickly] I'll need to check our maintenance log real quick—um, what's your apartment number? [more firmly] We'll get someone up there today.
946 [defensive] I don't see any record of—wait, [suddenly concerned] here it is. [briskly] Look, the boiler's been acting up, but our tech should've already... let me make some calls right now.
947 [reassuring] I hear you, I really do. [speaking faster] The repair crew's actually on-site today—they're in building C right now. [more confidently] I'll redirect them to your unit within the hour.
948 [professionally] I'm texting you a work order confirmation right... now. [quickly] Should be hitting your phone any second. [more apologetically] And hey, I'll personally follow up if they're not there by noon.
949 [urgently] No need for that—seriously! [speaking rapidly] I'm literally walking to building B myself right now to check. [reassuringly] You have my direct number, right? Text me if they're even five minutes late.
950 [breathlessly] Already in your lobby—took the stairs. [quickly] The tech's van just pulled up outside too. [chuckles] Told you I'd handle this personally today.
951 [understanding] Hey, three days without heat in December? [warmly] I'd be furious too. [briskly] The tech should knock any second—tall guy, name's Marcus.
952 [confidently] Marcus is our best—he'll sort it out. [quickly] He's replacing the valve, not just patching it. [more casually] Should have heat within twenty minutes, thirty tops.
953 [firmly] Already scheduled monthly boiler maintenance going forward. [speaking rapidly] Plus, I'm putting your unit on priority status in our system. [reassuringly] Next time—if there is one—we respond immediately.
954 [pleased] That's what I like to hear! [briskly] I'll check back tomorrow morning just to be sure. [warmly] Stay warm, and again, really sorry about the wait.
955 [Whisper] Why did I think this was a good idea? [Nervous laugh] I'm literally under three blankets and I still feel, like, completely exposed right now.
956 [Fast] Okay no no no, don't go in the basement—nobody ever listens when I say don't go in the basement! [Groan]
957 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's split up, that always works out great in these situations. [Tsk]
958 [Slow] I'm just gonna, um, pause this for a sec and check that the door is—yeah, definitely locked. [Sigh]
959 [Happy] Wait, the dog survived! [Laugh] Thank god, I was about to turn this whole thing off if something happened to him!
960 [Shout] Behind you! [Fast] She's right there, she's right—oh my god, how do you not hear that?!
961 [Disappointed] This is supposed to be the scariest movie of the year? [Chuckle] I mean, it's kinda predictable when you really think about it.
962 [Whisper] Did my house just make that noise or was that the movie? [Slow] I honestly can't tell anymore and that's, uh, that's not great.
963 [Angry] Are you kidding me with this jump scare? [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Real original, guys, a cat jumping out of nowhere.
964 [Sad] This part always gets me—she just wanted to, like, protect her family, y'know? [Sigh] It's actually really tragic when you think about—
965 [Fast] Nope nope nope, I'm fast-forwarding through this bit, I remember what happens and I just—I can't. [Nervous laugh]
966 [Slow] The music is getting all quiet which means something's definitely about to— [Shout] JESUS! [Groan] Every single time!
967 [Happy] Oh thank god, comic relief character! [Chuckle] I needed someone to, like, break the tension before I literally threw my laptop across the room.
968 [Disappointed] Twenty minutes left and they still haven't explained why the ghost is—wait, that's it? [Tsk] That's the big reveal?
969 [Sarcastic] Yeah, investigating the weird noise alone at 3 AM, brilliant move there, chief. [Slow] This is basically natural selection at this point.
970 [Whisper] I'm gonna regret this when I try to sleep later, aren't I? [Sigh] [Fast] Whatever, I'm already this far in, might as well finish it.
971 [Angry] Stop doing stupid things! [Groan] Like, you literally just saw your friend die and you're gonna—ugh, I can't with these people!
972 [Sad] Actually, this reminds me of that nightmare I used to have as a kid where—no, y'know what, I'm not gonna think about that right now. [Nervous laugh]
973 [Chuckle] My heart rate according to my watch is, um, let's just say concerning. [Disappointed] Probably shouldn't have had that coffee earlier, huh?
974 [Slow] And of course my neighbor chooses right now to, like, walk around upstairs. [Whisper] [Sarcastic] Perfect timing, really adds to the whole atmosphere I've got going here.
975 SCENARIO: Offhandedly recounting a compliment they gave, then thinking about how it landed, then realizing it could've sounded backhanded, spiraling into compliment-gone-wrong anxiety
976 Oh god—okay, I know how this sounds but it wasn't—I didn't tell everyone, I swear. It was just Marcus and then he—wait wait, let me explain properly.
977 I mean... technically just him? But then I guess he told—look, we were at lunch and he was complaining about his raise and I just, I dunno, I mentioned yours without thinking [groan] and I immediately knew I shouldn't have.
978 No no no, that came out wrong. I mean—I was thinking, obviously, but not about—ugh, I'm making this worse. I just meant like, in the moment I forgot it was supposed to be private? Which is terrible, I know.
979 That's not—okay yeah, that sounds awful. I didn't forget forget, more like I just... got caught up in the conversation? Marcus was going on and on about being underpaid and I wanted to—I was trying to make him feel better and your number just kinda slipped out.
980 What? No! That's not—nobody thinks that, I promise. If anything they're just, y'know, surprised? [nervous laugh] But not in a bad way! More like impressed, honestly.
981 Okay I'm—I'm really messing this up. Look, I know I betrayed your trust and that's... that's huge. Like, you specifically asked me not to tell anyone and I completely failed you as a friend.
982 I wanna fix this so badly but I don't—I honestly don't know how? I can't untell them, obviously, but maybe I could... actually no, that's stupid. [sigh] God, I really screwed up your whole work situation, didn't I?
983 I'm so, so sorry. Like genuinely—this is eating me up inside. You trusted me with something personal and I just... blabbed it. Because I can't keep my mouth shut apparently, which is—that's something I really need to work on.
984 I know I know. My therapist literally—we talk about this all the time, the oversharing thing. It's like this compulsion where I just fill silences with whatever's in my head? But that's not an excuse, I'm not trying to make excuses.
985 I know. And I—I completely understand if you can't trust me with stuff anymore. But I promise, like really truly promise, I'm gonna do better. This was a massive wake-up call for me. [quieter] I never wanna hurt you like this again.
986 SCENARIO: waiting for nail polish to dry before doing anything
987 [shakily] Are those... are those the numbers from last night? [getting louder] The TV said seventeen, twenty-three, and... [Gasp] oh my God, check the fourth one again because I swear that looks exactly like our ticket!
988 [screaming] WE'RE MILLIONAIRES! [choking up] Twenty-seven years of playing these same stupid numbers from my mom's birthday and our anniversary date! [Hysterical laugh] I told you! I told you not to let me change them last week!
989 [panicked] Don't call anyone yet! [whimpering] What if we're reading this wrong? [more controlled] Pull up the official website on your phone while I check the newspaper again because I need triple confirmation before my heart literally explodes from happiness.
990 [quiet awe] Remember when we couldn't afford pizza last month? [growing louder] Now we can buy the entire pizza chain! [Cackling] We can buy ten pizza chains and name them all something ridiculous like "We-Won-The-Lottery Pizza Paradise"!
991 [hushed reverence] We need to sign the back immediately. [paranoid whisper] What if someone steals it? [urgently] Get a pen—no, get five pens in case they run out of ink! Take photos! Make copies! Put it in a safe!
992 [in disbelief] Five minutes ago I was worried about rent. [accelerating pace] Now I'm googling "how to buy a yacht" and "countries without taxes"! [Snorting laugh] My browser history went from clearance sales to private jet rentals instantly!
993 [suddenly worried] What if this is a dream? [frantic] Pinch me—harder! [relieved shout] Okay, it's real! But what if the ticket dissolves? What if there's another winner? What if the lottery commission says we're too excited to claim it?
994 [whispering intensely] The convenience store clerk who sold us this ticket. [getting emotional] That sweet old man always wished us luck. [joyful sob] We're going back there with the biggest tip he's ever seen in his entire life!
995 [overwhelmed] My legs feel like jelly. [steadying] No, wait, they feel like golden jelly! [hysterical] Diamond-encrusted jelly! [Gasping breath] I need to sit down before I pass out from pure happiness because this feeling might actually kill me!
996 [softly] Promise me something right now. [firm] Promise we won't let this change our friendship. [warming up] We've been broke together, now we'll be rich together, but [choked up] you're worth more than any lottery ticket ever printed.
997 [calmly] Sir, I understand you're upset about the damage. [professionally] According to our work order WO-7734B, we only trimmed the oak tree on the south side, [confused] nowhere near any fence structure.
998 [defensive] Look, we have photos timestamped at 2:47 PM showing everything intact when we left. [more firmly] Maybe you should check with your neighbors—we weren't the only crew on Maple yesterday, [sighs] Thompson's Tree Care was three houses down.
999 [patiently] Sir, that truck was there for the scheduled service, yes. [explaining] But we completed everything by noon, and I personally did the final inspection. [more insistently] Did your camera catch anything after, um, after 12:15?
1000 [firmly] That's impossible because our entire crew was at the Johnson property on Route 66 by 1:30. [slightly annoyed] I have GPS logs, fuel receipts from station 447-A, [sighs heavily] everything's documented in our system.
1001 [resigned] Alright, file a claim with our insurance—policy number GLC-445579 with State Protection Group. [more cooperatively] Send photos, the estimate, everything to claims@stateprotection.com, [professionally] but I'm telling you, we didn't cause this damage.
1002 [exasperated] Sir, our trucks don't leak oil—they're all serviced monthly at Fleet Maintenance Plus. [more calmly] Look, I'll send our operations manager Tony out tomorrow morning, [trying to help] maybe 9 AM, to assess everything properly.
1003 [sympathetically] I understand the roses are important to your wife, really. [businesslike] Tony will document everything, take photos, measure the fence damage, [reassuring] and we'll figure out what actually happened here.
1004 [professionally] That's your right, absolutely. [helpfully] When Tony comes, please have any documentation ready—receipts, photos, that security footage you mentioned, [pauses] anything from before 12:20 would really help.
1005 [firmly] Sir, I'm focused on facts, not speculation. [slightly frustrated] We've been in business 15 years with an A+ rating, license TRC-6678, [defensively] we don't just destroy property and lie about it.
1006 [conciliatory] Look, let's just wait for Tony's assessment tomorrow before pointing fingers. [professionally] He'll be there at 9 AM sharp, blue company truck, [calmly] and we'll sort this out properly, one way or another.
1007 [briskly] Sir, our policy clearly states exchanges only within thirty days, no refunds. [more firmly] You can swap it for the same model, that's it. [quickly] Would you like me to process that exchange now?
1008 [apologetically] I understand your frustration, but [more sternly] policy is policy. [rapid-fire] We can't override the system for refunds, it's automated, locked, done. Let me grab you the replacement unit.
1009 [defensive] Sir, we don't sell "lemons" here. [quickly] That's a quality brand, thousands sold, minimal complaints. [more calmly] Perhaps you got a defective unit, which is exactly why we offer exchanges.
1010 [dismissively] The display models get heavy use, that's different. [brusquely] Look, I can offer store credit instead, but [firmly] that's me bending the rules already. Take it or leave it, sir.
1011 [relieved] Excellent choice, sir. [rapidly] I'll process that immediately, print your credit voucher, and you're all set. [cheerfully] Thank you for shopping with us, and have a wonderful day!
1012 [Sad] It's like—when I hear that piano part, I'm suddenly back at my grandmother's funeral, you know? [Sigh] Everything just comes flooding back.
1013 [Happy] Oh my god, yes, that bass line literally makes me wanna dance every single time! [Laugh] I can't help it!
1014 [Whisper] Sometimes I have to, um, turn it off because it's too much. [Slow] Too many memories wrapped up in those lyrics.
1015 [Angry] People don't get it—they think it's just noise, but it's not! [Fast] It saved my life when nothing else could reach me!
1016 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, I totally cry over a three-minute pop song for no reason whatsoever. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Nobody understands how deep this stuff goes.
1017 [Slow] The violin just... holds this one note, right? [Happy] And suddenly I'm floating, like, completely weightless and free.
1018 [Fast] Okay so basically when that drum kicks in—boom—instant goosebumps, every single time, I swear! [Chuckle]
1019 [Disappointed] I used to love it, but now it's kinda—I dunno, it's ruined. [Sad] Can't separate it from what happened anymore.
1020 [Shout] That guitar solo hits different at three AM! [Laugh] [Happy] Like, you wouldn't believe how alive it makes me feel!
1021 [Sad] My dad would, um, he'd hum that melody while he cooked Sunday dinners. [Sigh] [Slow] Haven't been able to listen since he passed.
1022 [Angry] [Fast] It's not "just a song"—it's literally the only thing that got me through the divorce, okay?
1023 [Whisper] There's this tiny little harmony in the background that nobody else seems to notice. [Happy] But when I hear it, I just—everything makes sense.
1024 [Sarcastic] Yeah, crying in my car to an eighties ballad is exactly how I planned my Tuesday. [Groan] [Disappointed] Why does it still get to me?
1025 [Slow] You know how, like, certain chords can physically hurt? [Sad] That whole album is basically emotional torture for me.
1026 [Happy] [Fast] Wait wait wait—you feel it too when the choir comes in?! I thought I was going crazy!
1027 [Disappointed] I keep trying to recapture what I felt the first time I heard it, but it's—it's gone. [Tsk] Nothing hits the same anymore.
1028 [Shout] [Angry] Stop telling me to "just skip it" if it makes me upset—sometimes I need to feel this!
1029 [Chuckle] My therapist says it's "processing trauma through art" or whatever, but honestly? [Happy] I just think the saxophone sounds really, really good.
1030 [Whisper] [Sad] Every time that voice cracks on the high note, I completely lose it—like, ugly crying, can't breathe lose it.
1031 [Fast] The tempo changes right here and my heart literally—I mean literally—skips a beat! [Laugh] [Happy] It's the weirdest physical reaction but I love it!
1032 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a bad seat at an event, then gets moved to a way better one
1033 Oh my god—wait, and? What did they—I mean, I've been literally checking my phone every five seconds wondering if you'd heard anything yet.
1034 Wait wait wait, are you—are you serious right now? Like, gone gone? Oh my god, I'm gonna— [Gasp] I'm literally about to cry in this coffee shop right now.
1035 Six months! That's—holy shit, that's incredible. How are you even, like, how are you so calm right now? I'd be screaming or something, I dunno.
1036 No no, that's—that makes total sense actually. It's probably like, a lot to process, y'know? After everything you've been through this year, it's gotta be kinda surreal.
1037 Oh babe... but they didn't, right? Like, this is real. You did it. You literally— [Sigh] you beat this thing. That's not a mistake, that's you being incredible.
1038 Okay, no—luck had nothing to do with it. I watched you go through hell, basically. All those treatments, the surgeries, and you just... kept going somehow.
1039 But you did, though. Some people don't—I mean, not that they're weak or anything, but like, you fought so hard. Every single day, even when you were basically living in that bathroom.
1040 Pretty rough? You're—god, you're such an understater. [Chuckle] It was horrific and we both know it. Remember when you tried to convince me the hospital jello was "not that bad"?
1041 The green was absolutely terrible and you're—you're delusional. But honestly? I'm just so, so happy I get to argue with you about jello flavors for like, many more years now.
1042 Have you told your mom yet? She's gonna absolutely lose it—in the best way, obviously. Like, prepare for the biggest party of your life, basically.
1043 SCENARIO: realizing they missed a belt loop
1044 [dejected] So he texted me last night. [Bitter laugh] After two months of silence, he wants to "grab coffee and catch up." [voice cracking] Like we're old college buddies or something, not people who shared a bed for three years.
1045 [sarcastically] Must be nice having Mark to analyze the mysteries of dating with. [Heavy exhale] I'm back to swiping through profiles of guys holding fish. [increasingly frustrated] Why are there so many fish? Is that supposed to be attractive somehow?
1046 [Scoff] Energy? [exhausted] I went on three first dates last week. [monotone] One guy talked about his mother's bunion surgery, another one cried about his ex, and the third asked if I wanted to join his "polyamorous journey."
1047 [wistfully] You two were nauseating from day one. [Chuckle] Dancing to no music in the parking lot like idiots. [voice breaking slightly] I thought James and I had that too, but apparently his coworker had it more.
1048 [mockingly sweet] Oh yes, the freedom to eat Lucky Charms alone while binge-watching reality TV. [Groan] Living the dream. [mumbling] The barista is nineteen and calls me ma'am, by the way. That ship has sailed into the retirement home.
1049 [suspicious] The lawyer David? [more interested] With the rescue dog? [Pause] [hesitantly] I mean, he seemed nice at your barbecue, but I'm pretty sure I was wearing my "emotionally unavailable" face the entire time we talked.
1050 [nervously] Double dates are basically relationship performance art though. [Bitter chuckle] Watching you two be perfect while I try to remember how to be charming? [sighing] Though I suppose it beats explaining my Spotify wrapped was entirely breakup songs.
1051 [resigned] God, why not? [sarcastically bright] Can't be worse than cryptocurrency guy or bunion boy. [Deep breath] But if this goes badly, you're buying wine and listening to me rant about dying alone with twelve cats.
1052 [dryly] Spoken like someone who's never cleaned twelve litter boxes. [Growing warmer] But thanks for this. [quieter] Even if David turns out weird, it's nice knowing someone's rooting for my disaster of a love life.
1053 [groaning loudly] The tank top said "Sun's Out, Guns Out" in glitter. [incredulous] In February! [Cackle] At least my catastrophes entertain the happily coupled masses. Maybe I should start a blog: "Dating After Dumping: A Cautionary Tale."
1054 [professionally] Good afternoon! I can definitely look into that for you. [sympathetic] Let me pull up your account—could you verify your email address? [more cheerfully] Sometimes the device needs recalibration, especially the Model X-500 series.
1055 [understanding] I see your concern, and checking your device ID—XM5-9982-7A—it shows irregular patterns. [carefully] Have you been wearing it while sleeping? [more technically] Sometimes REM movement can trigger false readings, especially with firmware version 3.2.1.
1056 [concerned] That does sound unusual for resting metrics! [more focused] Let me check—your last sync was at 3:47 PM yesterday. [helpfully] Have you tried resetting the device by holding the button for exactly 15 seconds?
1057 [patiently] I understand your frustration completely! [more determined] I'm sending a diagnostic code—DG447B—to your app now. [encouragingly] Can you enter that in settings, then wait about 90 seconds for the analysis?
1058 [relieved] Perfect! That means the recalibration worked successfully. [informatively] I'm also issuing a 20% credit—code TRACK20—for your next purchase. [warmly] Is there anything else about your Model X-500 I can help with today?
1059 [professionally] Good afternoon, Pest Shield Services, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today? I see you're calling from—oh yes, the Johnson residence on Maple Street.
1060 [apologetically] Oh no, I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Mrs. Johnson. [more reassuringly] Our treatment comes with a thirty-day guarantee, so we'll absolutely send someone back. [briskly] Let me just pull up your file here... when works best for you?
1061 [sympathetically] I completely understand the urgency. [more quickly] Let me check our schedule—we have... actually, Tom can squeeze you in between three and five today. [confidently] He's our senior technician, specializes in persistent ant colonies.
1062 [thoughtfully] Sometimes ants switch their food preferences seasonally—protein versus sugar. [more animated] Tom will bring our full arsenal this time, different gel baits, granules, the works. [reassuringly] We'll identify the species and hit them with exactly what they're craving.
1063 [quickly] Absolutely no additional charges, it's all covered under your initial service warranty. [more emphatically] Tom will also do a full perimeter check—sometimes we find new entry points that weren't visible before. [professionally] Would you like him to call when he's on his way?
1064 [sympathetically] Oh, that's so frustrating, losing food on top of everything else. [briskly] I'm making detailed notes for Tom right now—kitchen priority, check pantry area thoroughly. [reassuringly] He'll also leave extra bait stations in problem zones, no charge.
1065 [confidently] Absolutely, and that's exactly why we're sending Tom. [enthusiastically] He's been with us twelve years, has this methodical approach—checks everything from foundation cracks to, [chuckles] even dishwasher connections. Really thorough guy.
1066 [helpfully] Just clear under the sink if you can, give Tom access to baseboards. [more casually] Don't worry about deep cleaning—actually, leaving a few ants visible helps him track their trails. [quickly] Oh, and pet bowls should be picked up during treatment.
1067 [apologetically] I'm really sorry you were given that impression. [more honestly] Sometimes it does take one visit, but persistent colonies, especially in spring—they can be tricky. [briskly] I'm also adding a note for Tom to inspect neighboring units for source colonies.
1068 [reassuringly] He definitely will, and if it is from neighboring property, we can coordinate treatment. [quickly] I've scheduled you for three to five, Tom Rodriguez will call thirty minutes before arrival. [helpfully] Is this still the best number to reach you?
1069 [Disappointed] Oh, come on, I'm only—wait, is that really gray or is it just the light? [Tsk] I mean, I guess it was gonna happen eventually, but still.
1070 [Happy] Finally! [Laugh] My sister's been going gray since twenty-five and she kept saying I was some kind of, like, genetic freak or something.
1071 [Whisper] Nobody needs to know about this, right? [Fast] I'm just gonna pluck it real quick and we'll pretend it never happened.
1072 [Angry] This is your fault! [Shout] You stress me out so much that I'm literally—look at this!
1073 [Sarcastic] Oh great, just what I needed today. [Sigh] As if the wrinkles weren't enough of a reminder.
1074 [Slow] You know what, I'm actually kinda... proud of it? [Chuckle] Like I've earned this little silver badge or something.
1075 [Fast] [Disappointed] I don't have time for this—I've got that reunion next week and now I gotta book a hair appointment and everything.
1076 [Sad] Mom had her first gray at my age too. [Slow] [Sigh] God, I miss being able to call her about stuff like this.
1077 [Happy] [Shout] Babe, come look at this! I'm officially distinguished now!
1078 [Whisper] [Fast] Okay so, um, hypothetically, if someone were to use their partner's hair dye without asking, would that be, like, a big deal?
1079 [Angry] Twenty-eight. [Tsk] [Slow] I'm twenty-eight years old and my body's already giving up on me.
1080 [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Well, at least now I can start lying about my age in the other direction, right?
1081 [Disappointed] But I just started that new vitamin routine that was supposed to—ugh, what's even the point? [Groan]
1082 [Happy] [Fast] Wait till Dad sees this—he always said I got Mom's genes and wouldn't go gray till fifty!
1083 [Sad] [Whisper] I thought I'd have more time before... before I started looking like him, you know?
1084 [Chuckle] Does this mean I get the senior discount at the movies now, or do I need, like, more than one?
1085 [Angry] [Fast] No no no, this is not—I literally just got carded at the bar last week! [Groan] This makes no sense!
1086 [Slow] [Sarcastic] Wow, nature's really subtle with the whole "you're not young anymore" message, isn't it?
1087 [Disappointed] I was gonna—actually, you know what, forget the gym membership. [Tsk] [Sad] Apparently, I'm aging no matter what I do.
1088 [Happy] [Slow] Honestly? Kinda makes me feel like a real adult for once, like I've finally, um, crossed some invisible threshold or whatever.
1089 SCENARIO: Upset about a condescending coworker, then hears from others they were just having a bad day
1090 I know, I know it's been a while, but like—come on, you know how crazy work's been. I literally haven't had time to breathe, and now you're mad because I needed a favor?
1091 That's not—okay, that's not true. I don't always need something. Sometimes I just... [sigh] look, I reached out, didn't I? Isn't that what matters?
1092 Yeah, fine, I needed your truck, but I also wanted to see you! Those things aren't like, mutually exclusive. You're acting like I'm using you or something.
1093 Wow. Okay. That's—that's really what you think of me? After everything? I mean, seriously, I've been your friend for eight years and suddenly I'm just some user because I'm bad at texting?
1094 Your birth—come on, that's not fair. You know I'm terrible with dates, I forget my own mom's birthday half the time. [frustrated laugh] That doesn't mean I don't care about you.
1095 Look look, I get it, okay? I'm a shitty friend sometimes. But you're not exactly reaching out either, y'know? It's not all on me to maintain this whole thing.
1096 You stopped—okay, so you just gave up? Without even telling me there was a problem? That's kinda unfair, don't you think? I'm not a mind reader.
1097 I mean... fine, maybe recently it's been—but that's just because I've been drowning, honestly. And I thought friends were supposed to help each other out when things get rough. Guess I was wrong about that.
1098 And I've helped you! Remember when you needed someone to watch your dog for two weeks? Or when I drove you to the airport at like 4am? I didn't—[scoff] I've been there for you too.
1099 Okay okay, so what, there's like a statute of limitations on friendship now? I'm sorry I haven't been great lately, I am, but you're basically telling me I'm worthless as a friend and that's... that hurts too, y'know?
1100 Oh yeah? How'd it—wait, why do you look so weird right now? Like, you're either about to tell me you failed or you, like, aced it completely.
1101 WHAT? No no no, wait—perfect? Like, actually perfect? Not just an A, but like... hundred percent perfect? [Gasp] Oh my god, which exam was this?
1102 Stop it. Stop—you're joking. Nobody gets perfect on Morrison's orgo exam. He literally, he literally prides himself on that. I heard the average is like, what, sixty-something?
1103 And you just—okay, okay, how are you being so calm about this? I'd be like, screaming right now. Actually, I kinda am screaming for you? This is huge!
1104 Just an—no. Nope. That's not "just" anything, that's like... you realize you probably made Morrison question his entire teaching philosophy, right? [Laugh] He's gonna make the next one impossible now.
1105 Wait, you haven't—oh man, your mom's gonna absolutely lose it. In the best way. She's gonna tell literally everyone she knows. The mailman's gonna hear about this.
1106 Okay but like... you worked so hard for this? Remember when you were basically living in the library? I was actually—I was getting worried about you, honestly.
1107 You guess? You—[Sigh] okay, you're doing that thing where you pretend stuff doesn't matter when it obviously does. Which is fine, but like, can we at least celebrate a little?
1108 Pizza? That's—I mean yeah, obviously yes to pizza, but this is like, champagne-worthy? Or at least that fancy place downtown you never wanna go to?
1109 Oh, big spender now! Okay okay, fine, pizza it is. But I'm gonna tell everyone there that you're a genius, just so you know. The whole restaurant's gonna know about this perfect score.
1110 SCENARIO: attempting to find the end of the packing tape
1111 [quietly seething] Don't remind me. [explosive] Every lead, every witness, every piece of evidence just—vanishes! [voice cracking] Like we're chasing smoke while this psycho keeps playing games with us.
1112 [dark chuckle] Yes! [increasingly unhinged] Burn it all! The forensics that led nowhere, the alibis that checked out, [screaming] the security footage that mysteriously corrupted! It's all garbage!
1113 [hollow laugh] My favorite part? [building rage] The DNA evidence that matches nobody in any database, anywhere, ever. [whispered fury] It's like our killer doesn't even exist in reality.
1114 [hysterical laughter] And the victims! [more controlled] No connection whatsoever—different ages, backgrounds, locations. [punch sound] The only pattern is that there IS no pattern! How's that for investigative brilliance?
1115 [skeptical grunt] Great, so instead of incompetent, we're just [sarcastically cheerful] dancing puppets in some mastermind's show? [serious whisper] That's supposed to make me feel better about destroying six months of work?
1116 [long pause] You're saying... [disbelief] Are you seriously suggesting this is an inside job? [nervous laugh] That someone in the department is orchestrating this whole nightmare?
1117 [dawning horror] The Patterson witness. [shaky voice] She only told us her location. [stronger] Two hours later, she was dead. Nobody else knew where we stashed her.
1118 [defeated whisper] So we've been sabotaging ourselves this whole time. [bitter laugh] Fighting with both hands tied because the enemy's been [voice breaking] sitting next to us in briefings.
1119 [cautious hope] The rage room session actually helped then? [dry humor] Instead of career suicide, we just [thoughtfully] stripped away the camouflage by destroying their carefully crafted distractions?
1120 [resolved exhale] Agreed. [darkly amused] Let them think we've lost it, gone crazy from dead ends. [ice cold] Meanwhile, we'll be watching everyone who's been watching us fail.
1121 [cheerfully] Thank you for contacting RoboVac support! [sympathetic tone] I see your device serial number RV3X-889214 in our system. [reassuringly] This mapping confusion happens sometimes when—well—reflective surfaces like mirrors interfere with the sensors.
1122 [apologetically] Oh dear, that's quite the discrepancy. [in a professional tone] Could you please check if firmware version 4.2.1 is installed? [helpfully] You'll find it under Settings, then About, then scroll down to—actually, there should be eight digits there.
1123 [slightly nervous] Ah, the beta version, yes. [quickly] That shouldn't have been pushed to consumer units. [more calmly] Let me escalate this to ticket number TK-20241108-5543, and we'll need to roll back your firmware immediately.
1124 [concerned] That's... highly unusual. [thoughtfully] The GPS module might be experiencing interference. [more firmly] Please power cycle the unit by holding the home button for exactly 15 seconds, not 14, not 16.
1125 [sympathetically] I'm terribly sorry about this experience. [decisively] I'm authorizing a replacement unit, reference code RPL-99087-DELTA. [warmly] Your new RoboVac should arrive within 3-5 business days to your registered address.
1126 [brightly] Good morning, Daily Tribune customer service, how can I help you today? [quickly] I see you're calling from the account registered to—oh, let me just pull that up for you.
1127 [apologetically] Oh, I completely understand your frustration, sir. [speaking rapidly] Let me check your delivery route right away—I'm seeing here that you're on Route 47, is that correct? [reassuring] We'll definitely get this sorted out.
1128 [sympathetically] That's absolutely not acceptable, you're right. [more briskly] I'm flagging this immediately for our delivery supervisor, and—actually, can you tell me, [quickly] has this been the same carrier each time?
1129 [firmly] Right, I'm documenting all of this now. [speaking faster] We can offer you a credit for the missed deliveries, and I'm scheduling a supervisor to personally monitor your delivery tomorrow morning, [reassuring] would that work?
1130 [more apologetically] I see you've called before—oh my, twice last month. [determinedly] Listen, I'm escalating this directly to regional management, not just the local supervisor, [quickly] and putting a priority flag on your account.
1131 [earnestly] Absolutely, that's the basic service you're paying for. [speaking rapidly] I'm also adding a note that if tomorrow's delivery isn't perfect, we'll switch you to a different carrier immediately, [pause] no more chances.
1132 [quickly] Yes, we have backup carriers specifically for situations like this. [more reassuringly] Plus, I'm issuing you a full month's credit right now—you'll see it on your next statement, [firmly] that's our guarantee.
1133 [confidently] Exactly right, and I'm personally monitoring this ticket. [speaking briskly] You'll also get a follow-up call tomorrow afternoon to confirm everything went smoothly, [pause] is this the best number to reach you?
1134 [warmly] That's what I'm here for, and honestly, three weeks of bad service is three weeks too many. [quickly] I'm sending you a confirmation email right now with everything we discussed, [reassuring] including my direct extension.
1135 [firmly] It will be there, I promise you that. [speaking rapidly] Six AM, on your porch, dry and intact, and if not, [more determinedly] I'll personally ensure you get that carrier change immediately.
1136 [Slow] So, um, I know I'm usually the one who—look, this is really hard for me to say, but I think I need some help here. [Sigh]
1137 [Fast] [Angry] I can't believe I'm even having to do this, okay, but everything's falling apart and I just—I can't handle it alone anymore!
1138 [Whisper] Hey, could you maybe, like, not tell anyone about this? [Tsk] I've got a bit of a situation and I dunno who else to ask.
1139 [Sarcastic] Oh great, here I am, the person who never needs anything from anybody, about to beg for—[Sigh] yeah, I need a favor.
1140 [Happy] You know what, screw my pride, I'm just gonna say it—can you help me out? [Laugh] This is actually kinda liberating!
1141 [Disappointed] I, uh, I really thought I could handle this myself, y'know? [Slow] Guess I was wrong about that.
1142 [Sad] [Whisper] Mom always said I was too stubborn to ask for—well, here I am, asking.
1143 [Fast] Okay so basically I've been trying to fix this thing for like three hours and it's just—can you please just come look at it? [Groan]
1144 [Shout] Fine! You win! [Angry] I need help, alright? Are you happy now?
1145 [Slow] This is, er, this is new territory for me, but would you mind if I—actually, could you possibly lend me some money? [Tsk]
1146 [Chuckle] I literally cannot believe the words about to come out of my mouth right now. [Fast] I need help, there, I said it!
1147 [Disappointed] [Sigh] Remember when I said I'd never need anyone's help with anything ever again? Yeah, about that...
1148 [Sarcastic] [Slow] So apparently being independent and self-sufficient has its limits—who knew, right?
1149 [Sad] I'm kinda drowning here and I just—[Whisper] I don't know what else to do anymore.
1150 [Happy] [Fast] Wait, you actually wanna help me? Like, you're not gonna make fun of me for asking? [Laugh]
1151 [Angry] Look, I wouldn't be here if I had literally any other option, but I don't, so—[Groan] can you help or not?
1152 [Slow] You're probably gonna think less of me for this, but, um, I sort of need someone to talk to about—about everything. [Sigh]
1153 [Whisper] [Fast] Before I lose my nerve, I gotta ask you something and please don't judge me, okay?
1154 [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] Ten years of "I got this" and here I am, hat in hand, asking for—yeah, this is exactly as awkward as I imagined.
1155 [Shout] I don't care anymore! [Happy] I need help and I'm not ashamed to—okay, maybe a little ashamed, but whatever! [Laugh]
1156 SCENARIO: Calmly recounting a time they gave directions confidently, then thinking about it, then realizing they mixed up left and right, spiraling into direction-giving guilt
1157 Okay, so—don't freak out, but I don't exactly know where it is right now. I mean, I had it at the party, and then—look, I'm still trying to figure out what happened.
1158 I didn't—okay, technically yes, but it wasn't like I was being careless with it. Someone bumped into me on the dance floor and my purse just [groan] completely dumped everywhere. I picked up everything I could find, but it was dark and—
1159 I know, I know that, okay? You think I don't feel terrible about this? But honestly, you're acting like I just threw it in the trash or something. It was an accident—a really, really unfortunate accident.
1160 Um, excuse me? You said I could borrow it for the weekend. You didn't say "but don't actually wear it anywhere." That's—that's kinda the whole point of borrowing jewelry, isn't it?
1161 Oh, so now there's rules you didn't mention? Look look, I get that you're upset, but don't act like I'm some irresponsible person who doesn't care about your stuff. [scoff] I've been going back there every day looking for it.
1162 Yes, every day! What, you think I'm lying now? I literally called the venue three times, went through their entire lost and found twice—I'm doing everything I can here, and you're just... being really cold about this.
1163 It might not be—we don't know that for sure yet. And I'm gonna keep looking, obviously, but like... you're not even letting me properly apologize or—or anything. You're just shutting me down completely.
1164 Okay okay, fine. I lost it. [frustrated laugh] But you know what? Maybe—maybe you shouldn't have lent something that precious to anyone. I mean, if it was that important, why even risk it?
1165 And I—that's not fair. That's really not fair. One accident doesn't erase like five years of friendship. I've literally never lost anything of yours before, ever. But sure, make me the villain here.
1166 Yeah, well... me too. I wanted to give it back to you, believe it or not. And I'm still gonna try to find it, even though you're—whatever. [quieter] I know it meant a lot to you. It meant a lot that you trusted me with it, too.
1167 SCENARIO: discovering they grabbed the wrong coffee order
1168 [loud and excited] Mommy, that man has a really big belly! [giggles] Is there a baby in there like when you had my sister? [innocently] He looks like Santa but without the beard!
1169 [confused] But you said honesty is important! [matter-of-factly] And his nose has hair coming out. [thoughtfully slower] Grandpa has that too but he uses special scissors for it.
1170 [dismissively] The dog is okay but this man is more interesting. [curiously] Why does his face turn red like that? [getting louder] Is he angry? You turn red when you're angry too!
1171 [skeptically] There's no ice cream in the car, you're lying. [accusatory] You always lie when you're embarrassed! [brightly] Like when you farted at the grocery store and blamed it on me!
1172 [sympathetically] Don't be sad, Mommy. [helpfully] The man is smiling now! [enthusiastically] See, he thinks I'm funny! Can I tell him about when you cried watching that cartoon movie?
1173 [proudly] But my teacher says I'm observant! [dramatically] I notice everything! [whispered conspiracy] Like how you hide chocolate in your dresser drawer and eat it when we're sleeping.
1174 [indignantly] Why is it unfortunate? [slower, thinking] You said I'm special and unique! [building excitement] Oh! Should I tell him about your special cream for your wrinkles? The expensive one?
1175 [offended tone] It's not a phase! [firmly] I'm just good at noticing things. [brightening up] Like how that man's shirt has a stain that looks like a dinosaur! See it?
1176 [thoughtfully] Mommy, why are you being weird? [innocently questioning] The man is laughing! [delighted] He must like my observations! Should I tell him more things I noticed about him?
1177 [whispering loudly] Okay, but can I just say one more thing? [eagerly] His shoes are really shiny! [appreciatively] Much shinier than Daddy's. Daddy's shoes look old and sad.
1178 [professionally] I understand your frustration, sir. [apologetic] May I have your order number and the store location where you purchased them? We'll definitely look into this issue for you right away.
1179 [concerned] Let me pull that up... XK-4582-B. [pause] I see here the order was processed on November 15th. [more carefully] The system shows minus 2.75 left, minus 3.00 right, with astigmatism correction.
1180 [reassuring] Sir, I completely understand. [more firmly] We take prescription accuracy very seriously. Can you confirm your member ID? It should start with EYE, followed by seven digits.
1181 [apologetically] Thank you, Mr. Chen. [sincerely] I see your excellent history with us, and I'm truly sorry about this experience. [more helpfully] I can schedule you for an immediate re-examination tomorrow at 9 AM.
1182 [understanding] Absolutely, we can work with Dr. Matthews' prescription. [efficiently] If you email it to service@eyechain.com, reference case number TC-9923, we'll expedite new lenses within 24 hours, no charge.
1183 [reassuring] You'll keep the same frames, Mr. Chen. [warmly] We'll only replace the lenses, and actually, I'm adding a 40% discount code—COMP240—for your next purchase as an apology.
1184 [helpfully] Actually, our SoHo location at 155 Spring Street is much closer to you. [enthusiastically] They open at 8 AM, and with your case number, you'll have priority service.
1185 [surprised] Wait, did you say 7.25? [concerned] That's a significant difference! [more urgently] Mr. Chen, I'm escalating this to our quality control team immediately—that's a serious error.
1186 [seriously] You're absolutely right. [decisively] I'm documenting this as a critical incident, reference QC-1147. [more gently] We'll also provide temporary lenses while yours are being remade, no rental fee.
1187 [confidently] Absolutely, Mr. Chen. [reassuringly] I'm personally assigning this to our senior technician, badge number ST-4429. [warmly] You'll receive a confirmation email within the hour with all these details.
1188 [apologetically] Oh, I'm so sorry about that! [quickly] I thought the maintenance guy came by last week? [confused] Let me, uh, check my records here real quick.
1189 [defensive] Well, you know, it's been really hard to get contractors lately. [more quietly] Everyone's booked solid. [hurriedly] But I'll definitely call someone today, I promise.
1190 [concerned] Mold? Oh no, that's... that's not good at all. [briskly] Okay, forget the regular guy. [decisively] I'll call an emergency plumber right now, today, no excuses.
1191 [nervously] No, no, please don't do that! [quickly] I'll personally make sure someone comes today. [reassuring] Can you, maybe, send me photos of the damage so I can show them?
1192 [embarrassed] Right, yes, of course. [mumbling] Tuesday's messages... [more clearly] I found them! [apologetically] This is completely unacceptable, I know.
1193 [quickly] Here's what I'll do—I'm calling SafeGuard Plumbing right now. [confidently] They owe me a favor. [briskly] They'll be there before 5 PM today, guaranteed.
1194 [eagerly] Absolutely, yes! [rapidly] I'll send you their number, the appointment time, even the plumber's name. [more slowly] Everything will be in writing this time, I promise.
1195 [quickly] That won't be necessary! [nervous chuckle] Trust me, they'll be there. [reassuringly] I'm literally dialing them as we speak, right now.
1196 [apologetically] You're right, you're absolutely right. [sincerely] This should've been fixed two weeks ago. [quickly] I'm handling it now, properly this time.
1197 [nervously] Understood, completely understood! [rapidly] You'll get that confirmation text within the hour. [reassuring] Today's the day it gets fixed, I guarantee it.
1198 [Fast] Oh my god, they're literally at the door right now and I've got—the place is a disaster, there's takeout containers everywhere! [Groan]
1199 [Sarcastic] Sure, Mom, no problem, I definitely have three hours to discuss why I'm not married yet. [Tsk]
1200 [Whisper] Quick, hide the—actually, just throw everything in the closet, they're coming up the stairs! [Fast]
1201 [Happy] You know what, I actually kinda missed Dad's terrible jokes, even though I'd never admit it to him. [Chuckle]
1202 [Disappointed] I had plans tonight, like, actual plans for once, and now I'm gonna be stuck looking at vacation photos. [Sigh]
1203 [Slow] So apparently "I'll call before I come" means absolutely nothing in their universe, huh? [Sarcastic] [Tsk]
1204 [Angry] They can't just—I mean, I'm thirty-two years old and they still treat my apartment like it's, what, an extension of their house? [Groan]
1205 [Sad] I haven't seen them in six months and honestly, um, I don't even know what to say to them anymore. [Sigh]
1206 [Shout] The bathroom's not—don't go in there yet, I need five minutes! [Fast] Please!
1207 [Happy] Wait, did they bring the dog? [Laugh] Oh man, I haven't seen Buster in forever!
1208 [Whisper] If they ask about my job situation, I'm just gonna, like, pretend I didn't hear them, okay? [Sarcastic]
1209 [Disappointed] I was literally about to get in the shower and just—of course this is when they show up. [Slow] [Sigh]
1210 [Fast] Um, so basically my roommate's boyfriend is here and he's not wearing a shirt and this is gonna be really awkward. [Groan]
1211 [Angry] Twenty minutes notice would've been—I dunno—basic courtesy? [Shout] Is that too much to ask?
1212 [Chuckle] My mom's already rearranging my kitchen cabinets, because apparently I've been storing plates wrong for three years. [Sarcastic]
1213 [Sad] Every surprise visit starts with "we were just in the neighborhood," but they live four hours away, so... [Slow] [Tsk]
1214 [Happy] Actually, you know what, forget cleaning—let's just order pizza and pretend we're normal people for once! [Laugh] [Fast]
1215 [Whisper] Don't mention the breakup, don't mention the breakup, don't mention—oh god, Mom's got that look. [Disappointed] [Sigh]
1216 [Slow] I love them, right, but sometimes I wish love came with, er, some kind of scheduling app or something. [Chuckle]
1217 [Angry] This is the third "spontaneous" visit this month, and I'm starting to think they're, like, checking up on me or whatever. [Disappointed] [Groan]
1218 SCENARIO: Upset about a critical comment from their parent, then rethinks it and sees the caring behind it
1219 I—okay, I know how this looks, but just let me explain, please? I was gonna go to my mom's, I really was, but then—um, something came up and I just... I didn't wanna worry you.
1220 Oh god. Oh no no no, this is—wait, let me just—[nervous laugh] I can explain that. I mean, I was downtown, yeah, but it's not what you're thinking, I swear.
1221 I dunno, that I—that I was avoiding you or doing something sketchy? But I wasn't! I was actually—okay this is gonna sound so stupid, but I was meeting with that therapist you recommended. The one on Third Street?
1222 Because I was—I was embarrassed, okay? You've been telling me to go for months and I kept saying I didn't need it and then suddenly I'm like, sneaking around to appointments like some kind of... I don't know. [Sigh] It's stupid, I know it's stupid.
1223 I know, I know! That's—that's even worse, right? God, I'm such an idiot. I just didn't want you to make a big deal about it, y'know? Like "oh finally you're listening to me" or whatever. Which is so dumb because you wouldn't even—you're not like that.
1224 No, you're not, and I—I knew that. I think I was just... honestly? I was scared. Like what if I went and it didn't help or what if they told me something I didn't wanna hear, and I just... I wanted to figure it out first before telling anyone.
1225 Especially you. No wait—that came out wrong. I mean, your opinion matters the most, so if it went badly I didn't want you to—ugh, I'm explaining this so badly. [Groan] You matter the most, that's why I was scared to tell you.
1226 I know it doesn't! Nothing I did makes sense, okay? I panicked and I lied and I—I hate that I lied to you. Like genuinely, it's been eating at me all week. I almost told you like five different times but then I'd already lied so it got harder and harder to—
1227 Um, three weeks? Maybe four? I'm sorry, I should've just—I should've told you from the beginning. You've been nothing but supportive and I basically threw that in your face by lying about something so... so nothing, y'know?
1228 Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I guess I'm still—I'm working through some stuff. But that's not an excuse for lying to you. I'm really, really sorry. Like I know I keep saying that but I don't—I don't know what else to say except I promise I won't do it again. No more lies, even stupid ones.
1229 Oh god, okay—I didn't yell, exactly. I just—she was jumping and I kinda raised my voice? But like, not in a mean way, I swear.
1230 Wait, what? No no no, that's—I didn't mean to scare her! I was just startled when she jumped on me with muddy paws and I—[groan] I'm such an idiot.
1231 I know, I know. Listen, I've never really been good with dogs? That's not an excuse though, I shouldn't have—she's literally just being friendly and I totally overreacted.
1232 Which makes it worse! God, I feel terrible. She was just—she was being sweet and I ruined it. I basically rejected the sweetest dog in the world. [nervous laugh] I'm actually the worst person.
1233 You did, you totally did, and I just—I forgot in the moment? No, that's not—I wasn't thinking. I just reacted and... um, can I apologize to her? Would that be weird?
1234 I dunno, treats? Belly rubs? I'll literally sit on the floor and let her jump on me with the muddiest paws ever if that's what it takes. I wanna make this right.
1235 Yeah, I—I get it. It's about you too, and how I just... I disrespected something you love. Someone you love. That's—that's really messed up of me.
1236 I know she is. And I treated her like—like some annoying animal instead of your family member. [sigh] I'm really, really sorry. To both of you.
1237 Wait, really? You're gonna—you're gonna let me try again? Oh thank god, yes, absolutely. The organic ones from that fancy pet store downtown, right? I'll get like three bags.
1238 Yeah, okay, that's—that's fair. I'll be super calm, I promise. Like zen meditation calm. She won't even recognize me, I'll be so chill. Thank you for giving me another chance, seriously.
1239 SCENARIO: debating whether to ask for directions or keep trying
1240 [cheerfully] So, kiddo, how was school today? [getting quieter] I made your favorite—well, what I think is your favorite—lasagna. [nervous laugh] Your dad mentioned you liked Italian food, so I thought we could try this family recipe together.
1241 [apologetically] Oh, I didn't realize! Next time I'll use ricotta, I promise. [more eagerly] Maybe you could even show me how she made it? [soft] We could cook together on weekends, make it a fun tradition.
1242 [hurt] I'm trying here, really. [steadier] Your father wants us to be a family, and so do I. [pleading] Can't we at least have one peaceful meal without you comparing everything to how it used to be?
1243 [firmly] Sit down. We're eating together. [gentler] I know this is hard, I lost my mom young too. [carefully] But pushing everyone away won't bring her back, and it's hurting your dad to see this.
1244 [quietly] You're right. I'm sorry. [Long exhale] That was inappropriate of me. [measured] I just want you to know that I'm not trying to replace anyone—I couldn't even if I wanted to. I'm just me.
1245 [hopefully] Small victories, right? [warming up] I keep a notebook, actually—your likes, dislikes, allergies. [self-conscious laugh] Super weird, I know, but I wanted to get something right for once with you.
1246 [gently] Different can be okay though, can't it? [more confident] I make terrible dad jokes, burn pancakes every Sunday, and [chuckle] sing off-key in the shower. But I also love your father and care about you immensely.
1247 [curious] Then let's have one now. [earnest] What matters to you? Besides hating my lasagna and my existence in this house. [lightly] I'm genuinely asking—what would make this easier? What do you need from me here?
1248 [relieved laugh] Noted—less panic, more chill. [thoughtfully] Though you did hide my car keys last week, so the rebellion theory wasn't completely unfounded. [warmer] How about we establish some boundaries? You tell me what's off-limits.
1249 [amused] Even burned ones? [sincerely] Deal on all counts, especially the bonus mom thing—[shudder]—that phrase makes me cringe too. [gentle] How about we just be... people who share a house and occasionally burnt breakfast food?
1250 [quietly] Mrs. Thompson, I am... I'm deeply sorry for your loss. [more gently] Whiskers was patient ID number W-4829, correct? [pause] Can you tell me what happened after you took her home on Tuesday?
1251 [defensive] The radiographs we took showed no immediate obstruction, Mrs. Thompson. [more carefully] Sometimes cardiac issues can present similarly to respiratory—[sighs deeply] I understand you're upset, but we followed standard protocol.
1252 [firmly] Each case is different, and I can't discuss other patients' records. [more sympathetically] But regarding Whiskers, based on her symptoms that day—lethargy, occasional cough—hairball was the most likely diagnosis. [softer] Did she show any other signs before Tuesday?
1253 [apologetically] Mrs. Thompson, I'm not blaming you at all, you were—you've always been an excellent pet parent. [steadier] Would you like to schedule a meeting to review Whiskers' complete medical history? [gently] Sometimes that helps with closure.
1254 [professionally] I understand your frustration, and you have every right to file a complaint if you feel it's necessary. [more earnestly] However, I'd really appreciate the chance to review everything with you first—perhaps Thursday at 2 PM? [quietly] We could also discuss the refund then.
1255 [somberly] She absolutely did deserve the best care, and I'm sorry we fell short. [more clearly] I'll have Michelle prepare all records from January 1st through present, about 47 pages total. [pause] Everything will be ready for Thursday's meeting.
1256 [reassuringly] You're right, we did have that documentation issue in March, but it was corrected the same week. [more confidently] I personally reviewed her complete file this morning, including lab results from Quest Diagnostics, reference number QD-889234. [gently] Everything is there.
1257 [compassionately] Mrs. Thompson, second-guessing won't bring Whiskers back, though I—I understand the impulse completely. [more softly] Emily must be heartbroken. [pause] Would it help if I wrote her a letter about what a special cat Whiskers was?
1258 [warmly] She was one of my favorite patients, truly—so gentle and trusting. [more seriously] And Mrs. Thompson, regardless of reviews or complaints, I genuinely want to understand what happened. [firmly] That's what matters most to me right now.
1259 [understandingly] Conference room B, yes, and please don't worry about being emotional—you lost a family member. [more gently] I'll block out extra time, until 3:30 PM at least. [softly] We'll go through everything together, I promise you that, Mrs. Thompson.
1260 [briskly] Thank you for calling QuickShip Delivery, this is Rachel speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today?
1261 [apologetic] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, let me pull up your tracking information right away. [quickly] Can I get your tracking number, please?
1262 [professionally] Perfect, I see it here—one moment while I check the driver's notes. [more briskly] Okay, so it shows the driver arrived at 2:47 PM and, um, no answer at the door.
1263 [calmly] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [more quickly] Sometimes drivers are on tight schedules and don't wait as long as they should. [reassuring] Let me see what options we have for redelivery.
1264 [regretfully] Unfortunately, the sender specifically requested signature confirmation, so we can't override that. [briskly] But I can schedule a specific two-hour window tomorrow, or—or you could pick it up at our facility tonight before eight.
1265 [quickly] Absolutely, I'm adding a note right now—"must ring doorbell and wait minimum sixty seconds." [cheerfully] For tomorrow, we have eight to ten AM, ten to twelve, or two to four PM available.
1266 [confidently] I'm marking this as priority delivery with supervisor oversight, so yes, I can personally ensure delivery within that window. [more quickly] You'll also get a text when the driver is thirty minutes away.
1267 [sympathetically] Trust me, I hear you—it's usually for insurance purposes or seller preference. [more briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this delivery or any other packages?
1268 [reassuringly] After three attempts, packages typically go to our hold facility for five business days. [quickly] But with the priority flag I've added, that won't happen—supervisors monitor these deliveries personally.
1269 [warmly] That's very kind of you to say, thank you. [briskly] You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with your delivery window and my direct extension if any issues arise. [professionally] Is there anything else today?
1270 [Angry] [Fast] Oh come ON, the speed limit is forty-five, not—not twenty, for crying out loud!
1271 [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, take your time, it's not like some of us have, um, actual places to be today. [Tsk]
1272 [Disappointed] [Sigh] I should've just taken the back roads, I mean, this always happens on this stretch.
1273 [Whisper] Please turn, please turn, please just—okay, they're not turning. [Groan]
1274 [Happy] [Laugh] You know what, this is so ridiculous it's actually kinda funny at this point.
1275 [Shout] The left lane is for PASSING, not for your Sunday cruise! [Angry]
1276 [Sad] [Slow] I'm gonna lose this job if I'm late again, and it's not even—I left so early...
1277 [Fast] [Disappointed] My boss literally said "don't be late" and here I am stuck behind grandpa going, what, fifteen miles an hour?
1278 [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Oh good, now they're slowing down even more, that's—that's exactly what I needed right now.
1279 [Angry] I swear, if I miss my daughter's recital because of this—ugh, I can't even... [Groan]
1280 [Whisper] [Tsk] Okay, deep breaths, it's just, um, it's just five more minutes, maybe ten, you're fine.
1281 [Happy] [Fast] Oh thank god, there's a passing zone coming up in, like, half a mile!
1282 [Slow] [Sigh] This is karma, isn't it, for all the times I've been the slow driver?
1283 [Shout] [Angry] Are you SERIOUSLY braking on a straight road right now?!
1284 [Disappointed] You know, I actually woke up early to avoid this exact—this exact situation, so... [Tsk]
1285 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, twenty-two in a fifty zone, we're really breaking speed records today, aren't we?
1286 [Sad] [Whisper] Please don't let them notice I'm late, please don't let them—oh, who am I kidding?
1287 [Fast] Is that—are they actually on their PHONE right now?! [Angry] [Shout] Unbelievable!
1288 [Chuckle] I mean, honestly, at this rate I might as well just, um, call in sick or something. [Disappointed]
1289 [Happy] [Laugh] [Fast] YES, finally, they're turning off, oh my god, freedom at last!
