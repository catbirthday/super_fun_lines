Character 1: So. Got approved for the mortgage.

335 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, you got approved? That's huge! I mean, that's literally huge! When did you find out?

Character 1: This morning. Email came through at 9:47.

336 Character 2: The specificity! [Laugh] Okay but like, how are you feeling? Because this is—I mean, you're gonna be a homeowner! That's kinda wild, right?

Character 1: Yeah. Wild.

337 Character 2: Um, okay, you don't sound—are you not excited? Because like, I'm basically vibrating for you right now and you're giving me nothing here.

Character 1: It's a lot of money. A lot.

338 Character 2: Oh no no no, don't—don't do that thing where you spiral about the numbers. Everyone freaks about the numbers. It's like, it's totally normal to be scared, y'know?

Character 1: Three hundred thousand dollars. For thirty years.

339 Character 2: Okay but—[Sigh] listen, you did the math, right? Like a million times? And the bank literally just said yes, you can do this, so...

Character 1: Banks make mistakes.

340 Character 2: Stop it! You're not—this isn't a mistake. You've been saving for like, what, five years? Six? That down payment didn't just appear outta nowhere.

Character 1: Six and a half. But who's counting.

341 Character 2: See? See, there's that—okay that was almost a joke. We're making progress. But seriously, which place was it? The one with the—the weird purple bathroom?

Character 1: Blue. But yeah, that one.

342 Character 2: Blue, purple, whatever—point is, you loved that place! I mean, you literally wouldn't shut up about the kitchen. Well, okay, you mentioned it twice, which for you is basically gushing.

Character 1: The kitchen is nice.

343 Character 2: It's gonna be YOUR kitchen though! Like you can—I dunno, paint it black if you want. Install those pretentious coffee machines you like. [Chuckle] Nobody can stop you.

Character 1: Espresso machines aren't pretentious. They're practical.

344 Character 2: Uh-huh, sure sure. But like—okay, real talk? I'm really, really proud of you. This is scary but it's also... y'know, it's amazing. You're doing it.

Script: 020664fb_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. The scans came back.

345 Character 2: Oh my god, okay—wait, are you gonna make me guess or are you just gonna—actually no, your face, something's different. Tell me tell me tell me.

Character 1: It's working. The treatment. It's actually working.

346 Character 2: I'm sorry, what? Did you just—[Gasp] oh my god. Oh my GOD. That's—holy shit, that's incredible! How much, like, how much is it working?

Character 1: Forty percent reduction. In three months.

347 Character 2: Forty—okay that's, that's huge though, right? Like the doctors, they must be—wait, what did they actually say? Are they like, freaking out? Because I'm freaking out right now.

Character 1: They seemed pleased. Used the word "encouraging."

348 Character 2: Encouraging? That's—no no no, that's doctor speak for "this is fucking amazing," you know that right? They never get excited about anything. When do you go back?

Character 1: Two weeks. More tests.

349 Character 2: Okay so we're—we're celebrating, right? Like, this is a thing we celebrate? I mean, I know you're all... you, about this stuff, but come on. [Softer] This is good news, babe.

Character 1: I don't want to jinx it.

350 Character 2: Oh, honey. No—that's not, that's not how this works. You can't jinx science, okay? The cells don't care if we get tacos and champagne tonight.

Character 1: Tacos and champagne. Really.

351 Character 2: Um, yes? It's called class, look it up. But seriously though, how are you—like, how are you actually feeling about all this? Because you seem kinda... I dunno, quiet? Even for you.

Character 1: I didn't think it would work. I'd already made peace with... yeah.

352 Character 2: Oh. Oh, babe. That's—[Sigh] okay, that makes total sense actually. You were protecting yourself, weren't you? And now it's like—wait, now what, right?

Character 1: Exactly. Now what.

353 Character 2: Well, now you—you get to hope again? I mean, I know that's terrifying as hell, but like... you get to think about next year. Next summer. That trip to Portland we kept saying we'd do.

Character 1: Portland. Haven't thought about Portland in months.

354 Character 2: Well start thinking about it, because I'm—we're going, okay? And that's not me being, like, toxically positive or whatever. That's me saying your treatment is working and we're gonna eat so many donuts. So many.

Script: 4aca1924_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Got my visa.

355 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, you got it? When did you find out? I thought you said it was gonna take like another month or something!

Character 1: This morning. Email came through at 6 AM.

356 Character 2: And you're just now telling me? That's—that's huge! [Gasp] Holy shit, you're actually going. Like, this is really happening, huh?

Character 1: Yeah. Still processing it.

357 Character 2: Okay okay, I mean—of course you are. It's like, it's a lot, y'know? How long did the whole thing take? Because I remember you started this whole process like... what, six months ago?

Character 1: Eight months. Eight very long months.

358 Character 2: Eight—Jesus. That's basically a whole pregnancy. Except instead of a baby you get... um, paperwork and the right to live somewhere? [Chuckle] Sorry, that was a weird comparison.

Character 1: Accurate though.

359 Character 2: So when do you—like, when are you actually gonna go? Do you have to leave right away or can you kinda, y'know, take your time with it?

Character 1: Three months to enter. Then I can figure things out.

360 Character 2: Three months is... I mean, that's not nothing but it's also not—shit, that's gonna go by so fast. Are you excited? Scared? Both? I'd be absolutely losing my mind right now, honestly.

Character 1: Mostly just tired.

361 Character 2: Yeah, no, that—that makes sense. You've been in limbo for so long, right? Like constantly waiting and checking your email and just... [Sigh] the stress of not knowing must've been exhausting.

Character 1: You have no idea. I checked that portal every day. Sometimes twice.

362 Character 2: Oh babe, I—actually I kinda do have an idea because you've been talking about literally nothing else for months. Not that I'm complaining! I'm just saying, like, I could see how much it was eating at you.

Character 1: Sorry. I know I was obsessive.

363 Character 2: No no no, don't—don't apologize. That's not what I meant at all. I just... I'm really, really happy for you, y'know? You fought so hard for this.

Character 1: Thanks. I'm gonna miss you.

364 Character 2: Okay well now—now you're gonna make me cry. [Laugh] We're not saying goodbye yet, alright? We've got three whole months to be disgustingly sentimental. Save it.

Script: 76853d8f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I had to turn down three orders yesterday.

365 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you're turning down orders? That's like—that's actually amazing though, right? I mean, kinda stressful but also... wow.

Character 1: Can't keep up. Might need to hire someone.

366 Character 2: Oh my god, yes yes yes! You're gonna be like, an actual boss now! With employees and everything! [Laugh] Sorry, I'm just—this is so exciting, you've worked so hard for this.

Character 1: It's just one person. Maybe.

367 Character 2: No no no, don't downplay it! This is huge! Like, remember when you were worried nobody would even want your stuff? And now you literally can't make it fast enough?

Character 1: Yeah. Weird how fast things changed.

368 Character 2: How are you even—like, are you sleeping? Eating? Because I know how you get when you're busy, you just kinda... forget to be human.

Character 1: Coffee counts as a meal, right?

369 Character 2: Um, absolutely not. That's—no. [Groan] Okay, I'm bringing you actual food tomorrow. Non-negotiable.

Character 1: The kitchen table's covered in orders. So's the couch.

370 Character 2: The couch too? Oh man, you're really—you're basically living in a workshop now, huh? Have you thought about maybe getting like, an actual space? A studio or something?

Character 1: Commercial rent's expensive.

371 Character 2: Yeah but like, if you're turning down orders... I mean, honestly? Sounds like you could probably swing it. Plus your back's gonna hate you if you keep working on the floor.

Character 1: My back already hates me.

372 Character 2: See? See, this is what I'm—[Sigh] you gotta take care of yourself, babe. The business won't run if you break.

Character 1: I know. It's just... a lot.

373 Character 2: Of course it is! You went from like, zero to sixty in what—two months? That's insane! But also, y'know, really really incredible.

Character 1: Sometimes I miss when it was just a hobby.

374 Character 2: Oh honey, I get that. I really do. But like—okay, remember how happy you were with your first paying customer? That joy's still there, it's just... buried under invoices right now.

Script: 93620803_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You knew Jake was going to be there.

375 Character 2: I—okay, I wasn't totally sure he was gonna show up. Like, Marcus mentioned maybe he'd come but it wasn't—it wasn't definite, you know? I should've told you anyway, I know that now.

Character 1: You let me walk in there blind.

376 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, I guess I did but I swear I thought about texting you like fifty times. I just kept thinking maybe he wouldn't actually come and then—[groan]—then it wouldn't matter, right?

Character 1: Right. Because seeing my ex with his new girlfriend doesn't matter.

377 Character 2: That's not what I meant! God, I'm—I'm so bad at this. I wanted to protect you, okay? Like I thought if I told you, you wouldn't come and you've been looking forward to Marcus's party for weeks and I just—I dunno, I convinced myself it would be fine.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

378 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right and I—honestly, I've been feeling sick about it since I saw your face when you walked in. The way you just froze and then looked at me like—[nervous laugh]—like you wanted to kill me, which, fair.

Character 1: I had to find out from Emma. Emma, of all people.

379 Character 2: Oh god, Emma told you? That's—wait, what did she say? Actually, never mind, doesn't matter. I should've been the one to warn you, I get that. I really really messed up here.

Character 1: You've known for how long?

380 Character 2: Um, like... three days? Maybe four? Marcus told me on Tuesday and I kept—I kept picking up my phone to text you but then I'd chicken out because I didn't wanna be the one to ruin your week, you know?

Character 1: So instead you ruined my night. In public.

381 Character 2: I know, I know. That's so much worse, I see that now. I just—I'm really bad at delivering bad news and I thought maybe, I dunno, maybe you guys could coexist or something? [sigh] I'm an idiot.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

382 Character 2: I wanna fix this. Like, tell me what to do and I'll do it. You want me to—to never talk to Marcus again? Or like, I could make sure you know about every single social event from now on, even the maybes?

Character 1: I just wanted a heads up. That's literally all.

383 Character 2: And that's—that's the bare minimum, right? Like the absolute least I could do as your friend and I couldn't even... god, I'm so sorry. You deserved to know. You deserved to make your own choice about it.

Character 1: Next time just tell me. Even if it sucks.

384 Character 2: I will. I promise I will. No more—no more deciding what's best for you or trying to protect you from stuff. Just straight up honesty from now on, even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard, actually.

385 SCENARIO: realizing they forgot their work badge

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I'm, um— I'm at the door, and I need my— where's my badge? My work badge. I always, uh, I always clip it right here on my— [sigh] it's not there.

[slightly panicked]

Wait wait wait, did I— did I leave it at home? I feel like I, um, I feel like I grabbed it this morning, but maybe I just— maybe I just thought about grabbing it? Oh god, that's, uh, that's totally something I would do.

[talking faster]

Okay, let me just— let me check my bag again. Sometimes it falls off and just, like, sits at the bottom with all the, um, the random receipts and— [rustling sounds] no, nope, not seeing it. Great.

[resigned but thinking]

I mean, I could probably just, uh, just tell security that I forgot it? They know me, right? I've been here for like two years, so— but what if it's that new guy? He's not gonna— he's not gonna know who I am.

[brightening slightly]

Actually, wait, I think Sarah gets in early. I could just, um, I could just text her to come let me in? That's not too weird, right? People forget their badges all the time. [exhale] Okay, yeah, that's— that's the plan.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 2db52e1e | Role: Character 1 (A)

386 Character 1: [shocked] OH MY GOD, is that—is that YOUR profile?! [nervous laughter] I just swiped right as a joke because the bio was hilarious, but [voice rising] I didn't realize it was actually you behind those sunglasses!

Character 2: [mortified] Wait, wait, wait, YOU'RE "AdventureSeeker92"? [squeaking] I literally wrote "looking for someone who doesn't steal my fries" because of you! [faster] This is so weird, we need to unmatch immediately before anyone sees this.

387 Character 1: [hysterical giggling] The algorithm really said "best friends to lovers pipeline" and I'm SCREAMING. [whispered] But honestly, your profile pics are kinda hot? [normal volume] When did you get abs, and why didn't I know about this development?

Character 2: [defensive] Those are from good lighting and angles, okay? [embarrassed mumble] Plus you used that photo from Jessica's wedding where you looked like a literal model. [accusingly] That's basically catfishing since you normally wear sweatpants everywhere.

388 Character 1: [dramatically] We've been having breakfast together every Sunday for three years. [slower pace] We've seen each other cry over exes, throw up after tequila, and [pause] [quietly] now we're a ninety-eight percent compatibility match?

Character 2: [panicking] Should we tell people? [rapid words] Like, do we pretend this never happened or make it our party story? [long exhale] God, imagine explaining this at your mom's birthday dinner next week.

389 Character 1: [thoughtfully] You know what's really messing with me here? [gentle tone] The app says we have "exceptional chemistry" based on our answers. [snorting laugh] We couldn't even agree on pizza toppings last night without a twenty-minute debate!

Character 2: [sarcastically] Oh sure, because a questionnaire knows us better than we know ourselves. [getting louder] Although... you did list "The Office" as your comfort show. [softly] I never knew we both cry at Jim's proposal.

390 Character 1: [hesitant] This is probably terrible timing but... [trailing off] remember when everyone always asked if we were dating? [quickly] What if we went on one fake date just to see how spectacularly awkward it would be?

Character 2: [incredulous] Are you seriously suggesting we GO on the date? [quieter] Like, actually meet at a restaurant, pretend we don't know each other's deepest secrets? [nervous chuckle] Would you shake my hand and introduce yourself?

391 Character 1: [excited whisper] Think about it though—we already know each other's worst habits! [building enthusiasm] No surprises, no disappointments, no finding out they're secretly married! [laughing] Plus, I already know you're allergic to shellfish and hate small talk.

Character 2: [skeptically] You literally once described my dating style as "chaotic raccoon energy." [more serious] How would this even work? [stammering] Do I... do I pretend I don't know about your weird fear of butterflies?

392 Character 1: [mock formal] "Hello, I'm a Sagittarius who enjoys long walks and adventure." [breaking character] [cackling] I can't do this with a straight face when I've literally held your hair back in so many bar bathrooms!

Character 2: [resigned sigh] You know what's the absolute worst part of this whole situation? [lower voice] My mom's going to find out somehow and never let us live it down. [groaning] She's been shipping us since freshman year.

393 Character 1: [philosophically] Maybe this is the universe telling us something profound and meaningful. [pause] [more casually] Or maybe it's just proof that dating apps are broken when they match people who've already seen each other's retainer face.

Character 2: [firmly] Okay, here's what we're going to do. [measured pace] We screenshot everything for evidence, unmatch, and then drink wine until we forget this happened. [pleading] Please tell me you have that good rosé left.

394 Character 1: [mischievously] But what if we're passing up our rom-com moment here? [theatrical] Best friends realize they were meant to be! [deflating] Although knowing us, it'd be more like a comedy special about failed relationships.

Character 2: [laughing nervously] Stop making it weird! [affectionately] You're my person, but like, in a "I'll help you hide a body" way, not [pause] [awkwardly] in a "let's make out" way. That would change everything!

395 Character 1: [suddenly serious] Wait, I just read your "ideal first date" answer. [disbelief] Mini golf and ice cream? [touched] That's literally what we did last Tuesday, except we called it "mental health maintenance."

Character 2: [quiet realization] Oh my god, we've been dating without dating. [faster and panicked] Abort mission, DELETE THE APP, this is too much self-awareness for a Thursday! [shouting] We're getting drunk and never speaking of this again!

Script: 5edbf620 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] I've been sitting here for three hours—THREE hours—with my son who's burning up with fever! [louder] His temperature is 103.2 degrees, and we checked in at [groans] at 2:47 PM with confirmation number E-7749.

396 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir, and I see you here in our system. Unfortunately, we're seeing 47 patients today with, um, more critical conditions. Your son's vitals are stable, so he's priority level 3.

Character 1: [angrily] Priority 3? My insurance ID is BX447892-A, I pay $1,200 a month for coverage! [getting louder] That woman who came in after us—she just went back! How is a sprained ankle more urgent than a child's fever?

397 Customer Support: Sir, we don't discuss other patients' conditions, but I assure you our triage nurses follow strict protocols. The average wait today is approximately 4 hours and 15 minutes. Would you like me to have someone recheck your son's temperature?

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, another temperature check, that'll really help! [exasperated] Look, I—I called ahead, spoke to someone named Jennifer at extension 3421. [desperately] She said it wouldn't be this long, maybe 90 minutes tops!

398 Customer Support: I see the note from Jennifer here, but that was before our two-car accident arrived at 3:22 PM. We've had to redirect six doctors to trauma. I can move you to urgent care at 1847 West Medical Drive, but their wait is currently 2 hours.

Character 1: [incredulous] Drive another twenty minutes to wait another two hours? [groans loudly] My son can barely keep his eyes open! [pleading] Can't you just—just bump us up a little bit, even to priority 2B or something?

399 Customer Support: Priority levels aren't negotiable, sir, they're based on medical assessment criteria in our protocol manual, section 14.3.B. However, let me page Dr. Martinez directly. She sometimes does quick evaluations between patients, though I can't promise anything.

Character 1: [desperately] Yes, please, page her—anyone! [faster] My wife's already called four times from her shift at Memorial Hospital, employee ID MH-9982. [breaking] She's a nurse there and she's—she's really worried about the fever not breaking!

400 Customer Support: I'm paging Dr. Martinez now to room 12, and I see your wife's affiliation in our partner network. [warmly] Let me also get you access code W447 for our family comfort room. It has a bed where your son can lie down while waiting.

Script: 1aa05051 | Role: Customer Support

401 Customer Support: [professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling Meridian Investments. This is Sandra speaking, how may I assist you today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, hi, I've been trying to transfer my portfolio for three weeks now. [sighs heavily] Every time I call, someone tells me something different about—about the requirements.

402 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account right away—can you provide me with your account number and the last four digits of your social?

Character 1: [impatiently] It's 4-4-7-2-9-1, and the last four are 8-8-3-5. [more firmly] Look, I just need someone to actually process this transfer, not give me another runaround.

403 Customer Support: Absolutely, Mr. Henderson, I see your account here. Now, I'm showing an ACATS transfer request initiated on October 15th that appears to be pending—um—pending verification of your medallion signature guarantee.

Character 1: [exasperated] The medallion signature? [groans] I already sent that in twice! Once by mail, once through your secure portal thing.

404 Customer Support: Oh, I do see one submission from October 20th. [more quickly] However, it seems the bank officer's stamp was partially illegible, so our compliance team couldn't—they couldn't verify the authenticity.

Character 1: [incredulous] Are you kidding me right now? [slower, deliberate] The bank manager himself stamped it while I watched. How is that not authentic enough for you people?

405 Customer Support: I know this is incredibly frustrating, Mr. Henderson. Here's what I can do—I'll escalate this directly to our transfer specialist team and have them review the documentation you've already provided within the next two hours.

Character 1: [skeptically] Two hours? [sarcastically] That's what they said last Tuesday, and here we are, still nothing.

406 Customer Support: Sir, I'm personally flagging this as priority status right now. [quickly] Additionally, I'm providing you with a direct callback number—877-555-4421—that bypasses our regular queue entirely.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Okay, fine, but what about the fees? [concerned] My new broker says you're charging me $125 for a transfer that should be free.

407 Customer Support: Let me check that for you immediately. [pause] Oh, I see the issue—the fee was applied in error because the system categorized this as an expedited transfer.

Character 1: [annoyed] Expedited? [chuckles bitterly] Three weeks of delays is your idea of expedited service?

408 Customer Support: You're absolutely right, that's unacceptable. I'm reversing that charge right now, and I'm also applying a courtesy credit of $50 for the inconvenience you've experienced.

Character 1: [somewhat appeased] Well, that's... that's something at least. [cautiously] So when can I realistically expect this transfer to complete?

409 Customer Support: With the priority escalation I'm implementing now, you should see movement within 24 to 48 hours. I'm also sending you a confirmation email with a reference number—TRF-789456—so you can track this directly.

Character 1: [sighs] Alright, Sandra, I appreciate you actually listening. [firmly] But if this doesn't happen by Friday, I'm filing a complaint with FINRA.

410 Customer Support: That's completely within your rights, Mr. Henderson. However, I'm confident we'll have this resolved well before then—I'm personally monitoring this case.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll give it until Friday. [quietly] Thanks for your help, I guess we'll see what happens.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

411 [Happy] Oh my god, I actually—wait, I won something? [Laugh] This literally never happens to me, like, ever!

412 [Disappointed] It's, uh, it's just a keychain. [Sigh] I mean, I guess it's better than nothing, right?

413 [Fast] [Excited] No way no way no way, did they just call my number? That's mine—that's actually my ticket!

414 [Sarcastic] Wow, a whole five dollars, I can finally retire early. [Tsk] Better call my boss right now.

415 [Whisper] Should I, like, should I go up there now or—I dunno, everyone's kinda staring at me.

416 [Slow] [Happy] You know what? This is... this is actually really sweet. [Chuckle] Made my whole week, honestly.

417 [Angry] Are you—are you kidding me? [Fast] I bought fifty tickets and all I get is this stupid pen?

418 [Sad] My mom would've been so, um, she would've loved seeing me win something, even something small like this. [Sigh]

419 [Shout] That's me! [Laugh] [Fast] Oh my god, I can't believe—sorry, sorry, I'm just really excited!

420 [Disappointed] [Slow] I thought third place would be, I dunno, something bigger than a—what even is this, a bookmark?

421 [Happy] Wait, can I, like, take a picture with it? [Chuckle] My kids are never gonna believe daddy actually won something!

422 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh fantastic, another coffee mug, just what I needed for my collection of, uh, literally dozens of coffee mugs.

423 [Whisper] [Sad] I kinda feel bad taking it when, you know, other people probably wanted it more than—never mind.

424 [Angry] This is rigged—I mean, come on! [Groan] The person next to me gets the TV and I get socks?

425 [Happy] [Slow] Honestly? I don't even care what it is, I just... I never win anything, y'know? [Laugh]

426 [Shout] [Fast] Yes yes yes yes yes! Wait—oh, it's just the small one? [Disappointed] Whatever, I'll take it!

427 [Sarcastic] Ten dollars at Applebee's, um, wow. [Tsk] [Slow] Guess I can almost afford half an appetizer now, right?

428 [Whisper] [Happy] Is this—is this really happening? Like, they're not gonna take it back or anything, are they?

429 [Disappointed] [Fast] I drove forty minutes for this raffle and—ugh, seriously? [Groan] A stress ball? That's it?

430 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Slow] I almost didn't even enter, and now here I am with this, uh, this random little prize.

431 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a misfiled document, then finding it right where it should be

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my God, I had the worst morning. I'm telling you, I almost lost it completely over this stupid document that went missing. Like, I spent forty minutes tearing apart my entire filing system looking for this contract.

[annoyed]

I'm talking drawers everywhere, papers all over my desk, I even checked the trash twice because I was like, did I accidentally throw this away? And of course my boss keeps asking about it every five minutes like "Did you find it yet? We need it for the meeting."

[increasingly agitated]

And I'm just— I'm sitting there thinking, okay, either I'm losing my mind or someone moved it, because I swear I put it exactly where it— I always put important stuff in the same place, you know? I'm not disorganized like that.

[sigh] [defeated]

So finally I call my coworker Sarah to see if maybe she borrowed it or something, and she's like "Did you check the active files?" And I'm like, yeah obviously I checked the— 

[pause] [realization dawning]

Wait. Wait, hold on. I'm literally— I'm looking right now and it's... [half laugh] Oh you have got to be kidding me.

[sheepish] [slightly embarrassed]

It's right here. Right where it should be, in the active files. I don't know how I missed it three times, but... [nervous laugh] Yeah, I may have completely lost it over nothing.
