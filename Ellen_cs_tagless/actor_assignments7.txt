Character 1: When's the last time you called just to talk?

519 Character 2: Oh god, okay—that's... um, that's fair. That's totally fair. I know I've been—wait, actually let me think... [nervous laugh] Wow, it's been a while hasn't it?

Character 1: Three months. And that was to borrow my car.

520 Character 2: No no no, that's not—okay yeah, I did need the car but I also wanted to see you! I mean, I always wanna see you, it's just that lately I've been so crazy with work and—that sounds like an excuse. Sorry.

Character 1: What do you need this time?

521 Character 2: I don't—nothing! I mean, okay, yes, I was gonna ask about your printer but that's not why I—ugh, this looks so bad. I literally just realized how this looks and I feel like such a jerk right now.

Character 1: At least you're aware.

522 Character 2: I'm sorry. I really am. Like, you're one of my best friends and I've been treating you like some kind of... I dunno, like a convenience store or something? That's—that's awful. [sigh] I didn't even realize I was doing it.

Character 1: How do you not realize that?

523 Character 2: I know, I know! It's just—everything's been so chaotic and when something comes up I think "oh, Sam will help" and I call, but I don't call when things are good because I'm just... I guess I assume you know we're good? But that's stupid. That's really stupid.

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

524 Character 2: You have every right to be mad. Honestly, I'd be furious if someone did this to me. Wait—has it really been every single time? Like every call?

Character 1: Want me to list them?

525 Character 2: No, I—actually yeah, maybe. Hit me with it. I deserve to hear it because clearly I've been completely oblivious and—god, I'm that friend aren't I? The one everyone complains about. [groan]

Character 1: Moving help, printer, car, Netflix password, recommendation letter, dog sitting. Should I continue?

526 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm the worst. Like actually the worst person. I can't believe—no wonder you're mad. I wouldn't even pick up the phone if I were you.

Character 1: I almost didn't.

527 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better. I mean it. Starting right now, no more asking for stuff. And I wanna actually hang out, like for real, just because. Would you maybe wanna get coffee this week? My treat, obviously.

Character 1: You sure you don't need me to drive you there?

528 Character 2: Okay I deserved that. [nervous laugh] But no, I'll pick YOU up. And we're going wherever you wanna go, and I'm not asking for a single thing except maybe your forgiveness? Eventually? When you're ready, I mean. No pressure.

Script: d97022de_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. I got invited to speak at a conference.

529 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? You got—okay, that's huge! Like, that's actually huge! Which conference? Tell me everything right now.

Character 1: TechConnect. In March.

530 Character 2: TechConnect? Are you—that's like, the conference, right? The one with all the, um, all the big names? [Gasp] Oh my god, how are you so calm about this?

Character 1: I'm not calm. I'm terrified.

531 Character 2: Okay okay, yeah, no that's—that's totally normal. I'd be freaking out too. But like, they picked you for a reason, y'know? What're you gonna talk about?

Character 1: Machine learning stuff. The project from last year.

532 Character 2: The one you basically lived at the office for? That—honestly that makes so much sense. People need to hear about that. It was kinda groundbreaking, wasn't it?

Character 1: It wasn't groundbreaking.

533 Character 2: Um, excuse me? You literally— [Laugh] okay no, you can't downplay this. Three patents? That's not nothing, babe.

Character 1: Patents don't mean I can speak in front of five hundred people.

534 Character 2: Five hun—okay wow. That's... yeah, that's a lot of people. But like, here's the thing though—you explain complex stuff to me all the time and I actually get it, so...

Character 1: That's different. You're one person.

535 Character 2: I mean, kinda? But also like—wait, have you done any public speaking before? Even like, smaller stuff?

Character 1: Team presentations. That's it.

536 Character 2: Okay okay, so we're gonna—actually, you know what? My cousin does speaking coach stuff. Super chill, not weird about it. Want me to, um, want me to connect you? [Sigh] Sorry, I'm being pushy.

Character 1: No, that might help. Maybe.

537 Character 2: Really? Oh good, 'cause honestly I was gonna suggest it anyway. You're gonna be—you're gonna be amazing though. Like, once you get up there and start talking about your work? You light up.

Character 1: I don't light up.

538 Character 2: You totally do! It's like—okay you don't see it, but when you explain that algorithm stuff? You get this whole... thing. It's actually really cute. Anyway, when do you have to confirm?

Script: 704ebafe_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You knew about the divorce.

539 Character 2: I—yeah, I did. I mean, everyone kinda knew? But that's not—wait, that came out wrong. I should've called, I know I should've called.

Character 1: Three weeks.

540 Character 2: Three weeks, I know, I know. God, I'm such a terrible friend. I kept meaning to reach out but then I'd be like "what if they need space" and then—[nervous laugh] that sounds so stupid now, doesn't it?

Character 1: Space. Right.

541 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I wasn't avoiding you, I swear. I literally typed out like fifteen different texts but none of them felt right? Like, what do you even say when someone's whole life is falling apart, y'know?

Character 1: "Hey, how are you?" would've worked.

542 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right. I just—I overthought it so much that I ended up doing nothing which is like, literally the worst thing I could've done. [Sigh] I'm so sorry.

Character 1: Everyone else managed to figure it out.

543 Character 2: I know, and honestly? I have no excuse. I just—I got in my own head about it and then the longer I waited the weirder it felt to suddenly reach out and—god, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Making excuses.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

544 Character 2: Okay, let me just—let me be real with you for a second. I was scared. My parents' divorce was so ugly and I didn't—I didn't wanna say the wrong thing and make it worse for you.

Character 1: So you said nothing instead.

545 Character 2: Which was worse, I get that now. I really—[groan] I really fucked up. You needed me and I wasn't there. That's on me, completely on me.

Character 1: I just needed my friend.

546 Character 2: I know. And I—shit, I'm gonna cry now. I should've been there. Should've just shown up with ice cream or something, y'know? Like a normal friend would.

Character 1: Ice cream would've been nice.

547 Character 2: Is it—is it too late? I mean, I could grab some right now if you want? Ben & Jerry's is still open and I know you like that brownie one, unless—unless you need me to just go?

Character 1: You remember my flavor?

548 Character 2: Of course I do. Half Baked, always Half Baked. Look, I know I messed up but I—I really wanna fix this. If you'll let me? Please?

Script: 8ff23d9c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. I defended yesterday.

549 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you WHAT? You defended? Like, the actual final defense defense? And you're just—you're just casually mentioning this now?

Character 1: Passed. I'm done.

550 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my— [Gasp] holy shit, you're a doctor! You're literally Dr.—I mean, that's insane! How do you feel? Are you like, totally exhausted or—?

Character 1: Mostly numb. Maybe relieved. Hard to tell.

551 Character 2: Yeah no, that's—honestly that makes total sense. Like, you've been working toward this for what, six years? Seven? It's gotta be so weird to just suddenly... be done, y'know?

Character 1: Seven and a half. But who's counting.

552 Character 2: Seven and a— [Laugh] okay, you were definitely counting. But like, I don't blame you at all. God, I remember when you started and you were all nervous about whether you'd even make it through the first year.

Character 1: That was a different person.

553 Character 2: Right? Right? Like, you've basically—I mean, you've completely transformed. The stuff you talk about now, it's like... I don't understand half of it but it sounds incredibly smart.

Character 1: You never understood any of it.

554 Character 2: Okay okay, fair point. But I—I tried! Remember when you were explaining your thesis and I kept asking about the—wait, what was it? The enzyme thing? And you just looked at me like I was hopeless.

Character 1: You were hopeless. Still are.

555 Character 2: Rude! But probably—probably true. [Chuckle] So what happens now? Like, do you just... leave? Start applying for fancy professor jobs?

Character 1: Post-doc first. Already lined up.

556 Character 2: Of course you do, you overachiever. Where—actually, wait, is it gonna be here or are you gonna have to move? Please don't—please tell me you're not leaving.

Character 1: Here. Two year contract.

557 Character 2: Oh thank god, I was about to—honestly I was gonna cry. But um, can we just... can we take a second to appreciate what you just did? Because this is huge. Like, monumentally huge.

Character 1: It's just a degree.

558 Character 2: No no no, don't—don't you dare minimize this. You literally just achieved something that like, what, two percent of people do? You're a doctor! We're gonna celebrate whether you like it or not, okay?

Script: 4625273a_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I saw you with Marcus earlier. All smiles.

559 Character 2: Okay, so? I mean—what's wrong with being friendly? He's in our psych class, we were just talking about the midterm.

Character 1: You hate Marcus.

560 Character 2: I don't—look, hate is a strong word. I'm not his biggest fan, sure, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be rude to him. That's just basic human decency, y'know?

Character 1: It's fake.

561 Character 2: It's not—[scoff] okay, fine, maybe I'm not being my most authentic self or whatever, but like, what do you want me to do? Tell him to his face that he's annoying? That's not who I am.

Character 1: No. You just tell me behind his back instead.

562 Character 2: That's—wow, that's really unfair. Everyone vents about people sometimes. You literally complained about your lab partner for twenty minutes yesterday, but I bet you still said "great job" when she finished her part.

Character 1: That's different.

563 Character 2: How? How is that different? Because—because I'm actually trying not to hurt people's feelings? [frustrated laugh] Like, I'm sorry I don't go around being brutally honest to everyone I meet.

Character 1: You're two different people. It's exhausting.

564 Character 2: I'm not—ugh, I'm not two different people. I'm just... polite. There's a difference between being fake and having basic social skills. Not everyone needs to know every single thought in my head.

Character 1: So which version do I get?

565 Character 2: Are you serious right now? You—you get the real me, obviously. That's why I can actually tell you how I feel about people. That's what friends do. Or at least, I thought that's what we did.

Character 1: Hard to tell anymore.

566 Character 2: Okay okay, that's—[sigh] that actually hurts. Like, if you really think I'm fake with you after everything, then I dunno what to tell you. Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.

Character 1: Maybe I don't.

567 Character 2: Fine. You know what? Fine. I'm—I'm trying to navigate the world without being an asshole to people, and somehow that makes me the bad guy here. Sorry I'm not mean enough for you, I guess.

Character 1: That's not what I'm saying.

568 Character 2: Then what? What are you saying? Because honestly, it sounds like you want me to just—to be cruel to people I don't like, and that's not... that's not gonna happen. I'd rather be "fake nice" than needlessly mean.

569 SCENARIO: realizing they wore the wrong shoes for the weather

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh, um, oh no. No no no. I can feel it already, like, my feet are just— they're already getting wet and I haven't even— I've been walking for, what, like two minutes? [sigh] These are definitely the wrong shoes for this.

[slightly annoyed]

I mean, I looked outside, I saw that it was, um, that it was cloudy, but I didn't think it was gonna be this— this soggy. Like, the ground is just completely soaked from last night and I'm wearing my, uh, my canvas sneakers. My canvas sneakers. [tsk] Brilliant choice there.

[resigned]

Okay, so my options are, um, what— go back home and change? But then I'm gonna be late for— no, I'm already cutting it close. Or I could just, I don't know, walk really carefully and avoid the, uh, avoid the puddles? 

[slightly defeated]

Right, because that's totally realistic. I'm gonna be tiptoeing around like some kind of— [laugh] okay, that's ridiculous. I guess I'm just gonna have wet feet today.

[matter-of-fact]

You know what? It's fine. They'll dry. I mean, they're just shoes, and it's just water, and I have, um, I have other shoes at home. Crisis averted. Sort of.

Script: bf5344db | Role: Character 1 (A)

570 Character 1: [trembling] Is that—is that really happening? [louder] The lock just clicked! [Sobbing laugh] After three years in this hellhole, the door is actually opening. I can't feel my legs. Someone pinch me right now!

Character 2: [whispered disbelief] Don't move too fast. [sharper] This could be a trick. [Nervous giggle] But look—sunlight! Real sunlight streaming through! My eyes are burning but I don't care. We're getting out, we're actually getting out!

571 Character 1: [hysterical laughter] Remember when we counted every single brick? [quieter] Two thousand forty-seven. [building excitement] Now we'll never see them again! I'm going to eat real food, sleep in a real bed, see my daughter!

Character 2: [shaking voice] My wife thinks I'm dead. [Bitter chuckle] Five years they told her. [increasingly frantic] What if she remarried? What if she moved away? God, what if no one's waiting for me out there?

572 Character 1: [firmly] Stop that thinking. [gentler] We survived this together, remember? [Choking up] You kept me sane when the darkness came. Your family never stopped loving you. They're waiting, I promise you they're still waiting.

Character 2: [high-pitched] The guard's waving us forward! [Gasping breath] My heart might explode. [more controlled] Take my hand—if I collapse, drag me out. I'm not dying in here, not when freedom is ten feet away.

573 Character 1: [booming joy] Fresh air! [softer wonder] Can you smell that? [Delighted squeal] It's grass and rain and life! I forgot the world had colors like this. Blue sky, green trees, everything's so impossibly bright!

Character 2: [overwhelmed] The space is too big. [Panicked breath] There's no walls! [steadying] No, this is good, this is what we wanted. I just need a minute. Twenty years makes you forget how huge everything is.

574 Character 1: [urgently] There's a car waiting. [suspicious] Why are they helping us? [Nervous laugh] Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe we just get in and figure out the rest later. What else can they take from us now?

Character 2: [in awe] Look at that driver's face. [cracking voice] He sees us as human. [Soft sob] Not prisoner 4829 or 7361. We have names again. We exist. We're real people who deserve to go home.

575 Character 1: [dreamily] Tonight I'll see stars. [more intensely] Real stars, not imagined ones. [Giddy giggle] I used to draw constellations on the ceiling with my fingernail. Now I'll lie on actual grass and count them properly.

Character 2: [quietly terrified] What if I can't adjust? [stronger] What if freedom is too much? [Hollow laugh] Sometimes a cage becomes comfortable. But no—I'd rather die out here than live another day in that cell.

576 Character 1: [reverently] The door's closing behind us. [celebratory shout] It's closing! [breathless] We're on the outside of it now. All those nights we dreamed this exact moment, and it's even better than we imagined it would be.

Character 2: [philosophical tone] You know what's strange? [lighter] I thought I'd feel angry. [Soft chuckle] But I just feel empty and full at the same time. Like I'm floating. Is this what resurrection feels like?

577 Character 1: [rushed words] Quick, memorize everything! [slowing down] The guard's face, the doorway, this exact second. [Fierce whisper] We earned this moment with blood and patience. No one can ever take this memory from us.

Character 2: [wobbly voice] My knees just gave out. [Laughing cry] But I'm smiling! [stronger] Can't stand but I'm smiling like an idiot! The ground out here feels different. Softer. Like it might actually let us rest.

578 Character 1: [determined] We walk out together. [emotional] Same as we survived—together. [Sharp exhale] Leave all the darkness in there. From this second forward, we're different men. We're survivors. We're free. We're magnificently, impossibly free!

Character 2: [monotone shock] It's really over. [building energy] The counting, the routines, the fear—over! [Explosive joy] OVER! I want to run until my lungs burst! I want to scream until the mountains hear me!

579 Character 1: [nostalgic already] Will you miss anything? [quickly] No, stupid question. [Thoughtful pause] Maybe just knowing you were there, through the wall. But now we can be friends in the light. That's infinitely better, right?

Character 2: [profound gratitude] Thank you for keeping me human. [wavering] When I wanted to become stone. [Crying laugh] Look at us—two broken birds learning we still have wings. Let's fly, brother. Let's finally, finally fly home.

Script: b93d05ae | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [yawning] Hello? Is this, um... [groggily] the Valley Sleep Center calling about my—my study from last Tuesday? [confused] It's barely 7:30 in the morning.

580 Customer Support: Good morning Mr. Henderson, yes, this is Dr. Martinez from Valley Sleep Center. I know it's early, but you requested the first available slot for your results discussion. [reassuring] Should I call back later?

Character 1: [sighs heavily] No, no, it's fine, I'm—I'm awake now. [more alertly] My patient ID is, uh, VSC-4829-B, right? Just need some coffee first.

581 Customer Support: That's correct, VSC-4829-B. So, during your overnight study at our facility on 2847 Riverside Drive, we recorded some interesting patterns. You experienced 47 apnea episodes per hour.

Character 1: [shocked] Forty-seven?! [groans] That sounds... that sounds really bad, doesn't it? [worried] My wife said I stop breathing sometimes, but forty-seven times?

582 Customer Support: It's definitely in the severe range, yes. But here's the good news—your oxygen levels only dropped below 88% about twelve times. That's actually better than most severe cases we see.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, only twelve times my brain wasn't getting enough oxygen. [sighs] What's the, um, what's the treatment plan here? [anxiously] Do I need one of those mask things?

583 Customer Support: A CPAP device would be the recommended treatment, yes. [reassuring] Your insurance pre-authorization code RX-9982-CPAP has already been approved. Most patients see improvement within just 3-4 nights of use.

Character 1: [reluctantly] I guess I don't have much choice, do I? [curiously] When can I pick it up? [yawns] And how much is this gonna cost me after insurance?

584 Customer Support: You can come to our equipment center at 1420 Medical Plaza, Suite 200-A, anytime after 2 PM today. Your copay will be $127.50. [brightly] We'll also schedule a follow-up in two weeks.

Character 1: [mumbling] One twenty-seven fifty, okay... [more clearly] Do I need to bring anything specific? [confused] The paperwork you sent had like fifteen different forms.

585 Customer Support: Just bring forms 3-A and 7-B, plus your insurance card. The others are optional questionnaires. [more seriously] Oh, and avoid eating a heavy meal before your fitting appointment.

Character 1: [frustrated] Forms 3-A and 7-B, got it. [sighs] My wife's gonna say "I told you so" about this whole thing. [resigned] She's been nagging me about my snoring for years.

586 Customer Support: Many partners notice the symptoms first, actually. She'll probably sleep better once you start treatment too. About 73% of our patients report their relationships improve significantly.

Character 1: [surprised] Seventy-three percent? [hopeful] That's actually pretty encouraging. [yawning] Sorry, I'm still not fully awake here. What time did you say for the pickup again?

587 Customer Support: Anytime after 2 PM at 1420 Medical Plaza, Suite 200-A. We're open until 6:30 PM. Just remember to call if you can't make it today—the confirmation number is APT-8847.

Character 1: [writing sounds implied in speech] APT-8847, okay I'm writing this down. [more alertly] And the follow-up is automatically scheduled, or do I need to call? [concerned] I travel a lot for work.

588 Customer Support: It's tentatively scheduled for November 15th at 3:30 PM. But we can definitely reschedule if needed. Just give us 48 hours notice using your patient portal access code MED-2290.

Character 1: [relieved] Perfect, November 15th works. [chuckles tiredly] Thanks for calling so early, I guess. [sarcastically] Nothing like severe sleep apnea news with your morning coffee, right?

589 Customer Support: At least now you know why you need that coffee so badly! You'll be amazed how much more energy you'll have once treatment starts. [professionally] Have a great day, Mr. Henderson, and we'll see you this afternoon.

Script: a253c668 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I've been waiting three weeks for someone to fix my sink. [getting louder] Three weeks! [sighs heavily] The water's been dripping nonstop, and my water bill is through the roof.

590 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your work order right now—uh, what was your apartment number again? We'll get this sorted out immediately.

Character 1: [exasperated] Apartment 4B, same as the last five times I called. [sarcastically] You guys said someone would come Monday, then Wednesday, [groans] and here we are on Friday with nothing.

591 Customer Support: Right, I see the issue here—our plumber had emergencies at other properties. But listen, I can guarantee someone tomorrow morning, first appointment at 8 AM sharp.

Character 1: [skeptically] Tomorrow morning? [laughs bitterly] That's what Maria told me last week. [slower] Do you people even write these appointments down, or... or are you just making promises?

592 Customer Support: Sir, we absolutely track everything in our system. [speaking rapidly] Sometimes emergencies happen—burst pipes, flooding—those take priority. But your sink repair is marked urgent now.

Character 1: [incredulous] Urgent? Now it's urgent? [voice rising] My kitchen's been a disaster zone, and I've got buckets everywhere! [desperately] I can't even have people over anymore.

593 Customer Support: I'm authorizing overtime pay for our weekend crew. Someone will be there tomorrow, no excuses. [reassuringly] Plus, I'm adding a rent credit for your troubles—how's fifty dollars sound?

Character 1: [tired] Fifty dollars doesn't even cover my increased water bill. [sighs deeply] But fine, tomorrow morning. [more firmly] If no one shows up, I'm calling the housing authority, understood?

594 Customer Support: Completely understood, and that won't be necessary. I'm personally putting this in our priority log, texting the plumber now. Eight AM tomorrow, apartment 4B, sink repair.

Character 1: [cautiously] And what's this plumber's name? [more directly] Because last time, the guy showed up, looked at it for two minutes, and said he needed different parts. [frustrated sigh] Then disappeared forever.

595 Customer Support: That would be Marcus, our senior technician. He'll have all necessary parts in his truck—washers, pipes, the works. No repeat of last time, I promise.

Character 1: [doubtfully] Marcus, huh? [muttering] Better not be the same Marcus who "fixed" my neighbor's toilet three times. [louder] It still doesn't flush properly, by the way.

596 Customer Support: [hastily] Different Marcus, different crew entirely. This one's been with us fifteen years, five-star reviews across the board. Your neighbor's issue is... being addressed separately.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll be waiting at eight. [more forcefully] But I'm not taking another day off work for nothing. [exhausted] This better actually happen this time.

597 Customer Support: [earnestly] It will happen, you have my word. I'm emailing you confirmation right now with Marcus's direct number. Is 4B still the best contact number for you?

Character 1: [curtly] Yes, same number, same apartment, same leak. [sighs] Just... please make sure he knows it's the kitchen sink, [slowly] not the bathroom one.

598 Customer Support: Kitchen sink, got it, highlighting that now in big bold letters. Marcus will also call you thirty minutes before arrival. We're going to fix this properly.

Character 1: [skeptically] Thirty-minute warning would be nice, yeah. [mutters] Though at this point, I'll believe it when I see him at my door. [tiredly] Anything else you need from me?

599 Customer Support: Nothing else needed, everything's set on our end. [speaking quickly] Tomorrow, 8 AM, Marcus will fix your kitchen sink. Thank you for your patience, and sorry for all the delays.

600 [Sad] Oh sweetie, I know, I know it hurts—but um, you know what? [Soft] We're gonna put a special bandaid on it, okay?

601 [Fast] Hey, hey, hey, look at me—watch this! [Happy] I can make my face do the silliest thing ever! [Laugh]

602 [Whisper] You wanna know a secret? [Slow] Sometimes... even grown-ups cry when they're scared too.

603 [Disappointed] I get it, buddy, I really—ugh, losing your favorite toy is just the worst. [Sigh]

604 [Happy] Oh my gosh, are those—are those dragon tears? [Chuckle] Those are super powerful, you know!

605 [Angry] That was NOT okay what they did to you, and I'm gonna—well, we're gonna fix this together, alright? [Tsk]

606 [Slow] Let's just... breathe for a second, okay? [Sigh] In through your nose, and out through your—that's it.

607 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, crying forever sounds like a great plan. [Chuckle] But maybe we could try ice cream first?

608 [Fast] Quick, quick—tell me five things you can see right now! [Happy] It's a game, come on!

609 [Sad] Your goldfish was, um—he was really special, wasn't he? [Slow] And it's okay to miss him lots.

613 [Slow] The scary dream's all gone now, see? [Whisper] It can't get you when I'm here.

614 [Sarcastic] Well obviously the world is ending because we're out of chocolate milk. [Tsk] [Fast] But guess what I found in the back of the fridge?

615 [Angry] Those mean kids don't know what they're—ugh, you're literally the coolest kid I know! [Groan] They're just jealous!

616 [Happy] Remember when you were brave at the doctor's yesterday? [Slow] You're being just as brave right now, I can tell.

617 [Fast] Okay so, um, what if we just—actually, you know what? [Shout] Let's have a crying contest! Whoever cries loudest wins!

618 [Disappointed] I wish I could make it all better right—like, instantly, but... [Sigh] [Soft] Sometimes feeling sad is part of getting better.

619 [Whisper] You feel all those big feelings in your tummy? [Happy] That just means your heart is extra special and full of love. [Chuckle]

620 SCENARIO: Mad about a long hold time, then the agent resolving everything in minutes

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my God, I literally just spent forty-seven minutes on hold with customer service. Forty-seven! I timed it because I was so— I was so angry I started like documenting everything.

[annoyed]

And you know how they have that stupid recording that's like "your call is important to us" every thirty seconds? [scoff] Right, so important that you left me sitting there for almost an hour listening to the worst hold music ever. It was like, elevator music but somehow worse.

[building anger]

I'm thinking okay, this is gonna take forever, they're gonna transfer me like three times, I'm gonna have to explain my whole situation over and over, and then they're gonna tell me there's nothing they can— 

[surprised]

Wait, someone's calling me. Hold on, that's... that's the same customer service number. 

[confused] [cautious]

Hello? Oh, hi, yes that's me— wait, you're calling me back? I didn't even— oh, you saw I was on hold for that long and you wanted to follow up personally?

[amazed]

That's... wow, okay. Yeah, let me grab my account info— oh, you already have it pulled up? And you can fix the billing thing and the— yeah, that works perfectly.

[sheepish] [grateful]

Okay so, [nervous laugh] I may have totally misjudged this whole situation. That woman just fixed literally everything in like three minutes and gave me a credit for the inconvenience. I feel kind of awful for being so angry now.
