Character 1: Got my first client today.

432 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? Your first freelance client? Oh my god, that's—that's huge! Like, this is actually happening now, you're really doing the thing!

Character 1: Yeah. It's just a small project.

433 Character 2: Okay no no no, don't do that. Don't like, minimize it, y'know? This is literally—[Laugh] sorry, I'm getting way too excited but this is your first actual paying client!

Character 1: They found me on LinkedIn. Weird, right?

434 Character 2: LinkedIn actually worked? That's—honestly that never happens. What're they, um, what're they having you do? Is it like, is it a good project at least?

Character 1: Logo redesign. Three concepts. Due in two weeks.

435 Character 2: Two weeks is—that's totally doable. And three concepts means they're gonna actually, like, respect your process and stuff. Did you already talk money? Sorry if that's—I mean, you don't have to tell me.

Character 1: More than I expected, actually.

436 Character 2: See? See, I told you—wait, did I tell you? I definitely thought about telling you that you were undervaluing yourself. [Chuckle] This is so good though, like, really.

Character 1: What if I mess it up?

437 Character 2: Oh, babe, no—you're not gonna mess it up. You're literally, you're so talented it's actually annoying sometimes? Plus like, they came to you, right? They already want what you do.

Character 1: I haven't done client work in forever.

438 Character 2: Okay but—but that's different from not knowing how, y'know? You've got the skills, you just gotta, um, dust them off a little. [Sigh] Are you freaking out? You're freaking out.

Character 1: Maybe a little.

439 Character 2: That's—honestly that's so normal though. Like, I'd be worried if you weren't kinda nervous? It means you care about doing good work, which is exactly why they're gonna love you.

Character 1: I already started sketching some ideas.

440 Character 2: Of course you did! See, you're already—you're in it, you're doing the thing! Can I, can I see them? Or is it too early? I promise I won't be weird about it.

Character 1: They're rough. But yeah, okay.

441 Character 2: Yes yes yes! Oh man, this is—I'm so proud of you, seriously. Like, you took the leap and the universe just... caught you, y'know?

Script: ceef2008_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told Marcus I'm bi.

442 Character 2: Oh god, I—okay, I know how this looks but it wasn't—I didn't mean to tell him, it just kinda... slipped out? We were talking about Pride and he mentioned something about allies and I just—fuck, I'm so sorry.

Character 1: It slipped out.

443 Character 2: No no no, that came out wrong. I mean—it's not like I was gossiping or anything, we were having this whole conversation about representation and I got caught up and [nervous laugh] honestly I forgot it wasn't my thing to share, which is so stupid, I know.

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

444 Character 2: I've been feeling sick about it all day. Like literally—I tried to text you but I couldn't figure out what to say because there's no good excuse, y'know? I just... I fucked up. I really, really fucked up.

Character 1: I wasn't ready for him to know.

445 Character 2: I know. God, I know and that's the worst part. You trusted me with something huge and I just—I blew it. [sigh] I'm usually so good at keeping secrets, I swear, but I got comfortable and stupid and I wasn't thinking about how this was yours to tell, not mine.

Character 1: He's been weird all day. Won't look at me.

446 Character 2: Wait, what? No no no, that's not—okay when I talked to him after, he seemed totally cool with it. Like he was actually really supportive? Maybe he's just... processing? Or maybe he doesn't know how to bring it up? I dunno, I'm trying to—sorry, I'm not helping.

Character 1: You talked to him after?

447 Character 2: Um, yeah? I mean—I realized what I'd done like immediately and I kinda panicked so I told him not to say anything to you because it wasn't my place to share and to just—to pretend he didn't know? But obviously that's not... that didn't work.

Character 1: So now he's pretending he doesn't know something he definitely knows. Great.

448 Character 2: Fuck. Yeah, that's—that's actually worse, isn't it? I was trying to fix it but I just made everything more awkward. Classic me, right? Always making things worse when I'm trying to help.

Character 1: This isn't about you.

449 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right, I'm sorry. I'm making this about me when you're the one who—when I violated your trust and took away your choice about when and how to come out to him. That's... that's really shitty of me. The whole thing, I mean.

Character 1: Yeah. It was.

450 Character 2: Is there anything I can do? Like, genuinely asking here because I wanna make this right but I don't—I don't wanna make it worse again, y'know? Should I talk to Marcus? Should I not talk to Marcus? [groan] I just... tell me what you need from me.

Character 1: I need you to actually think before you speak. For once.

451 Character 2: That's... yeah, that's fair. More than fair, honestly. I promise—I know my promises probably don't mean much right now but I swear I'm gonna work on that. On keeping my mouth shut when it's not my story to tell. I'm really, really sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything but... I am.

Script: b761992c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I got the dog.

452 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you got the dog? The actual dog you've been talking about for like, literally years? Oh my god, I'm gonna cry. When did this happen?

Character 1: Yesterday. Her name's Mabel.

453 Character 2: Mabel! That's—okay that's literally the cutest name I've ever heard. Is she like, is she the rescue you were looking at? The one with the—um, the floppy ears?

Character 1: Different one. This one chose me.

454 Character 2: She chose you? [Gasp] Stop it, that's so—I mean, that's exactly how it's supposed to happen, right? Like the universe just... knows. Tell me everything about her.

Character 1: She's scared of the vacuum. And doorways. And her own tail sometimes.

455 Character 2: Oh no no no, baby girl! That's—honestly though? That's kinda heartbreaking but also really sweet that she trusts you already. How's she doing with like, settling in and stuff?

Character 1: She slept on my feet all night. Wouldn't move.

456 Character 2: Are you kidding me right now? That's—she already loves you so much. I'm literally gonna [Laugh] —sorry, I'm just so happy for you. You've wanted this for so long.

Character 1: It's weird having something depend on me.

457 Character 2: Yeah, I mean—I totally get that. It's like, suddenly you're responsible for this whole other life, y'know? But honestly? You're gonna be such a good dog parent. You're like, the most reliable person I know.

Character 1: She ate my shoe this morning. The left one.

458 Character 2: Just the left— [Chuckle] okay that's actually hilarious. Did she like, completely destroy it or just kinda nibble?

Character 1: It's confetti. Very thorough work.

459 Character 2: Oh my god, she's already got personality! That's—wait, were they expensive shoes? Please tell me they weren't the ones you just bought.

Character 1: The new running shoes. Yeah.

460 Character 2: Noooo! Okay okay, but like—you're not even mad, are you? I can tell. You're totally already in love with this disaster dog.

Character 1: Maybe. She does this thing where she sighs really dramatically.

461 Character 2: Stop—she sighs? Like a little person? That's it, I'm coming over immediately. I need to meet this perfect angel baby who destroys shoes and sighs about it.

Script: 43680e5f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told me who dies in the finale.

462 Character 2: Oh god, oh no—wait, I didn't mean to! I thought you'd already watched it! Everyone's been talking about it for like two weeks and I just assumed—

Character 1: I told you I was on episode three.

463 Character 2: I know, I know, but that was—that was like a month ago! And you're always binging stuff so fast, y'know? Like remember when you watched all of Succession in literally four days? [nervous laugh] I just figured...

Character 1: You figured wrong.

464 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I did. God, I'm so sorry. I literally just—I got so excited talking about it and the words just came out before I could stop myself. You know how I get when I'm really into something.

Character 1: I've been avoiding spoilers for six weeks.

465 Character 2: Oh no. Oh no no no, that makes it so much worse. I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. Like, I can't believe I did that to you. [groan] I honestly wanna crawl into a hole right now.

Character 1: It was the one thing I asked you not to talk about.

466 Character 2: I know! And I—okay, there's no excuse. None. But I swear I wasn't thinking, which I know sounds terrible but my brain just completely forgot and—ugh, that's not helping, is it?

Character 1: Not really.

467 Character 2: Right. Of course not. Um, can I—would it help if I watched it with you anyway? Like we could still experience it together? I mean, I know it's not the same, but maybe I could point out stuff you might've missed or—actually, that's probably making it worse.

Character 1: Why would I want to watch it now?

468 Character 2: Because there's—there's still so much you don't know! Like how it happens and all the stuff leading up to it. The journey's still worth it, right? [sigh] Okay, I'm grasping at straws here, I know.

Character 1: This was my comfort show. You know that.

469 Character 2: I do. I do know that, and that's what makes me feel even more terrible. Like, you've had such a rough month and this was your escape thing and I just—I ruined it. I completely ruined it for you.

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

470 Character 2: Is there—is there anything I can do? Like, literally anything? I'll watch whatever terrible reality show you want for the next month, or I could—I dunno, ban myself from talking about TV shows ever again?

Character 1: That would last maybe two days.

471 Character 2: [nervous laugh] Okay, fair. That's... that's actually fair. But seriously, I'm gonna be so much more careful from now on. Like, I'm gonna ask three times before I say anything about any show ever. I promise. I really am sorry.

472 SCENARIO: waiting for water to boil

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, water. Just need to get this water to— to boil. How hard can it be, right? Just, uh, just put the pot on the stove and wait. [sigh] But why does it always feel like it takes forever when you're actually, um, when you're actually watching it?

[slightly impatient]

I mean, they say a watched pot never boils, but that's— that's not actually true, right? It's just, uh, it's just that time moves differently when you're standing here staring at— at nothing. [tsk] Maybe I should do something else while I wait?

[contemplative]

But then what if I, um, what if I forget about it and it boils over? That happened last week with the— the pasta water, and it was such a mess. So maybe I should just— just stay here and, uh, and babysit this thing.

[drawn out, bored]

Are those bubbles? No, no that's just— that's just the bottom of the pot. False alarm. [hmm] God, this is like watching paint dry, except I actually need this water to, um, to cooperate with me here.

[brighter, trying to be optimistic]

Okay, okay, maybe I can use this time to, uh, to think about what I'm actually making. Planning ahead, being productive and— oh wait, are those actual bubbles now? Finally.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 555ddffd | Role: Character 1 (A)

473 Character 1: [shaking voice] Oh my God, oh my God, it's here—the email is here! [getting faster] I can't click it, my hands are literally trembling. [Sharp inhale] What if we failed? What if all those months of studying meant nothing?

Character 2: [breathlessly] Don't say that! [higher pitched] We studied together every single day, remember? [Nervous laugh] Okay, okay, let's count to three and open them at the exact same time. My heart is beating so fast I might actually pass out.

474 Character 1: [whispered panic] Wait, I need water first. [louder] No, forget water—I need oxygen! [Hyperventilating] One... two... I can't do this. You go first and tell me if yours is good news, then I'll know there's hope for mine.

Character 2: [frantically] Are you insane? [slower, trembling] If I passed and you didn't, I'd feel horrible. [Gasp] Let's just rip off the band-aid together. Put your finger on your screen. Ready? Here we go—clicking now!

475 Character 1: [screaming] I PASSED! [sobbing] Oh my God, I actually passed! [more quietly] Three years of law school, six months of bar prep, and it's finally over. Look at my name on that pass list—it's really there!

Character 2: [stunned whisper] Mine says... [explosive joy] PASS! WE'RE LAWYERS! [Shrieking laugh] We actually did it! Remember when we thought we'd never understand constitutional law? And now look at us—actual attorneys! This is insane!

476 Character 1: [through tears] My mom is going to lose her mind. [sniffling] She already bought a frame for the certificate. [Giggling uncontrollably] Should we call everyone now or wait until we stop shaking? I can barely hold my phone steady.

Character 2: [giddy] Let them wait! [more seriously] This moment is ours first. [Whooping] We survived the worst exam known to mankind! Remember day two when we both cried in the parking lot? Worth every tear now!

477 Character 1: [calming down] I literally thought I failed after the essays. [laughing] Contracts destroyed me. [Deep exhale] But somehow, some way, we made it through. We're going to be the best lawyers this city has ever seen.

Character 2: [emotionally] Six years of friendship, three years of study groups. [choking up] We dreamed about this day so many times. [Soft laugh] Now we need to plan the biggest celebration party in history. Champagne is definitely not enough!

478 Character 1: [determined] First, we're framing these results. [excitedly building] Then we're getting those business cards printed immediately! [Squealing] Can you believe we can actually put "Attorney at Law" after our names now? This feels like a dream.

Character 2: [in disbelief] I keep refreshing to make sure it's real. [more confidently] It still says pass! [Cackling] Remember Professor Williams who said we asked too many questions? Bet those questions helped us pass this beast!

479 Character 1: [nostalgic tone] All those flashcards, practice exams, outline sessions. [getting louder] Every sacrifice was worth this exact moment! [Contented sigh] My student loans suddenly feel less crushing knowing I can actually practice law now.

Character 2: [philosophically] You know what's crazy? [building excitement] Yesterday we were just law graduates, today we're actual lawyers! [Breathless laugh] The imposter syndrome is hitting hard, but who cares—we earned this title fair and square!

480 Character 1: [quietly intense] Promise me something right now. [more firmly] We'll never forget how this feels—this pure joy, this relief. [Shaky breath] When we're stressed at our firms, we'll remember we conquered the bar exam together.

Character 2: [solemnly] I promise. [brightening up] We should take a screenshot of these results immediately! [Giggling] Future us will need proof that this happiness existed. Also, should we update LinkedIn now or wait until tomorrow?

481 Character 1: [mischievously] Update it now! [dramatically] Let everyone see it at 3 PM on a Tuesday! [Snorting laugh] "Pleased to announce I passed the bar exam" sounds so professional when inside I'm literally screaming with joy.

Character 2: [mockingly formal] "I am humbled to share..." [breaking character, laughing] Who are we kidding? [Enthusiastically] I'm posting "I'M A LAWYER" in all caps with fifty exclamation points! Humble can wait until tomorrow!

482 Character 1: [winding down] My adrenaline is finally dropping. [peaceful] This morning feels like a year ago. [Soft chuckle] We woke up as nervous wrecks and now we're going to sleep as lawyers. What a plot twist.

Character 2: [warmly] Thank you for going through this with me. [getting emotional] Having a study partner who became family made everything bearable. [Happy sigh] Now let's go get those drinks we've been promising ourselves since day one of bar prep!

Script: b447d902 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [furious] I need to speak to your manager RIGHT NOW about room 347! [voice shaking] There are bed bugs everywhere—I've got bites all over my arms and, and my luggage is probably infested! [disgusted] This is absolutely unacceptable for a supposedly four-star establishment.

483 Customer Support: Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear about this situation, let me pull up your reservation immediately. [apologetically] Can you please confirm your last name and confirmation number? We take these matters very seriously and I'll get our manager involved right away.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Henderson, H-E-N-D-E-R-S-O-N, confirmation BK4729X. [louder] I've been a platinum member for six years—member ID 88291-PLT—and I've never experienced anything this horrific! [trembling with anger] My daughter's wedding is tomorrow and now I have welts all over my face!

484 Customer Support: Mr. Henderson, I completely understand your frustration, this is truly awful. I'm immediately moving you to our premium suite 812, and we'll have housekeeping collect your belongings for professional treatment. Would you like us to arrange medical attention for those bites?

Character 1: [incredulous] Medical attention? [shouting] I want a FULL refund, not just a room change! [bitterly] I've already spent $2,400 on this three-night stay, plus I'll need to replace everything in my suitcase—that's another thousand dollars at least!

485 Customer Support: [calmly] Sir, I'm authorizing a complete refund to your card ending in 4892. Additionally, we'll cover dry cleaning and replacement costs up to $1,500 with proper receipts. Our general manager, Ms. Rodriguez, will personally meet you in fifteen minutes to discuss further compensation.

Character 1: [skeptically] Fifteen minutes? [groans] I've already been dealing with this nightmare for two hours since 3 AM! [exhausted] And what about the other guests—are you even checking rooms 345, 346, and 349? This could be an entire floor infestation!

486 Customer Support: We've already initiated our emergency protocol and pest control arrives at 6 AM. [reassuringly] All adjacent rooms are being inspected and relocated as we speak—that's twelve rooms total. I know this doesn't undo your experience, but we're treating this as our highest priority incident.

Character 1: [mockingly] Highest priority? [gasps] Then why did the night clerk tell me to just "shake out the sheets" when I first complained? [angrily] I want this documented, I want corporate's number—1-800 whatever—and I want written confirmation of everything you're promising!

487 Customer Support: Absolutely, I'm documenting everything in incident report TX-20241122-BUG-347. Corporate's complaint line is 1-800-555-8200, case reference number will be HC8829M. [more warmly] I'm also personally ensuring you receive email confirmation within ten minutes to JHenderson at gmail dot com, correct?

Script: 499d7966 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] The heater's been broken for three weeks now, and I've sent—what—four emails already? [groans] My kids are sleeping in winter coats, [more angrily] and you keep saying "someone will come by soon."

488 Customer Support: I understand your frustration completely, and I'm so sorry about the delay. Our maintenance team has been overwhelmed with, uh, emergency repairs, but I'll escalate this to priority status right now.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Priority status? That's what you said last Tuesday! [sighs heavily] Look, I'm paying fifteen hundred a month for a place where—where I can see my breath indoors, [incredulous] how is this acceptable?

489 Customer Support: [briskly] You're absolutely right, this isn't acceptable at all. Let me check the system... okay, I see the work orders were never properly assigned. I'm personally scheduling someone for tomorrow morning, guaranteed.

Character 1: [skeptical] Tomorrow morning, really? [chuckles bitterly] Because last time you "guaranteed" something, I waited all day and nobody—nobody even called to cancel. [exhausted] I had to miss work for nothing.

490 Customer Support: I completely understand why you don't trust us right now. Here's what I'll do—I'm sending you the technician's direct number, and if they don't show by noon, I'll authorize a rent reduction.

Character 1: [surprised] A rent reduction? [cautiously optimistic] Well, that's... that's the first real solution I've heard. [sighs] But what about the mold in the bathroom that I mentioned two months ago?

491 Customer Support: [quickly] The mold issue, yes, I see those reports here too. Since we're already sending maintenance tomorrow, I'll—I'll make sure they assess both problems. [reassuringly] One visit, both issues addressed, no more runaround.

Character 1: [firmly] I need this in writing—all of it. [more insistently] The appointment time, the rent reduction terms, and... and a timeline for the mold remediation. [tired] I can't keep chasing you people anymore.

492 Customer Support: Absolutely, I'm drafting the email right now as we speak. You'll have it within ten minutes with all details, my supervisor's signature, and our sincere apologies for this unacceptable situation.

Character 1: [relieved] Finally, someone who actually listens. [sighs] You know, if this had happened weeks ago, we wouldn't be having this conversation. [curiously] Are you new here or something?

493 Customer Support: [chuckles softly] Actually, I'm the regional manager filling in today. These complaints reached my desk this morning, and honestly, I'm not happy with how my team handled this.

Character 1: [impressed] The regional manager? [laughs nervously] Well, that explains why things are suddenly moving. [hopefully] So this means tomorrow's appointment will actually, you know, happen?

494 Customer Support: Not only will it happen, but I'll be there personally to ensure everything's done right. Eight AM sharp, both repairs, plus I'm bringing space heaters for tonight.

Character 1: [grateful] Space heaters would be—that would be amazing, thank you. [emotionally] My kids have been so uncomfortable, and I just... [sighs] I just wanted someone to care.

495 Customer Support: As a parent myself, I completely understand that frustration. [quickly] The heaters will arrive within two hours, and [firmly] this won't happen again on my watch, I promise.

Character 1: [cautiously] I appreciate all this, really, but—but what about long-term? [worried] I mean, these issues keep happening, and [frustrated] I'm tired of being the squeaky wheel.

496 Customer Support: [decisively] You're right to ask about long-term solutions. We're implementing a new maintenance response system, quarterly unit inspections, and [more deliberately] a direct hotline to my office for urgent issues.

Character 1: [surprised] A direct line? That's... actually really helpful. [more relaxed] Maybe I won't have to start looking for a new place after all. [sighs] Though I already called three landlords this week.

497 Customer Support: Please don't make any decisions until after tomorrow's repairs. We value you as a tenant, and I think—no, I know—we can restore your confidence. See you at eight AM sharp.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

498 [Angry] No, no, no, you can't die on me right now—I don't even know where I'm supposed to—[Groan] this is literally the worst timing ever!

499 [Sarcastic] Oh perfect, just absolutely perfect timing, phone. [Tsk] Really outdid yourself today, didn't you?

500 [Fast] Wait, did I—did I save the address somewhere else? [Disappointed] I think it was only in the text and now I'm completely lost.

501 [Whisper] Please, please, please just give me one percent battery, that's all I need. [Slow] Come on, just turn on for like thirty seconds.

502 [Happy] You know what? [Laugh] This is actually—this is kinda freeing, being completely disconnected for once.

503 [Sad] I was, um, I was right in the middle of saying goodbye to her and it just—[Sigh] she probably thinks I hung up on purpose.

504 [Shout] Does anyone have a charger? [Fast] iPhone charger, anyone? I'll pay you twenty bucks!

505 [Disappointed] Three interviews lined up today and I can't, uh, can't even remember which building was first. [Tsk] Should've written it down old school, I guess.

506 [Slow] So let me get this straight—the GPS is dead, the emergency contacts are dead, and basically I'm just... [Chuckle] totally stranded here.

507 [Angry] I literally just charged this thing! [Fast] How is it already—what is even draining the battery this fast?

508 [Sarcastic] Sure, die right when the Uber's arriving, that's—[Laugh] that's really helpful, thanks so much for your service today.

509 [Whisper] Okay, okay, don't panic, um, there's gotta be a payphone around here somewhere, right? [Sad] Do those even exist anymore?

510 [Happy] Twenty-three percent! [Shout] It's back on! Quick, screenshot everything before it dies again!

511 [Disappointed] I mean, I knew the battery was getting bad, but—[Slow] dying during my kid's first recital video is just... yeah.

512 [Fast] The boarding pass, the boarding pass was digital and now—[Groan] they're gonna close the gate and I can't even prove I have a ticket!

513 [Sarcastic] Honestly, what did people even do before phones? [Chuckle] Oh right, they actually remembered things and carried maps.

514 [Angry] This stupid update yesterday must've—I dunno, it must've broken something because this is not normal! [Tsk] [Disappointed] Seven hundred dollar brick now.

515 [Whisper] If I just hold the power button and the, um, the volume button together maybe—[Sigh] nope, nothing, completely dead.

516 [Happy] Wait, is that—is that a charging station over there? [Fast] Oh my god, yes, yes, yes, there's actually an open port!

517 [Slow] You know what the worst part is? [Sad] I was finally winning that game after like—after three hours of trying and now it's all gone.

518 SCENARIO: Offhandedly recounting a time they interrupted someone, then counting how many times they did it, then realizing they dominated the entire conversation, spiraling into conversational bulldozing guilt

==================================================

[casual]

So, um, I had this meeting today with Sarah from, uh, from marketing, and I was telling her about the— the new campaign ideas, you know? And she starts to say something about the budget, but I was like, "Oh yeah, I already, um, I already looked into that," and just kept going with my presentation.

[matter-of-fact]

Which, like, whatever, right? I mean, I— I had good points to make, and she seemed fine with it. But then later I'm thinking about it and I'm like, wait, how many times did I, um, did I actually cut her off?

[a bit concerned]

So I'm mentally going through the meeting, and there was that budget thing, and then when she tried to mention the timeline I was like "Actually, um, actually I think we should—" and just, uh, just steamrolled right over her again. [nervous laugh] And then the vendor discussion...

[growing realization]

Oh god. Oh no. I— I think I interrupted her like, um, like six times? Seven? In a thirty-minute meeting? She barely got to, uh, to finish a single thought!

[spiraling]

What is wrong with me? I'm that person! I'm the, um, the conversation bulldozer that everyone complains about! She probably went back to her desk thinking I'm a complete, uh, complete asshole who doesn't— [groan] who doesn't give a shit about anyone else's input!

[mortified]

God, no wonder she looked so, um, so defeated by the end! I thought she was just tired, but I— I literally didn't let her speak! [whimper] I'm never gonna be able to look her in the eye again!
