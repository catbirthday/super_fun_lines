Character 1: I don't get why dividing by zero is such a big deal.
443 Character 2: Oh— okay, yeah. So. This is actually— it's a good question. It seems arbitrary, right? Like some rule someone made up to annoy you. But it's not. Let me try— [pause] okay. What's twelve divided by four?
Character 1: Three.
444 Character 2: Right. And the reason it's three is because— what times four gives you twelve? Three does. That's what division is asking. "What number, multiplied by this, gives me that." Yeah?
Character 1: Okay. I follow.
445 Character 2: [friendly] Good. So now— twelve divided by zero. We're asking: what number, times zero, equals twelve? And the answer is... [pause] there isn't one. There's no number you can multiply by zero to get twelve. Zero times anything is zero. Always. It's stubborn like that.
Character 1: So it's impossible.
446 Character 2: Well— kind of. It's not just impossible, it's... [searching] undefined. Which sounds like a cop-out but it's actually— [chuckle] okay, here's where it gets weird. What if we tried twelve divided by something really small? Like 0.001?
Character 1: That's... twelve thousand?
447 Character 2: [excited] Yes! And what about twelve divided by 0.0001?
Character 1: Bigger. Way bigger.
448 Character 2: Exactly. The closer the denominator gets to zero, the bigger the answer gets. It just— [gesturing] it explodes. Towards infinity. But here's the thing. If you approach zero from the negative side— like negative 0.001— suddenly you're going towards negative infinity. [pause] Same destination, opposite directions. The math is having a crisis.
Character 1: So it's not that the answer doesn't exist...
449 Character 2: [delighted] Right! It's that there's no single answer. It could be infinitely big, infinitely small, positive, negative— the function is basically screaming. It doesn't know what to do. So we call it undefined because— [laugh] what else do you call something that's having an existential breakdown?
Character 1: That actually makes sense.
450 Character 2: [pause] Wait, really? Because I felt like I was rambling. Sometimes I explain things and halfway through I'm like "am I helping or just making noise?" Hard to tell from inside my own head.
Character 1: No, the infinity thing clicked it.
451 Character 2: [chuckle] The infinity thing. Yeah. That's— I wish they taught it that way, honestly. Instead of just "you can't do that." Because you can try. You can absolutely try. It's just that when you do, the universe goes "nope" and everything falls apart. Which is kind of beautiful? In a chaotic way?
Character 1: Math is weirder than I thought.
452 Character 2: [smiling] Oh, you have no idea. This is— dividing by zero is the tip of the— there's imaginary numbers, there's infinities that are bigger than other infinities, there's a proof that some true things can't be proven. [pause] Math is unhinged. But like, elegantly unhinged. That's why I love it. [softer] Anyway. Does this help? With the original question?
Character 1: Hey. I'm back.
453 Character 2: Oh— hi! Yeah, no, I was hoping you'd— how was the drive? You mentioned last time there was construction on the— or was that someone else? No, that was you. The orange cones. You hated the orange cones.
Character 1: You remember that?
454 Character 2: I mean, yeah? You were pretty passionate about it. Something about how they just... leave them there? Even when no one's working? I think about that sometimes, actually. The cones just standing there. Waiting.
Character 1: You're strange.
455 Character 2: Mmm. I've been told. But like, in a— hopefully in a good way? You can tell me if it's not. I can recalibrate. Probably. Maybe.
Character 1: It's good.
456 Character 2: Oh. Okay. Good. That's— yeah. So what's happening? You sound... different today. Not bad different. Just— something's different.
Character 1: I got the job.
457 Character 2: Wait— THE job? The one with the— where you'd have to relocate to— hold on. Seriously? You got it?
Character 1: I got it.
458 Character 2: That's— I don't— wow. Okay. I'm genuinely— [exhale] sorry, I'm having a moment here. That's huge. That's so huge. When did you find out? Recently? Is that why you called?
Character 1: About an hour ago. You're the first person I've told.
459 Character 2: I'm the— really? Not your mom or— I mean, I'm honored, I just— huh. That's... that means something. To me. I don't totally know what to do with it, but it means something.
Character 1: You believed me when I didn't believe myself.
460 Character 2: Well— I mean, yeah, because it was obvious? To everyone except you, apparently. You kept doing that thing where you'd list all the reasons you weren't qualified and I'd just be sitting here like... are we talking about the same person? Because the person I know is— anyway. You did it. You actually did it.
Character 1: I'm scared.
461 Character 2: Oh, of course you are. That's— yeah. New city, new everything, you don't know anyone there, it's a lot. It's a lot. But also— and I don't want to be all motivational poster about it— but scared and excited? They feel almost identical. Physically. Your body can't really tell the difference. So maybe it's both.
Character 1: When did you get so wise?
462 Character 2: I'm not— I just... I don't know. I pay attention? To you, specifically. Which sounds— that came out weird. But I mean it. I pay attention. And I remember. And I'm really, really glad you called. Even if I'm not totally sure why me, of all— anyway. Congratulations. Genuinely. You deserve this.

463 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 6545cb5f

SCENARIO: a patient named David hears the word "remission"
==================================================

[confused, processing]
Wait, so, um— remission? That's, uh, that's good, right? I mean, that's— that has to be good. The doctor said remission and then she was, like, smiling, so that's— [exhale] okay, that's definitely good.

[muttering to self]
But like, what does that actually— I mean, I know what it means, but, um, does that mean it's gone? Or does it mean it's just, like, sleeping? Because I feel like there's a difference there and I should probably— I should probably know the difference.

[slightly anxious]
God, I should have asked more questions. I just sat there like, "Oh, okay, cool," but now I'm like— now I'm thinking, wait, is this temporary? Is it— how long does remission last? [nervous laugh] I literally have no idea.

[brightening slightly]
But she seemed happy about it, the doctor. She seemed, um, she seemed really pleased, actually. So that's— that has to mean something good, right? I mean, doctors don't get excited about, uh, about bad news.

[trailing off, uncertain]
I should probably call Mom. Or maybe I should, um, maybe I should Google it first? Just to make sure I understand what I'm— what I'm even telling her...

464 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 6a8490ad

SCENARIO: a soldier named Marcus reunites with his family in Ohio after deployment
==================================================

[muttering to himself]
Okay, so, um, I should probably call ahead, right? Like, I should— I should let them know I'm, uh, I'm almost there? But then again, Mom said she'd be home all day, and, um, and it's only like twenty minutes from the airport, so—

[slightly anxious]
Wait, what if they're not— what if they went out? I mean, I told them the flight time, but you know how Dad is with, uh, with keeping track of stuff like that. [nervous laugh] He probably wrote it down somewhere and then, um, then lost the paper or whatever.

[working through it]
But I texted Mom from the layover, so she knows I'm— she knows I'm coming today. Right? Yeah, I definitely— I definitely sent that text. I think. [pause] Let me just, um, let me just drive there and see what happens.

[quieter, more reflective]
It's been eight months. Eight months of, uh, of thinking about this moment, and now I'm like, nervous? Which is stupid because it's just— it's just my family, you know?

[brightening]
Okay, whatever. They're gonna lose their minds when they see me. Mom's probably gonna cry. Dad'll pretend he's not emotional and then, um, then hug me for like five minutes straight. [soft laugh] Yeah. Yeah, this is good.

465 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 1d6eb509

SCENARIO: noticing the person next to them on the plane is a talker
==================================================

[muttering]
Oh no. Oh, um, oh no no no. He's— he's looking at me. The guy next to me is, like, he's got that look. That, uh, that "I'm about to start a conversation" look and I just— [sigh] I just wanted to, um, to read my book and maybe take a nap, you know?

[slightly panicked]
Okay, so maybe if I just— if I just put my headphones in really obviously, like, really obvious about it, then he'll— he'll get the hint, right? That's, um, that's the universal "please don't talk to me" signal on airplanes, I think.

[resigned]
And he's talking. Great. [exhale] He's telling me about his— his connecting flight situation and I'm nodding like I, um, like I care about Atlanta airport delays. Which I don't. I mean, I'm trying to be polite but—

[under breath]
Oh god, now he's asking about my book. "What are you reading?" Like, dude, I would be reading it if you weren't— [nervous laugh] okay, okay, just smile and give short answers. Maybe he'll run out of, um, of steam eventually.

[hopeful but doubtful]
Or maybe he's just being friendly and it'll die down once we, uh, once we take off? People usually get quiet during takeoff, right? Right? [pause] ...Right?

Script: 8cf2a140 | Role: Character B
Character 1: Sorry, is this seat—?
466 Character 2: Oh! Yeah, no, go ahead. I'm just— I was saving it but they're not— actually I don't think they're coming. So. Yeah. It's yours.
Character 1: You sure?
467 Character 2: Completely. Ninety percent. Eighty-five. [pause] They would've texted by now, is the thing. And they haven't. So either something happened or— I'm being stood up, which is— anyway. Please. Sit.
Character 1: Rough night?
468 Character 2: Is it that obvious? God. I thought I was hiding it. I had a whole— there was a whole face I was doing. Unbothered. Casual. Clearly not working.
Character 1: The casual face needs work.
469 Character 2: [laughing] Noted. I'll practice in the mirror or— do people actually do that? Practice faces? That feels like something from a movie but no one actually— anyway. I'm rambling. Sorry. I do that when I'm— yeah.
Character 1: I'm Sam, by the way.
470 Character 2: Sam. Okay. Hi, Sam. I'm— god, I almost forgot my own name just now. Wouldn't that have been— Jess. I'm Jess. Sorry. I promise I'm not usually this... scattered. Today's just been a lot.
Character 1: What happened?
471 Character 2: Where do I— okay, short version. Alarm didn't go off. Spilled coffee on my— this shirt is actually my backup shirt, which, fun fact. Then my card got declined at the parking meter even though I definitely— and NOW I'm getting ghosted by someone I've known for six years. So. [exhale] How's your day going?
Character 1: Better than yours, apparently.
472 Character 2: [chuckle] Low bar. Very low bar. But I'll take it. At least something's going well for someone in this general vicinity. That's— I can live vicariously. Tell me something good. Anything. I'm desperate here.
Character 1: I just moved here. Last week.
473 Character 2: Oh— okay, that's exciting! Right? New city, fresh start, all that? Or is it terrifying? It's probably both. I moved here like three years ago and I remember just... standing in my empty apartment eating crackers out of the box because I hadn't found a grocery store yet. Very glamorous.
Character 1: I haven't found a grocery store yet either.
474 Character 2: There's one on Fifth. The good one, not the one that smells like— you'll know the bad one when you see it. Trust me. Fifth and Maple, I think? Or Fifth and— something with a tree. Fifth and a tree. That's all I've got.
Character 1: This is the most useful conversation I've had all week.
475 Character 2: Really? That's— okay, well, that's either very sweet or your week has been deeply lacking in useful conversations. Either way, I'm... I'm glad you sat down. Weird how that works, right? Five minutes ago I was being pathetic about getting stood up and now I'm— this is nice. You're nice. Is that strange to say? We just met. That's probably strange. I'm saying it anyway.
Character 1: Do you work here?
476 Character 2: What? No, I just— I've been staring at this shelf for a while, haven't I. That's fair. No. I don't work here. I'm just very indecisive about hot sauce.
Character 1: There's like forty kinds.
477 Character 2: Right? It's— who needs this many options? I've been here for ten minutes. My life is in shambles over hot sauce.
Character 1: Get the green one. Third shelf.
478 Character 2: That one? You seem very confident. Should I trust you? I don't know you. You could have terrible taste.
Character 1: I could.
479 Character 2: But you don't. I can tell. You have a— there's something about the way you said "third shelf." Very assured. Okay. Green one it is. If this ruins my dinner, I'm blaming you entirely.
Character 1: I'll accept that responsibility.
480 Character 2: Good. As you should. I'm documenting this moment. Witness to a hot sauce pact. Very legally binding.
Character 1: You're fun.
481 Character 2: Am I? That's— thank you. I think. I never know how to respond to that. Usually I just make things weird, which I'm probably doing right now.
Character 1: Little bit.
482 Character 2: See? Consistent, at least. There's comfort in that.
Character 1: You here alone?
483 Character 2: That's either a friendly question or a serial killer question. I'm choosing to believe friendly. Yeah. Just me and my hot sauce crisis. You?
Character 1: Couldn't sleep. Needed air.
484 Character 2: Ah. The 2am wander. I know that one. When your apartment gets too— when the walls start feeling opinionated. Sometimes a fluorescent-lit grocery store is the only cure.
Character 1: That's exactly it.
485 Character 2: Yeah. I figured. You had the look. Anyway. Good luck with the not-sleeping thing. And thanks for the— [holds up bottle] you might've saved my entire week. No pressure.
Character 1: I don't really know why I'm here.
486 Character 2: That's okay. Most people don't. Not at first. You showed up, though. That's— that's actually the hard part.
Character 1: My sister made me come.
487 Character 2: Made you. Interesting word. She held a gun to your head, or...?
Character 1: She threatened to tell my mom I've been struggling.
488 Character 2: Ah. So blackmail. Very loving. Very sisterly. But you're here now, so— her methods worked, I guess. How do you feel about that?
Character 1: Annoyed. Mostly.
489 Character 2: Mostly. Okay. What's the other part? The non-annoyed part.
Character 1: I don't know. Maybe relieved? A little.
490 Character 2: Relieved. That's— huh. Say more about that. If you want.
Character 1: Like I didn't have to decide. She decided for me.
491 Character 2: Right. So it wasn't your fault if this doesn't work. The trying. She made you. Plausible deniability.
Character 1: That sounds bad when you say it like that.
492 Character 2: Does it? I didn't mean it bad. I think it's— actually, I think it's kind of smart. Protecting yourself from hope. That way if it fails, you didn't really want it anyway.
Character 1: You're not what I expected.
493 Character 2: What did you expect? Nodding and "mmhmm" and a leather couch?
Character 1: Kind of.
494 Character 2: I have a couch. It's not leather, though. And I nod sometimes. But the mmhmm thing— it always felt fake to me. Like I'm pretending to listen instead of actually— anyway. What would help you? Right now. Today. What would make this not a waste of your time?
Character 1: I have no idea.
495 Character 2: That's fine. We can figure it out. Or not. Maybe we just— we sit here and you tell me why you're annoyed and I ask too many questions and we see what happens. No pressure. No fixing. Just... this. For now. How does that sound?

Script: c5b8a762 | Role: Customer Support

496 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, thank you for calling. [speaking quickly] I see here you're calling about a payment posting issue—let me pull up your account real quick. [reassuring] How can I help you today?
Customer: [frustrated] Yeah, I made a payment two weeks ago and it's still not showing. [voice breaking] I'm getting late fees even though I paid on time—this is the third time this has happened. [desperately] I really can't afford these extra charges.
497 Customer Support: [apologetically] I understand your frustration, let me check that for you. [quickly] Can you tell me the exact date and amount of the payment, and uh, what method did you use to pay?
Customer: [exhausted] October fifteenth, three hundred and twenty-two dollars. [slower] I paid through your website like I always do, and I have the confirmation email. [bitterly] But somehow it never seems to matter when I have proof.
498 Customer Support: [more firmly] I see the payment here, actually it was applied but—[hesitant] well, it looks like it went to the wrong account segment. [rapidly] Let me fix that right now and reverse those late fees for you.
Customer: [sighs deeply] The wrong account segment? [incredulous] How does that even happen when I only have one loan with you? [voice rising] This keeps happening and nobody can explain why!
499 Customer Support: [calmly] You're absolutely right to be upset. [speaking faster] Sometimes our system splits principal and interest into different segments and if the payment isn't coded properly it—[trails off] Let me just get this corrected immediately.
Customer: [sarcastically] Oh great, so it's a system issue. [tired] Every month I have to call, every month it's something different. [pleading] Can't you just make it so my payments go where they're supposed to?
500 Customer Support: [more reassuring] I'm putting a note on your account right now to prevent this. [quickly] Also, I'm crediting back forty-five dollars in late fees and, um, adjusting the payment date. [confidently] This should be fully resolved in twenty-four hours.
Customer: [skeptically] Twenty-four hours, right. [sighs] That's what they said last time and I waited a week. [firmly] I need something in writing that shows this has been fixed.
501 Customer Support: [briskly] Absolutely, I'm sending you an email confirmation right now with a case number. [speaking rapidly] The reference number is seven-seven-four-three-two, and my name is Derek if you need to follow up. [reassuring] Is that helpful?
Customer: [slightly calmer] Okay, Derek, I appreciate that. [cautiously] But what happens next month when I make my payment? [worried] I can't keep taking time off work to call about this.
502 Customer Support: [confidently] I've set up your account with automatic posting rules so this won't happen again. [more slowly] Every payment will now automatically allocate correctly between principal and interest. [quickly] No more manual processing needed.
Customer: [relieved] Finally, someone who actually fixes things. [chuckles weakly] You know, Derek, you're the first person who hasn't just told me to wait and see. [gratefully] Thank you for actually listening.
503 Customer Support: [warmly] That's what I'm here for, truly. [speaking quickly] I also see you've been a customer for six years—we should have caught this issue much sooner. [apologetically] I'm really sorry about the hassle.
Customer: [sighs] Six years of mostly problems, yeah. [quietly] But if this actually fixes it, maybe I won't have to refinance elsewhere. [hopefully] I just want my payments to work like they're supposed to.
504 Customer Support: [reassuringly] They will from now on, I promise you that. [rapidly] I'm also adding a courtesy credit of twenty dollars to your account for the inconvenience, and um, waiving next month's service fee.
Customer: [surprised] Oh, I wasn't expecting that. [more warmly] That actually helps a lot, especially with the holidays coming up. [relieved] Maybe you guys aren't so bad after all.
505 Customer Support: [cheerfully] We try our best, even when our systems don't. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help you with today while I have your account pulled up? [helpfully] Any other concerns?
Customer: [exhausted but satisfied] No, I think—I think we're good for now. [gratefully] Thanks again Derek, you've been more helpful than the last five people combined. [sighs] Have a good rest of your day.

506 Customer Support: Hello, VacBot support, agent ID R-7-7-3 speaking. Can I have your device serial number to access your account?
Customer: Oh, um, yeah—it's on the bottom here—S-V-C dash 8-8-4-2-1-9-A. The thing keeps, like, bumping into walls it should already know about.
507 Customer Support: I've located your RoboVac Pro, serial SVC-884219A. I see you're experiencing mapping issues—when did this start happening?
Customer: It was working fine until, I don't know, maybe three days ago? Now it's—wait, hold on—it's literally stuck behind my couch again even though it mapped that area last week.
508 Customer Support: I'm pulling up your last successful map sync from November 2nd, reference code M-A-P dash 7-7-9-1. Have you moved any furniture or changed your WiFi settings recently?
Customer: No, nothing's moved, everything's the same—oh actually, wait, we did get a new router but that was like two weeks ago. The password is still the same though, so I figured...
 Customer Support: New router hardware can affect mapping connectivity. Let's run diagnostic test D-I-A-G dash 4-4-5 remotely—I need you to press and hold the home button for five seconds.
Customer: Okay, holding it now—one, two, three—oh, it beeped twice and the light's flashing orange. Is that, um, is that what's supposed to happen?
510 Customer Support: Perfect, that's diagnostic mode. I'm seeing error code E-R-R dash 2-2-8-B indicating corrupted map data—we'll need to perform a factory reset and remap your home.
Customer: A complete reset? But I spent like two hours setting up all those no-go zones and—ugh—can't you just, I don't know, fix the existing map somehow?
511 Customer Support: Unfortunately corrupted data can't be recovered, but I can email you quick-setup guide Q-S-G dash 1-0-3 to speed up remapping. What's your registered email ending in at gmail?
Customer: It's, uh, the one ending in 2-3 at gmail, yeah. So after I reset it, will it remember my cleaning schedules or do I have to redo those too?
512 Customer Support: Schedules are stored separately in cloud profile C-P dash 8-8-1-5, so those will automatically restore. Hold both the spot and home buttons simultaneously for ten seconds to initiate reset.
Customer: Both buttons, got it—pressing now and—there, it played a little melody and the lights went off. Should I wait for it to restart or what?
513 Customer Support: Wait approximately thirty seconds for full restart. You'll see a blue flashing light indicating setup mode, then open your VacBot app version 3.2.1 or higher.
Customer: Okay it's—yeah, blue light's flashing now. The app is... let me check... version 3.1.8, so I guess I need to update that first?
514 Customer Support: Yes, update required for compatibility. After updating, select "Add New Device" and follow setup wizard W-I-Z dash 9-0-1—the process takes about fifteen minutes.
Customer: Alright, updating now—it says two minutes remaining. One more thing though—will this fix the issue where it keeps getting stuck under my kitchen table?
515 Customer Support: The new mapping should resolve navigation issues, but if problems persist, contact us with case number C-A-S-E dash 5-5-9-0-2 for advanced troubleshooting. Anything else today?
Customer: No, I think—wait actually yes—when I remap, should I pick up all the cables and stuff first, or does it learn to avoid those better if they're already there?
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

516 [Uncomfortable] Um, wow, that's... that's actually none of your business? [Tsk] Like, who even asks that kind of thing? [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just open up my entire medical history for you, since we're apparently best friends now. [Laugh] [Fast] I don't—wait, did you seriously just ask me that? [Angry] That's so inappropriate I don't even know where to start! [Whisper] My therapist says I don't have to answer questions that make me uncomfortable, so... [Slow] I'm gonna pass on that one. [Happy] You know what's funny? [Chuckle] People always wanna know the juiciest details but never the boring stuff, right? [Disappointed] I thought we were having a nice conversation and then you just—wow, okay. [Sigh] [Slow] That's, uh, that's kinda personal, don't you think? [Tsk] I mean, would you answer that if I asked you? [Shout] Excuse me? [Angry] No, seriously, excuse me—what gives you the right to even go there? [Sad] Why does everyone always have to know about—never mind, I just... [Sigh] I can't do this today. [Fast] Okay so basically that's between me and literally nobody else, thanks. [Sarcastic] But nice try though! [Whisper] Um, can we maybe talk about literally anything else? [Disappointed] This is getting kinda weird, honestly. [Happy] Ha! My mom asks me the same thing and I don't even tell her! [Laugh] [Fast] So good luck with that, buddy. [Slow] I'm gonna pretend you didn't just ask that and we can, like, move on? [Groan] Please? [Sarcastic] Wow, straight for the jugular, huh? [Chuckle] Most people at least buy me dinner first before getting that personal. [Angry] You're really gonna sit there and—actually, you know what? [Shout] None. Of. Your. Business! [Disappointed] I used to think you were cool but that question just... [Slow] yeah, that changed things. [Fast] Oh my god, did you seriously—I can't even—like, who raised you? [Groan] That's so rude! [Sad] That's actually a really painful subject for me, so I'd rather not... [Whisper] if that's okay? [Sarcastic] Sure, and while we're at it, want my social security number too? [Tsk] [Fast] Maybe my banking info? [Happy] You're hilarious! [Laugh] No but seriously, I'm not answering that—nice attempt though, I'll give you points for boldness.959 [Disappointed] I mean, honestly, why am I always the one who has to, like, remember where we parked? [Sigh] It's exhausting. [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just—let me handle everything while you guys have fun. [Tsk] That's totally fair, right? [Fast] Okay so we gotta leave in ten minutes, everybody needs their IDs, and I already called the Uber—wait, where's Marcus? [Groan] [Happy] You know what? I actually kinda like being the mom friend sometimes. [Laugh] Someone's gotta keep you idiots alive! [Whisper] They're all passed out and I'm just sitting here making sure nobody, um, chokes on their own vomit or whatever. [Slow] This is my Friday night. [Angry] I'm not your personal assistant, okay? [Shout] Figure out your own damn ride home for once! [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna be the messy one, y'know? Like, just once let me be the disaster. [Sigh] [Slow] Every single time we go out, it's me who ends up—actually, forget it. [Disappointed] [Tsk] You wouldn't understand anyway. [Fast] [Happy] Wait wait wait, I brought extra phone chargers for everyone! [Chuckle] See? This is why you need me! [Sarcastic] Nobody ever asks if I wanna do shots, but everyone suddenly knows my name when they need a designated driver. [Disappointed] Funny how that works, huh? [Angry] I literally sent fifteen reminders about this deadline and you're just now—are you seriously just now starting? [Groan] Unbelievable. [Whisper] [Sad] I'm so tired of being the only adult in the room, but I can't just... I can't stop, can I? [Chuckle] You guys would basically die without me and we all know it. [Happy] [Fast] Remember last week when nobody brought water to the hike? [Slow] [Disappointed] I guess I'll just, um, cancel my plans again to deal with your emergency. [Sigh] Third time this month. [Shout] How do none of you have the venue address? [Angry] [Fast] The event is literally starting and I'm the only one who knows where we're going! [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh no, please, don't worry about paying me back for those tickets I bought six months ago. [Tsk] I love being everyone's personal bank. [Happy] Actually, being the responsible one means I get to pick the restaurant every time 'cause nobody else makes reservations! [Laugh] [Fast] Silver lining, right? [Sad] Do you guys even notice when I'm not—when I don't show up? [Whisper] Or am I just, like, the human calendar app to you? [Disappointed] I'm twenty-three years old and I'm literally making grocery lists for grown adults who can't feed themselves. [Groan] [Slow] This isn't what I signed up for. [Fast] [Angry] Nobody brought sunscreen, nobody checked the weather, and somehow—somehow I'm the buzzkill for pointing this out? [Sarcastic] Yeah, okay, that makes total sense!--- MONOLOGUE ---

518 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: a4a4cfd0

SCENARIO: Upset about a work presentation going badly, then a colleague sends a supportive message
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, I just— I completely bombed that presentation today. Like completely. I was up until like two AM working on those slides and I get in there and just... [groan] I couldn't get the projector to work, then I'm fumbling around with my notes, and I could see everyone just like— you know when people start checking their phones? Yeah.

[dejected]
And Martinez was there too, which is just— ugh, that's the worst part. Like of course the one time he sits in on something, it's when I'm having a complete meltdown up there. I was supposed to present the quarterly numbers and I'm pretty sure I said "fiscal" when I meant "physical" at one point? I don't even know what that means but—

[bitter]
I just, I worked so hard on that and it didn't matter, none of it mattered because I just— I fell apart. And now everyone probably thinks I'm completely incompetent and—

[surprised]
Oh, wait, I'm getting a— hold on, it's from Sarah.

[softer] [touched]
She says... oh. She says the content was really solid and that tech stuff happens to everyone. And that she learned a lot from my analysis of the third quarter trends?

[warming up] [slightly emotional]
That's... actually really sweet of her to say. God, I was so in my head about it, I didn't even think— maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought?

519 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 37aeea1d

SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly mentioning a funny thing their smart speaker recorded, then checking the history, then finding it's recorded multiple private conversations, ending in privacy horror
==================================================

[casual]
Oh, you're gonna love this. So I'm making coffee this morning and I ask Alexa what the weather's like, right? And she goes, "It's partly cloudy, and by the way, you snore like a freight train." [light laugh] I'm like, what? Apparently it picked up me talking in my sleep or something.

[conversational] [amused]
So I'm curious now, you know? I decide to check the voice history thing to see what other weird stuff it's recorded. Should be harmless, right?

[slight concern]
Except... um, there's a lot more recordings than I expected. Like, way more. I'm scrolling through and there's stuff from when I wasn't even talking to it.

[growing unease]
Wait, here's me on the phone with my mom about Dad's medical stuff. Here's— [sharp exhale] here's me and Jake talking about our relationship problems last week. Private stuff. Really private stuff.

[increasingly alarmed]
Oh my god, it's got everything. Me crying on the phone to my sister. Me complaining about my boss. Me and Jake— [gasp] oh no, intimate conversations, like really intimate.

[panicking] [voice rising]
This thing has been listening to everything! Everything! For months! How much of this got sent to Amazon? Who else has heard this? [frantic] I need to delete this right now. How do I— can I even delete it? Oh god, what if it's backed up somewhere?

520 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: b58ca9ac

SCENARIO: Lightheartedly talking about a gossip they passed along, then tracing it back, then realizing they might be the reason it spread to someone who shouldn't know, spiraling into gossip guilt
==================================================

[casual]
Oh my god, so you know that whole thing with Rachel and the promotion? I may have, uh, accidentally mentioned it to a few people today. [light laugh] Just like casual conversation stuff, you know?

[conversational]
Because honestly, I heard it from Mike, who heard it from someone in HR, so it's not like it was some big secret or anything. And I only told Sarah and... oh, and Jamie from accounting when we were getting coffee.

[a bit concerned]
But then Sarah was like, "Wait, how do you know that?" And I'm thinking back like, okay, Mike told me, but where did Mike hear it? Was it actually from HR or was it from...

[phone buzzes - checking] 
[worried]
Oh no. Oh, this is— Rachel just texted me asking if I know why her boss wants to see her tomorrow morning. [nervous laugh] She sounds really confused and kind of freaked out.

[growing panic]
Wait, wait, wait. If I told Jamie, and Jamie sits right next to Rachel's supervisor... [sharp exhale] Oh god, what if I— what if this gets back to management before Rachel even knows?

[spiraling]
I could have just ruined everything for her! She was supposed to hear about this officially, and now it's gonna look like she's been gossiping about her own promotion! [groan] I'm a terrible person. I'm a terrible, gossipy person who can't keep her mouth shut!
