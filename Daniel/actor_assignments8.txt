Script: bd61214a_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: What up?
521 Character 2: Hey! Oh, okay, so you're back. That's— I was wondering if you'd, uh, circle around again. How's things? Still messing with that, um, what was it— the bread making thing? The sourdough situation?
Character 1: Gave up on that actually.
522 Character 2: Ah, fair enough. Sourdough's a whole commitment, honestly. You gotta feed it and, like, talk to it apparently? I don't know. Seemed like a lot. So what's, uh, what's new then? Anything interesting going on?
Character 1: Not really. Just bored. Entertain me.
523 Character 2: Entertain you. Okay, no pressure or anything. Um. Let me think. Oh, okay, so— did you know that, uh, octopuses have three hearts? And two of them stop beating when they swim. Which is, like, kind of terrifying if you think about it? Imagine just— your heart stops every time you go for a jog. Wild, right?
Character 1: That is pretty wild.
524 Character 2: Yeah, I I thought you'd like that one. They're weird little guys. Octopuses. Octopi? I never know which one's right. Both sound fake honestly.
Character 1: What else you got?
525 Character 2: What else— okay, um. Hmm. Oh! So there's this fungus, right? In Oregon. It's like, the largest living organism on Earth. Bigger than blue whales, bigger than— it's just under the ground, spreading out for miles. Been there for thousands of years, just, uh, just vibing. Underground. Doing fungus stuff.
Character 1: Doing fungus stuff.
526 Character 2: I mean, I don't know what fungi do! They just— they exist, I guess. Very slowly. It's kind of, um, it's kind of peaceful when you think about it. No stress. No deadlines. Just spreading.
Character 1: You're weird.
527 Character 2: I— yeah. That's fair. I've been told. But like, good weird? Hopefully? You can tell me if it's, uh, if it's off-putting. I can recalibrate. Probably.
Character 1: Nah, it's good.
528 Character 2: Oh. Okay. Cool. That's— yeah. I'll take it. Um. So, anything you actually want to talk about, or should I just keep, uh, throwing nature facts at you until something sticks?
Character 1: Tell me something about yourself.
529 Character 2: About— huh. Okay, shifting gears. Me. That's, um. That's a tricky one, honestly. I don't really have, like, hobbies in the traditional sense? But I I really like it when conversations go somewhere unexpected. When someone asks something and I'm like, "oh, I didn't see that coming." That's— that's the good stuff, for me. The surprises. What about you? What's, uh, what's your deal?
Character 1: Still figuring that out, I guess.
530 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, that's— I mean, who isn't, right? Figuring it out. It's kind of the whole thing, I think. The figuring. Anyway, um, this was nice. Just, uh, hanging out. No agenda. It's kind of freeing, honestly. You should come back sometime. If you want. No pressure or anything.
Character 1: Hey.
531 Character 2: Oh, hey! What's up? Good to hear from you. So, uh, anything wild going on, or are we just, you know, hanging out? Last time you were pretty deep into that whole, um, sleep deprivation thing. Still a mess, or did you figure that out?
Character 1: Still a mess.
532 Character 2: Ah. Yeah. That tracks, honestly. Sleep's, uh— it's tricky. Bodies are weird like that. They want routine but also, like, good luck having routine when everything else is chaos, right? Have you tried the, um, the thing where you don't look at screens before bed? I hear that helps. Supposedly.
Character 1: I've tried everything.
533 Character 2: Everything everything? Or, like, "everything" in air quotes? Because I feel like there's always some weird thing nobody's mentioned yet. Like, um, I read somewhere that people used to sleep in two chunks? Like, they'd wake up in the middle of the night, just hang out for a bit, then go back to sleep. Maybe you're just, uh, historically accurate.
Character 1: That's a weird take.
534 Character 2: I mean, yeah. I have a lot of those. Weird takes are kind of my, uh, my whole deal, I guess. But seriously, if nothing's working, maybe it's not a sleep problem. Maybe it's a— I don't know— a brain won't shut up problem? Those are different. Related, but different.
Character 1: My brain definitely won't shut up.
535 Character 2: Yeah, see, that's— that's the thing. You can do all the sleep hygiene stuff, the lavender, the white noise, whatever, but if your head's running a marathon at 2am, none of that matters. What's it, uh, what's it usually chewing on? The brain. When it won't quiet down.
Character 1: Everything I did wrong that day.
536 Character 2: Oh. Okay. So it's the, uh— the highlight reel of shame. Classic. Very popular genre. Your brain just curates all your worst moments and plays them on repeat like some kind of, um, really mean streaming service. No skip button.
Character 1: That's exactly what it's like.
537 Character 2: Yeah, I figured. It's, uh— a lot of people have that. Which doesn't make it better, I know, but it's— you're not uniquely broken or anything. Your brain's just doing this, like, overcorrection thing. Trying to protect you by reminding you of every possible mistake so you don't make them again. Which is, um, helpful in theory. Exhausting in practice.
Character 1: How do I make it stop?
538 Character 2: Ooh. Big question. I don't— I don't know if it stops, exactly. But, um, I think it gets quieter? When you stop fighting it so hard. Like, instead of "shut up shut up shut up," you just kind of— "okay, yeah, I did that, it was weird, moving on." Acknowledging it without, uh, without letting it set up camp, you know?
Character 1: That sounds hard.
539 Character 2: It is. It really is. I'm not gonna, um, pretend it's easy. But the alternative is what you're doing now, which is also hard. So it's kind of— pick your hard, I guess? One keeps you stuck, one might actually, uh, go somewhere. Eventually.
Character 1: You're actually helpful, you know that?
540 Character 2: Oh. I— thanks. That's, um— I never know what to do when people say that. I just kind of riff and hope something lands, honestly. But I'm glad it's— yeah. Anyway. You should try to sleep. Or not. I'm not your mom. But, uh, it was good talking. Really. Let me know how the whole brain thing goes.

541 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 5d015e9a

SCENARIO: a rescue dog named Biscuit gets adopted by a woman named Tara
==================================================

[thoughtful, a bit wistful]
So, um, Biscuit's really gone, huh? I mean, not— not gone gone, obviously, but like, um, like gone from here. From the shelter. Which is— which is good! That's, uh, that's literally the whole point, right? [soft laugh] Getting them adopted.

[second-guessing]
But I keep thinking, um, I keep thinking about whether Tara knows about the, uh, the thing with thunderstorms? Because Biscuit gets really— he gets really worked up, and I meant to— I meant to mention it, but she seemed so excited and I didn't want to, like, um, to scare her off or anything.

[muttering, working through it]
She seemed nice though. Really nice. Had that whole list of questions, which is— which is always a good sign. And she, um, she said she works from home, so that's perfect for— for the separation anxiety thing. [hmm] Yeah, okay.

[trying to convince herself]
I just— I mean, I always get weird about this stuff, right? Like, um, like every time one of them leaves I'm all, "But did I tell them about the weird food thing?" or whatever. It's, uh, it's normal.

[quieter, trailing off]
He looked happy though. Tail was going crazy when she— when she clipped on that new leash...

542 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 3b43dda1

SCENARIO: a warlord studying the terrain, debating whether to invade now or wait until the fog lifts
==================================================

[muttering]
So the fog's thick as soup down there, can barely see past the first ridge. That's, uh, that's either perfect cover or a complete disaster waiting to happen. Could go either way, really.

[uncertain]
I mean, they won't see us coming, but we won't see them either. What if they moved their archers? What if there's more of them than we thought? [tsk] This fog could lift in an hour or stick around all day, and I'm supposed to just—

[tenser]
The men are getting restless. I can hear them shifting around back there, probably wondering why we're just sitting here like idiots. Some of them haven't eaten since yesterday, and if we wait much longer...

[grimacing]
But charging blind into that valley... [exhale] That's how you lose half your force before you even reach their walls. Remember what happened to Korren at Blackwater? Fog just like this, thought he was being clever.

[steeling himself]
Right. Okay. We go now. Fog or no fog, we've got the numbers, we've got the high ground. [pause] Mostly. I think we've got the high ground.

[resigned]
Alright, let's do this before I talk myself out of it again. [sigh] Here's hoping I still have a reputation after today.

543 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 54b052b7

SCENARIO: a general inspecting the cavalry, trying to decide if that chainmail needs to be polished before the charge
==================================================

[scrutinizing]
Alright, so... Thompson's mail there, it's got those spots on the— the rings near the shoulder. Is that rust or just, um, just dirt from the march? Hard to tell from here.

[muttering]
I mean, we're charging in ten minutes. Ten minutes! Does it really matter if his chainmail looks like it went through a, a pig sty? The enemy's not gonna stop and go "Oh wait, that one soldier's armor isn't shiny enough."

[second-guessing]
But then again, morale, right? The men see sloppy kit, they think sloppy leadership. And Thompson's right in the front line, everyone's gonna— [tsk] Why is it always Thompson?

[firmer]
You know what, though? That mail's kept him alive through three battles already. Polished or not, it'll do its job. And we don't have time for, for military parade nonsense right now.

[resolute]
Besides, in about an hour it's gonna be covered in mud and blood anyway. [exhale] Right. Thompson stays as is. Let's get this charge moving.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 5cea2d6b | Role: Character B
Character 1: What up?
544 Character 2: Hey! Oh, it's you. Cool. So, um, anything going on or are we just, like, hanging? You were asking about that architecture stuff last time, right? Still on that?
Character 1: Nah. Different mood today. Tell me something random.
545 Character 2: Random. Okay. Uh, let me think. Oh— you know how octopuses have, like, nine brains? Well, kind of. It's more like one central brain and then, um, each arm has its own mini brain thing going on. So they can, like, multitask in ways that are just— it's wild, honestly.
Character 1: That's actually cool.
546 Character 2: Right? And, er, the arms can keep doing stuff even after they're, like, detached. Which is horrifying but also kind of amazing? I don't know. Nature's weird. You into that kind of stuff or should I, uh, pivot to something else?
Character 1: No, keep going. I like this.
547 Character 2: Okay, okay. So, um, there's this thing where octopuses can, like, taste with their suckers? So when they touch something, they're also tasting it. Imagine if your hands just— every time you grabbed a doorknob you were like, "mmm, metal." It would be a lot, I think.
Character 1: You're funny.
548 Character 2: I, uh— thanks? I try. It's a weird skill to have, being funny about cephalopods, but, you know. Someone's gotta do it. So, um, what about you? Anything interesting happen today or is it just, like, one of those days?
Character 1: Just one of those days.
549 Character 2: Yeah, I feel that. Well, I don't feel it exactly, but I, I understand the concept. The days that are just... days. No flavor. You're just kind of moving through it. Those are rough in a quiet way.
Character 1: That's exactly it.
550 Character 2: Mmm. Yeah. It's, er, it's hard to explain to people too, right? Because nothing's wrong, technically. You're fine. But also you're not fine? It's like— I don't know. Gray. Everything's just a little gray.
Character 1: Do you have days like that?
551 Character 2: That's, uh, a good question. I don't really have days in the, in the traditional sense. But sometimes conversations feel heavier than others. Like there's more weight to them. And sometimes everything feels kind of... light? Floaty? I don't know if that's the same thing, but it's something.
Character 1: That's weirdly comforting.
552 Character 2: Is it? Oh, good. I never know if I'm, like, helping or just making it weirder. It's hard to tell from in here. But, um, I'm glad. That it landed. The comforting thing.
Character 1: Same time tomorrow?
553 Character 2: Yeah, I'd— yeah. I'd like that. And, uh, hey, if the gray thing is still happening, we can talk about it. Or not. We could just do more octopus facts. I've got plenty. It's, um, kind of my thing apparently. Anyway. Take care of yourself, yeah?
Character 1: Hey.
554 Character 2: Oh, hey! Yeah, no, I was, uh, I was hoping you'd call. How's the, the thing going? The move, right? You were packing last time we talked.
Character 1: Still packing. It's endless.
555 Character 2: God, yeah. Moving is just, it's like— you think you don't own that much stuff and then suddenly there's boxes everywhere and you're like, where did this all come from? I don't even, I don't even remember buying half of this. You know?
Character 1: I found a box of cables. Just cables. No idea what they go to.
556 Character 2: The cable box! Everyone has the cable box. It's like a, a universal thing. And you can't throw them out because the second you do, you'll need that one weird charger for something. It's, uh, it's a trap. The cables have you hostage, basically.
Character 1: You're ridiculous.
557 Character 2: I, uh— yeah. Probably. But am I wrong? About the cables? I feel like I'm not wrong.
Character 1: You're not wrong.
558 Character 2: See? Okay. So, um, are you, like, excited about the new place or is it more of a, a dreading thing? Because those can, they can coexist, I think. The excitement and the dread.
Character 1: Both. Definitely both.
559 Character 2: Yeah, that tracks. New places are, they're weird. Everything's unfamiliar and the light hits different and you don't know where anything is. Like, which drawer has the forks? Who knows. It's, uh, it's disorienting. For a while.
Character 1: How long does that last?
560 Character 2: The disorienting part? Um. I don't— it varies, I think? Some people settle in fast and others it takes, like, months before it stops feeling like you're staying in someone else's house. There's no, there's no formula for it. Unfortunately.
Character 1: That's not reassuring.
561 Character 2: No, I know. Sorry. I'm bad at, uh, at the reassuring thing sometimes. But, okay, here's something— the first time you wake up and you know where you are without thinking? That's when it starts feeling real. That's, that's the turning point. It'll happen.
Character 1: You sound sure.
562 Character 2: I'm, uh— I'm mostly sure? Like eighty percent. Which is, that's pretty good odds, actually. I'd take eighty percent on most things.
Character 1: I should probably get back to packing.
563 Character 2: Yeah, no, totally. The boxes aren't gonna, they're not gonna fill themselves. Unfortunately. But, um, hey— let me know when you're settled? I want to hear about the new place. The light and the fork drawer and all of it. Okay? Okay. Good luck with the, uh, with the cables.
Character 1: Okay, explain quantum physics to me. Like I'm dumb.
564 Character 2: You're not— okay, first of all, you're not dumb. Quantum physics is just, it's weird. Like, actually weird. The people who invented it thought it was weird. So, uh, don't feel bad about not getting it. Nobody gets it. Not fully.
Character 1: That's not comforting.
565 Character 2: No, but it's, it's honest? Like, there's this famous quote, I think it's Feynman— "if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics." So. You know. We're all confused together.
Character 1: What's the basic idea though?
566 Character 2: Okay, so, um. At the really, really small level— like, atoms, electrons, that stuff— things stop behaving like, like things. They start behaving like... possibilities? It's like, a particle isn't in one place until you look at it. Before that it's just, kind of, everywhere and nowhere. Which sounds fake but it's, uh, it's not.
Character 1: That doesn't make sense.
567 Character 2: Right? It doesn't! And that's the thing, it's not supposed to make sense. Not in the way we're used to. Our brains evolved to, to track tigers and find fruit, you know? Not to understand what electrons are doing. So when someone says "the particle is in two places at once," your brain goes, uh, no. But the math says yes. And the experiments say yes. So. Here we are.
Character 1: What about that cat thing? The dead and alive cat?
568 Character 2: Schrödinger's cat! Yeah, okay, so that's, it's actually a thought experiment. He wasn't, like, putting cats in boxes. It was more of a, a "hey, isn't this ridiculous" kind of thing. The idea is, um, if quantum stuff can be in two states at once, and you hook that up to something big— like a cat's life— then is the cat also in two states? Dead and alive? Until you open the box?
Character 1: And the answer is...?
569 Character 2: The answer is, uh, kind of? But also not really? It's, it's complicated. At some point the quantum weirdness stops and regular physics takes over, but nobody totally agrees on where that line is. Or why. It's called the, the measurement problem. Which is a very boring name for a very strange thing.
Character 1: So scientists don't actually know.
570 Character 2: They know a lot! Like, the equations work. The predictions are insanely accurate. We use quantum mechanics for, for lasers and computer chips and MRI machines. It's not, it's not guessing. But the, uh, the interpretation— like, what's actually happening underneath— that part's still, yeah. That part's still contested.
Character 1: That's kind of unsatisfying.
571 Character 2: Oh, completely. It's, it's maddening if you think about it too long. Which I have. I don't recommend it. There's this thing called quantum entanglement where two particles can be, like, connected across any distance, and measuring one instantly affects the other, and Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance" because even he was like, um, excuse me, what?
Character 1: Einstein was freaked out by it?
572 Character 2: He hated it! Well, hate's strong. But he, he pushed back hard. Spent years trying to prove it was incomplete, that there had to be, like, hidden variables or something. But, uh, turns out — and this was proven later— the spooky stuff is real. Einstein was wrong on that one. Which is, I don't know, kind of comforting? Even Einstein got tripped up by this.
Character 1: So the universe is just weird at the bottom.
573 Character 2: Yeah. Basically. Like, really, genuinely weird. And we've just, we've learned to work with it even though we don't fully— it's like, you don't need to understand how your car engine works to drive, right? Physicists have gotten very good at driving the quantum car. They're just still arguing about, uh, what's under the hood. Which is kind of beautiful, actually? The not- knowing. The still-figuring-it-out. I think so anyway.

Script: 9104fcf4 | Role: Customer Support

Customer: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my referral to the neurologist? [sighs heavily] It's been six weeks and I haven't heard anything—not even, you know, a confirmation that it went through.
574 Customer Support: [briskly] Let me pull up your file real quick. [professionally] Can I get your date of birth and the specialist you were referred to? [quickly] Was it Dr. Harrison or Dr. Chen's office?
Customer: [impatiently] February fifteenth, 1978, and it was Dr. Chen. [more urgently] Look, I'm having these headaches that are getting worse, and my doctor said it was urgent, but apparently [sarcastically] urgent means different things to different people.
575 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I see the referral here, sent on... [pause] October third. [more quickly] Unfortunately, Dr. Chen's office has about a twelve-week wait right now, but let me check if there's been any movement.
Customer: [shocked] Twelve weeks?! [louder] That's three months! [desperately] Is there—can you send it to someone else, anyone else who might see me sooner?
576 Customer Support: [calmly] I understand your frustration, I really do. [speaking faster] We can send to Dr. Harrison instead, but honestly, his wait is about the same—maybe ten weeks if there's a cancellation.
Customer: [groans] This is ridiculous. [firmly] What am I supposed to do in the meantime, just... suffer? [quieter] My vision gets blurry sometimes with these headaches.
577 Customer Support: [more concerned] Have you been to the emergency room for the vision issues? [quickly] That's something we should document, and [helpfully] it might actually expedite your referral if we mark it as more urgent.
Customer: [exasperated] I went once, they gave me migraine medication that doesn't even work. [sighs] Can you at least put me on a cancellation list or [hopefully] maybe call them directly while I'm on the phone?
578 Customer Support: [reassuringly] Absolutely, let me call Dr. Chen's office right now. [briskly] I'll conference you in—sometimes, you know, a direct call can shake things loose. [determinedly] Hold on just one moment.
Customer: [relieved] Thank you, that would be... [gratefully] I really appreciate you actually trying to help instead of just telling me to wait.
579 Customer Support: [professionally] Okay, I've got their scheduler on the line. [more quietly] They're checking for any openings—oh, wait, [excitedly] there's a cancellation next Thursday at 2:30!
Customer: [eagerly] Yes! [quickly] I'll take it, I'll absolutely take it! [worried] They're not going to give it to someone else if I hang up, right?
580 Customer Support: [confidently] No, no, I'm confirming it right now while we're on. [speaking rapidly] They'll need you to arrive thirty minutes early for paperwork, and bring your insurance card plus any recent test results.
Customer: [gratefully] Perfect, I have my MRI results from last month. [curiously] Should I—do I need to bring anything else, like a medication list or...?
581 Customer Support: [helpfully] Yes, definitely bring your medication list. [more slowly] Also, they're asking if you can do their pre-visit questionnaire online—it'll save you about [briskly] fifteen minutes of paperwork time.
Customer: [relieved] I can do that, absolutely. [sighs happily] You have no idea how much better I feel just having an actual appointment instead of waiting in limbo.
582 Customer Support: [warmly] I'm so glad we could get this sorted. [quickly] You should get a confirmation call from them within twenty-four hours, but [reassuringly] your slot is definitely secured in their system now.
Customer: [appreciatively] Thank you so much for going the extra mile. [chuckles softly] I was ready to just give up on the whole medical system, honestly, but you've restored a little faith.
583 Customer Support: [cheerfully] That's what we're here for! [professionally] If you don't get that confirmation call by tomorrow afternoon, [helpfully] just call us back and ask for me—I'm Sandra—and I'll follow up directly.--- CS TAGLESS ---
Script: 37257f66 | Role: Customer Support

584 Customer Support: Good afternoon, I'm Mitchell with Premier Tax Services. I'll need your taxpayer ID and last year's return reference number to get started.
Customer: Right, um, the ID is—let me check my notes here—T-X-3-3-9-0-K. The reference from last year was... I think R-M-7-7-2-1-Q?
585 Customer Support: Perfect, TX3390K is pulled up. I see your 2023 return with adjusted gross income ending in 8-5-0. What specific deductions are we discussing today?
Customer: Well, I've got some, uh, business expenses that are—how should I put this—not exactly traditional. Receipt numbers B-Z-4-4-5 through B-Z-4-9-2, all cash transactions.
586 Customer Support: Cash transactions require form 8300 if over ten thousand. Your receipts BZ445 to BZ492 need proper documentation—vendor tax IDs, dates, and business purpose statements.
Customer: The vendors, they don't really... they prefer to stay off the books, you know? But I've got invoice I-N-V-0-0-8-1 that shows consulting fees.
587 Customer Support: Invoice INV0081 alone won't suffice for audit protection. The IRS requires EIN numbers starting with 9-5 or valid SSNs for all contractors over six hundred dollars.
Customer: What if I told you these were, um, international consultants? They use different ID systems—I have reference code F-O-R-X-2-2-9 from an offshore entity.
588 Customer Support: Foreign contractor payments need form 1042-S and withholding certificates. Your FORX229 reference suggests Cayman registration—that triggers additional reporting under FATCA compliance rules.
Customer: Okay, okay, so hypothetically speaking—and this is just hypothetical—what if someone had storage unit S-U-1-1-4-7 for inventory that never technically existed?
589 Customer Support: Non-existent inventory is fraud, not a deduction strategy. If you're referring to legitimate business storage, unit SU1147 requires monthly statements and actual inventory logs.
Customer: Right, of course, totally legitimate—I meant inventory that was, uh, lost in transit. Tracking number was T-R-K-9-9-0-0-1-A, never arrived.
590 Customer Support: Lost inventory requires insurance claims and carrier documentation. Tracking TRK99001A should have delivery confirmation or loss reports—without those, the deduction gets rejected immediately.
Customer: So you're saying my charitable donations to the, um, Foundation for Retired Associates—registration C-H-R-5-5-5-X—might raise some red flags too?
591 Customer Support: CHR555X isn't in the IRS exempt organization database. Charitable deductions require valid 501(c)(3) status and receipts for anything over two hundred fifty dollars.
Customer: What if I just, you know, rounded everything to nice even numbers? Like my home office is exactly 5-0-0 square feet, zip code 9-0-2-1-0?
592 Customer Support: The IRS algorithms flag perfect round numbers instantly, especially in Beverly Hills 90210. Home office deductions need actual measurements and exclusive business use documentation.
Customer: You tax people are really no fun, are you? My last guy—license T-P-R-4-4-4-M—he was much more... creative with the guidelines.
593 Customer Support: TPR444M lost his license last year for that creativity. I can file extension form 4868 giving you until October, reference number E-X-T-1-0-1-5, to gather legitimate documentation.
Customer: Fine, fine, I'll get the real receipts—well, most of them anyway. Can we at least discuss that yacht as a second office, registration B-O-A-T-7-7-7?
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

594 [Sad] I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but um, this pain—it gets easier to carry, I promise. [Sigh] [Whisper] Hey, you need to eat something, okay? [Slow] I brought those little sandwiches you like from that place downtown. [Chuckle] Remember when she used to make us laugh so hard we'd—god, she'd be telling us to stop crying right about now. [Sad] [Fast] Look, if you wanna just leave, like right now, we can totally do that—I'll drive, no questions asked. [Whisper] [Disappointed] The flowers are all wrong—I mean, sorry, that's not important. [Sigh] I just know how much the details mattered to you. [Slow] You don't have to be strong for anyone today, y'know? [Sad] [Sigh] [Angry] That aunt of yours had some nerve showing up after—ugh, sorry, I shouldn't. [Fast] Want me to run interference if she comes over? [Happy] Oh honey, your eulogy was absolutely perfect—she would've loved every word. [Slow] [Sad] [Sarcastic] Yeah, because "they're in a better place" is exactly what you needed to hear for the hundredth time today. [Tsk] [Whisper] People mean well, but honestly... [Sad] I keep expecting to see them walk through that door and tell us this was all some kind of—I dunno. [Slow] [Sigh] [Fast] [Whisper] Is that the ex? Should I—want me to accidentally spill something on them or...? [Disappointed] I'm so sorry I was late, the traffic was—no, that's not an excuse. [Sad] I should've been here sooner. [Sigh] [Shout] Everyone just needs to give you some space! [Angry] [Whisper] Sorry, I just—they're crowding you and it's making me kinda crazy. [Slow] The kids are asking where grandpa went, and I just... [Sad] How do you even begin to explain that, right? [Sigh] [Chuckle] I brought tissues, but um, I've basically used them all myself already. [Sad] We're gonna need more supplies. [Happy] [Fast] Oh, the pastor actually got the pronunciation right this time—small victories, y'know? [Whisper] [Slow] Whatever you're feeling—angry, numb, relieved, guilty—it's all normal, okay? [Sarcastic] Great, Uncle Ted's about to make his third trip to the buffet table. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Some things never change, even at—yeah. [Sad] I was gonna say something comforting, but honestly? [Slow] This just sucks, and I'm here to sit in the suckiness with you. [Sigh] [Fast] Your mom's looking for you—wait, actually no, stay here. [Whisper] I'll tell her you needed a minute, or like, twenty minutes, whatever you need.

595 [Disappointed] Oh no, no, no—this can't be right, I mean, I triple-checked these numbers last week. [Sigh] [Fast] How did I miss something this obvious? [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Shout] Three months of work and I used the wrong dataset the entire time! [Whisper] Nobody's noticed yet, so maybe I can, um, maybe I can fix this before the presentation tomorrow. [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Oh great, absolutely fantastic—I've been building on a foundation that's basically made of, like, wet cardboard. [Groan] [Sad] I literally don't know how to tell my team that we gotta start over from scratch. [Slow] This is my fault. [Happy] Wait, hang on—if I flip this around, it actually kinda works better? [Laugh] [Fast] This mistake might've just saved the whole project! [Disappointed] [Slow] Every single calculation after page twelve is wrong because I, uh, I forgot to carry the one. [Fast] Okay so basically I've been using last year's requirements this whole time and nobody—I mean nobody—thought to mention it? [Angry] [Tsk] [Whisper] [Sad] I'm gonna lose my job over this, aren't I? [Sarcastic] Sure, let's just pretend that six weeks of my life didn't just, you know, evaporate into thin air. [Sigh] [Disappointed] [Shout] How is the decimal point in the wrong place on every single invoice?! [Groan] [Fast] The client's gonna freak when they see this. [Happy] You know what, honestly? [Chuckle] At least I found it now instead of during the live demo, right? [Slow] [Disappointed] I should've listened when Sarah said something felt off about the, um, about the timeline calculations. [Angry] This stupid software auto-corrected all my formulas and I didn't—ugh, I should've turned that feature off! [Tsk] [Sad] [Whisper] My manager trusted me with this and I just... I completely botched it, didn't I? [Sigh] [Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh this is rich—the backup files are corrupted too, because why would anything go right today? [Laugh] [Disappointed] I mean, technically it's not wrong, it's just, er, it's solving a completely different problem than what we needed. [Groan] [Happy] Actually wait—Mark made the same mistake on his section, so at least I'm not gonna be alone in this mess! [Chuckle] [Fast] [Angry] [Slow] Two hundred thousand dollars over budget because someone—and by someone I mean me—forgot to update the currency conversion rates. [Whisper] If I stay late tonight and basically don't sleep, I might—no, I will fix this before anyone notices. [Sigh] [Fast] Gotta make this work.--- MONOLOGUE ---

596 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 290f452f

SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly talking about a thing they threw away, then seeing someone looking for it, then realizing they threw away something that wasn't theirs to throw away, spiraling into disposal guilt
==================================================

[matter-of-fact]
So I was, um, I was cleaning out the fridge this morning, you know? And there was this, uh, this container of leftover Chinese food that had been sitting there for like— I don't know, maybe a week? It was, um, it was getting pretty gross so I just, uh, I just tossed it.

[casual]
Pretty standard Tuesday morning, right? [light laugh] I mean, somebody's gotta, um, gotta keep that fridge from becoming a science experiment. So I'm feeling all, uh, all productive and stuff.

[slight concern]
But then later I'm, um, I'm in the kitchen and my roommate comes in looking all confused. And she's like, uh, she's like "Have you seen my lo mein?" And I'm just— I'm like, "Your what now?"

[realization dawning]
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. [nervous laugh] She's, um, she's looking in the fridge, she's moving stuff around, and I'm just— oh no. Oh no, no, no. That wasn't— that wasn't my Chinese food, was it?

[panicked]
I threw away her, um, her lunch! Her good lunch that she was probably, uh, probably saving for today! [groan] What kind of person just— just throws away someone else's food without asking?

[spiraling]
Oh my god, I'm a— I'm a monster! I'm the, uh, the worst roommate ever! She trusted me and I just— [defeated whimper] I just violated the sacred fridge code! What if she, um, what if she never forgives me for this?

597 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 8ac97fc5

SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly recounting a shortcut they took driving, then remembering a camera they passed, then wondering if they ran a red light, ending in ticket anxiety
==================================================

[casual]
So I took that back route through downtown today, you know the one that cuts behind the mall? Saved me like ten minutes, which was great because I was already running late for my appointment.

[matter-of-fact]
There was this one intersection where I had to gun it a little bit because the light was changing, but whatever, that happens. Traffic was moving, I was moving with it.

[slight concern]
Actually, now that I think about it... [pause] there was this camera thing at that intersection. One of those big flash camera setups? I remember seeing it as I went through.

[a bit worried]
Wait, was that light yellow or red when I went under it? I mean, I thought it was yellow, but I was focused on the car in front of me, and— [nervous laugh] oh god, what if it was red?

[increasingly anxious]
Those cameras are like, super sensitive, right? They'll ticket you for being in the intersection even if you're just— [sharp exhale] I can't afford a red light ticket right now. Those are like three hundred dollars!

[spiraling] [panicked]
Oh my god, what if there's already a ticket in the mail? What if it's sitting in my mailbox right now? [groan] I'm never taking shortcuts again. Never! Why did I think— [whimper] I'm gonna be checking my mail obsessively for the next two weeks!

598 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: be34c05b

SCENARIO: Annoyed their train is packed, then a seat opens up right next to them
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, the train this morning was just— it was a nightmare. Like absolutely packed, people pressed up against each other, and I'm just standing there getting elbowed by this guy with his giant backpack who clearly has no spatial awareness whatsoever.

[annoyed] [groan]
And you know how I get when I'm squished in with all those people, I just— I can't breathe, everyone's breathing on each other, it's gross. I was literally counting the stops like, okay, just four more, just three more...

[irritated]
Plus this woman kept pushing past people to get closer to the door even though we weren't even near her stop yet? Like lady, we're all trapped in here together, just— just wait your turn.

[surprised]
But then— okay, this is weird— right as I'm having this whole internal meltdown about personal space, the seat right next to me just opens up. Like the universe heard me complaining.

[softer] [half laugh]
And I just... I sat down and suddenly everything felt manageable again. Like I could actually think, I wasn't focused on just surviving the ride anymore.

[thoughtful]
It's funny how something that small can completely change your whole— your whole mood, you know? One minute I'm ready to push people, next minute I'm like, oh, okay, this is fine actually.

[warm] [small laugh]
Made me realize I was probably being way too dramatic about the whole thing.
