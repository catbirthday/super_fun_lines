Script: 555fd843_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I don't really want to talk about it.
677 Character 2: [speaking slowly] That's okay. We don't have to talk about anything specific. We can just... be here for a bit. What's going on right now?
Character 1: Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine.
678 Character 2: [pause] You're not fine. And that's—that's not a judgment. You just don't seem fine. Your shoulders are tense, you're not making eye contact, and you said you didn't want to talk about it before I even asked what it was.
Character 1: [angry] See, this is why I didn't want to come. You people are always reading into things.
679 Character 2: You're right, I am reading into things. That's kind of my job. But like, I'm not trying to trap you or prove you wrong. I'm just noticing what I'm seeing. [pause] And if I'm off base, you can tell me.
Character 1: You're not off base. I'm just—I don't want to talk about her. Okay?
680 Character 2: Okay. We won't talk about her. [pause] But like, she's the thing you don't want to talk about, so—[pause]—maybe that's where we need to start.
Character 1: [voice breaking] No. I'm done talking about it. I've said everything there is to say.
681 Character 2: [gently] Have you? Because it sounds like there's still a lot of feeling there. And like, you don't have to let it out right now if you're not ready. But—[pause]—the fact that you're not ready is information too.
Character 1: [getting quiet] I keep thinking she's going to text me. Like, I'll be doing something normal and I'll think "oh, I should tell her about this" and then I remember and it's like... it's like finding out all over again.
682 Character 2: [pause] That sounds exhausting. Like, your brain hasn't caught up with the reality yet.
Character 1: My brain is fine. It's my stupid heart that won't accept it.
683 Character 2: [pause] I don't think that's stupid. I think that's just grief. Your mind knows she's gone, but your body, your habits, your whole nervous system is still wired for her being here. That takes time to rewire.
Character 1: [sobbing] How much time? Because I can't keep doing this. I can't keep reaching for my phone to call her.
684 Character 2: [speaking slowly] There's no timeline for this. And like, I know that's frustrating because you probably want an answer. But grief isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others. Some days you'll forget for five minutes and then remember and it'll hit you all over again.
Character 1: [angry again] That sounds horrible.
685 Character 2: It is. It really is. [pause] But like, the fact that you're grieving this hard—that means she mattered. That means the relationship was real and deep and important. [pause] And that's actually not nothing.
Character 1: [chuckle, but sad] She would hate that I'm here. She always said therapy was for people who couldn't handle their own problems.
686 Character 2: [pause] Well, she's not here anymore. So maybe this is something you get to decide for yourself now. [pause] And like, I think she'd want you to be okay. Even if she wouldn't admit it.
Character 1: Dude are you seriously not ready yet?
687 Character 2: [Very fast] I'm ready, I'm ready — I just — I can't find my other shoe, okay? It was right here like — like ten minutes ago.
Character 1: We're gonna be late.
688 Character 2: [Very loud] I know we're gonna be late! You think I don't — [chuckle] okay wait, found it. It was under the — why was it under the couch? Whatever. Okay. Let's go, let's go.
Character 1: You got the tickets?
689 Character 2: [Whisper] Oh no. [Very loud] I'm kidding! [Chuckle] Your face though. Yes I have the tickets, they're — they're on my phone. Section 114, row 8, seats — uh — 12 and 13.
Character 1: Don't do that to me man.
690 Character 2: [Chuckle] Sorry, sorry. I couldn't resist. [Happy] But dude — section 114! That's like — that's right behind the bench basically. I can't believe you got these.
Character 1: My cousin came through.
691 Character 2: [Very loud] Your cousin's a legend! A literal — [chuckle] okay we actually have to leave now. Doors open at 6 and it's already — wait what time is it?
Character 1: 5:20.
692 Character 2: [Very angry] 5:20?! Why didn't you — okay no that's on me. That's on me. [Very fast] Okay shoes on, wallet, keys, phone — do I need a jacket? Is it gonna be cold? What's the — what's the weather doing?
Character 1: It's fine, you don't need a jacket.
693 Character 2: [Whisper] Okay. Okay okay okay. [Cheerful] We're doing this! Game night! [Chuckle] Sorry I'm being weird, I've just been looking forward to this all — all week honestly. Work has been so — ugh.
Character 1: Yeah you mentioned. The spreadsheet thing?
694 Character 2: [Very angry] The spreadsheet thing! Dude — 47 pages. 47. And Marcus just kept — kept adding columns like it was nothing. Like we don't have to actually read this stuff. [Chuckle] But whatever, that's — that's not tonight's vibe. Tonight we watch large men skate fast and hit each other.
Character 1: That's the spirit.
695 Character 2: [Happy] Right? [Very fast] Oh! We should stop and get food first because stadium nachos are like — eleven dollars for like seven chips and I'm not doing that again. There's that taco place on 5th that's — it's right on the way.
Character 1: The one with the green salsa?
696 Character 2: [Very loud] Yes! The green salsa place! [Cheerful] Okay see, this is — this is gonna be a good night. I can feel it. Tacos, hockey, no spreadsheets — [whisper] no Marcus — [chuckle] let's get out of here.

697 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: dd183463

SCENARIO: discovering the banana they packed got smushed
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so, um, lunch time, let me just— let me see what I've got in here. Sandwich, check, um, apple, and then I packed a banana because I was being all, uh, all healthy this morning, and—

[slightly dismayed]
Oh. Oh no. What is— what is this? This is, um, this is not a banana anymore. This is like, uh, like banana soup in a peel. [tsk] Great. Just— just great.

[thinking out loud]
I mean, I should've— I should've known this would happen, right? Like, bananas are basically designed to, um, to self-destruct the moment you look at them wrong. And I just threw it in here with my, uh, my heavy textbook and—

[resigned but rambling]
Maybe I can still— no, no, that's gross. That's definitely gross. I'm not eating banana mush. Although, I mean, technically it's the same banana, it's just, um, it's just differently shaped now? Like, really differently shaped.

[trailing off]
I guess I could get something from the vending machine, but that's like three dollars for a, uh, for a stale granola bar, which is... [sigh] I should really start packing more durable fruit.

698 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 69e0ecb0

SCENARIO: debating whether to eat lunch now or wait until they're hungrier
==================================================

[muttering to self]
Okay, so it's, um, it's twelve-thirty, and I'm like— I'm kind of hungry? But not, uh, not really hungry hungry, you know? Like, I could eat, but I could also— I could also just wait.

[contemplative]
The thing is, if I eat now, I'm gonna be, um, I'm gonna be hungry again at like three or something, and that's— that's weird timing for dinner, right? But if I wait, then I'm just gonna get, uh, get hangry and probably eat something stupid.

[slightly whiny]
I mean, I had breakfast at like eight, so that's— [hmm] that's four and a half hours, which is, um, which is pretty normal? I think? God, when did eating become so, uh, so complicated.

[more decisive]
Okay, but here's the thing— here's the thing, if I'm thinking about it, then I'm probably hungry enough, right? Like, if I wasn't hungry, I wouldn't be having this whole, um, this whole internal debate about—

[trailing off, resigned]
You know what? I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna make the sandwich. This is ridiculous. I'm a grown person having a, uh, having a full conversation with myself about lunch timing. [laugh] Cool. Very normal.

--- CONVERSATION ---
Character 1: I don't know why I called.
699 Character 2: That's okay. You don't, you don't need a reason really. I'm here. So. What's going on?
Character 1: Everything's just... a lot right now.
700 Character 2: [speaking slowly] Yeah. I hear that. A lot can mean, I mean, it can mean different things. Is it one big thing or more like, like everything piling up at once?
Character 1: The piling thing.
701 Character 2: Mm. That's hard. When it's one thing you can, you can point at it, you know? But the pile is just... it's heavy and you can't even explain why. Does anyone know you're struggling?
Character 1: Not really. I don't want to burden people.
702 Character 2: [softly] That's, that's a very common thing to feel. But can I say something? And you can disagree. The people who love you, they'd probably want to know. The burden thing, it's... it's something we tell ourselves but it's not usually true.
Character 1: What if they can't handle it?
703 Character 2: Then you find out, I guess. And that's information too. But most of the time people surprise us. They're, they're stronger than we give them credit for. [chuckle] Sorry, that sounded like a fortune cookie.
Character 1: A little bit.
704 Character 2: Yeah, I know. I'm just, I'm trying to say you don't have to do this alone. Whatever "this" is. You called, right? That's something. That's, that's you reaching out even if it doesn't feel like it.
Character 1: I almost didn't.
705 Character 2: [speaking slowly] But you did. That matters. The almost doesn't, doesn't cancel out the did. You're here now.
Character 1: [sad] I'm just so tired.
706 Character 2: I know. I can, I can hear it. The tired that sleep doesn't fix, right? That's a different kind of tired. It's okay to feel that. It doesn't mean you're broken or, or weak. It just means you've been carrying too much for too long.
Character 1: [sobbing] I don't remember when it started.
707 Character 2: [softly] Hey. It's okay. You don't need to know when it started to, to start feeling better. That's not how it works. You just, you start where you are. Which is here. On the phone. With me. That's enough for right now.
Character 1: I'm sorry for crying.
708 Character 2: Don't be. Please. [getting happy] Actually, crying is, it's good. It means something is moving instead of staying stuck. You're not broken. You're just, you're human and you're hurting and you reached out. That took courage. Real courage. Okay? I'm glad you called.
Character 1: You can't just decide that for me. That's not how this works.
709 Character 2: [quickly] I'm not deciding anything. I'm just saying—from my perspective, from what I'm seeing—you're making a mistake and I can't watch you do it without saying something.
Character 1: Well, don't. [pause] You don't get to be the voice of reason here.
710 Character 2: [speaking slowly] Why... because I'm the one who cares enough to say the hard thing? Because everyone else is just nodding along and I'm the only one willing to actually—
Character 1: You're not the only one. You're just the loudest.
711 Character 2: [chuckle, but not in a nice way] Okay, fair. Yeah, I am loud. But like, someone has to be, because you're not listening to yourself right now.
Character 1: I'm listening to myself just fine, thanks.
712 Character 2: [angry] No, you're not. You're listening to what you think you should want, not what you actually want. And there's a difference.
Character 1: [pause] How would you even know what I actually want?
713 Character 2: [getting happy, almost laughing] Because I pay attention? Because I've watched you light up when you talk about the thing you said you didn't care about anymore? Because you're a terrible liar and your face does this thing where—[catches self]—never mind.
Character 1: Where what?
714 Character 2: [speaking slowly, softer] Where you look scared. Like you're about to say something real and then you pull back.
Character 1: I'm not scared.
715 Character 2: [sad] Yeah, you are. And that's fine. But don't pretend you're not.
Character 1: [pause] You don't get to tell me how I feel.
716 Character 2: [quickly] I'm not telling you how you feel. I'm telling you what I see. And what I see is someone who's about to make a choice they're going to regret because they're afraid of something.
Character 1: [sobbing slightly] Maybe I like being afraid, okay? Maybe that's safer than—than being vulnerable or whatever the hell you're asking me to be.
717 Character 2: [pause, speaking slowly] Then be afraid. Be afraid and do it anyway. [pause] That's kind of what brave is, isn't it?
Character 1: [quiet] I don't know how to do that.
718 Character 2: [chuckle, warm this time] Yeah, you do. You just did it. You admitted you're scared. That's the hardest part.

Character A: [hesitant] Okay sweetie, so I just press this button and— [sharp gasp] Oh God, everything disappeared! [panicking] The screen went black, did I break it? Where did all those little squares go? I knew this was a bad idea!
719 Character B: [exasperated sigh] Mom, you literally just locked the screen. [slower, patronizing] Press. The. Same. Button. Again. [irritated] See? Everything's still there, nothing exploded, the world didn't end, your apps are perfectly fine.
Character A: [relieved giggle] Oh thank goodness! [confused] But why do they call them apps anyway? [thoughtfully slower] In my day, applications were something you filled out at the bank. These tiny pictures don't look like paperwork at all.
720 Character B: [through gritted teeth] It's just short for application, Mom. [speeding up] Now can we please move on to setting up your email before I lose my mind? [deep breath] We've been on this for twenty minutes already.
Character A: [defensively] Well excuse me for being careful! [worried whisper] Your father's friend Harold clicked something wrong once and [dramatically louder] hackers stole his entire identity! They bought boats in his name! Multiple boats!
721 Character B: [flat tone] Harold downloaded sketchy casino apps, Mom. [snorting laugh] That's completely different. [firmly] Just follow exactly what I say and you'll be fine. Now tap the little envelope icon at the bottom of your screen.
Character A: [uncertainly] The envelope? [increasingly frantic] I see three envelope thingies! There's a blue one, a green one that's making a dinging noise, and— [triumphant] Oh wait, that last one's a shopping bag. Never mind!
722 Character B: [barely contained frustration] The BLUE one, Mom. [sarcastically sweet] The one that literally says 'Mail' underneath it. [muttering] How did you manage to raise three kids but can't identify basic icons? This is painful.
Character A: [hurt] I identified plenty of things before computers took over the world! [proudly] I can still balance a checkbook by hand. [mumbling] Unlike your generation who can't even write in cursive or read an analog clock properly.
723 Character B: [defensive shout] We can read analog clocks! [quieter, resigned] Whatever, just type your email address where it says 'Email Address.' [weary sigh] And please don't ask me what email address means. You've had the same one for ten years.
Character A: [typing sounds verbally] R... O... S... E... [confused pause] Wait, do I need the little circle thingy? [anxious] And should I capitalize anything? The computer at the library always yells at me about capitals and symbols!
724 Character B: [loud groan] The @ symbol, yes, you need it! [speaking rapidly] It's rosemary-underscore-smith@gmail.com, all lowercase, [desperate] exactly like it's written on the sticky note you've carried in your purse since 2014! Remember?
Character A: [thoughtful humming] Oh right, the sticky note! [rustling verbally] Let me just— [victorious] Found it! Though I don't understand why email addresses can't have spaces. [plaintively] Seems unnecessarily complicated if you ask me.
725 Character B: [exhausted whisper] Nobody asked you. [regular volume, mechanical] Now type your password. [suddenly alert] And no, don't say it out loud! [hushed urgency] Just type it. Other people exist in this coffee shop, Mother.
Character A: [whispering loudly] But how will I remember what I typed? [concerned] What if I make a typo? [getting louder] Last time I got locked out for three months because I accidentally held down the shift key!
726 Character B: [defeated tone] There's literally a "show password" option. [tired laugh] See the little eye icon? [pleading] Just tap it and you can see what you're typing. We're so close to done, please don't give up now.
Character A: [amazed gasp] The eye shows the password! [delighted] That's actually quite clever! [suspicious] Though isn't it creepy that phones have eyes now? [nervously] Is it watching me all the time? Should I put tape over it?
727 Character B: [hysterical laughter] No Mom, it's not a real eye! [catching breath] It's just a symbol! [more calmly] Like how a trash can icon doesn't mean there's actual garbage in your phone. These are metaphors!
Character A: [proudly] Well, I did it! [excited squeal] Look, there's already an email from someone! [reading slowly] "Nigerian prince needs your urgent help..." [hopeful] Oh how nice, royalty! Should I help him, dear?
728 Character B: [screaming] NO! [frantic] Delete it immediately! [rapid fire] Don't open it, don't reply, don't even look at it! [exhausted groan] You know what? I'm installing parental controls. This is for your own good.

Script: 22118b4e | Role: Customer Support

729 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Good afternoon, Riverside Labs, this is Sandra speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today?
Customer: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my blood work from last week—it's been seven days and [sighs heavily] nobody's called me back. The doctor said it would be, um, three days maximum.
730 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh, I understand your frustration. [typing quickly] Let me pull up your file right away—could you provide your last name and date of birth please?
Customer: [impatiently] It's Morrison, M-O-R-R-I-S-O-N, birthday is April fifteenth. [more urgently] Look, I really need these results because my surgery is scheduled for next week.
731 Customer Support: [concerned] Okay Mr. Morrison, I see your file here and—[pause] hmm, that's strange. [more quietly] It shows the samples were processed but the results are still pending review.
Customer: [exasperated] Pending review? What does that even mean? [louder] I've been waiting by the phone, missing work meetings because I thought someone would call!
732 Customer Support: [quickly] I completely understand, and I'm so sorry about this delay. [more reassuringly] Let me contact the lab supervisor right now to see what's holding things up—can you hold for just a moment?
Customer: [sighs] Fine, but I've already been on hold twice today for twenty minutes each time. [sarcastically] Third time's the charm, right?
733 Customer Support: [briskly] Actually, you know what? Stay on the line—I'll conference call the lab directly. [determinedly] We're going to sort this out right now, no more waiting.
Customer: [surprised] Oh, well that's... that's actually helpful. [more calmly] Thank you for taking this seriously, I've been really stressed about this whole situation.
734 Customer Support: [professionally] Alright, I've got Dr. Kim from the lab on the line now. [quickly] She says there was a labeling issue with one vial, but—good news—they can expedite the remaining results.
Customer: [relieved] Oh thank God! [anxiously] So when exactly will I get them? I need to send everything to my surgeon by Thursday at the latest.
735 Customer Support: [confidently] Dr. Kim guarantees you'll have them by tomorrow afternoon, two PM at the absolute latest. [more firmly] I'm also putting a priority flag on your file.
Customer: [skeptically] You're sure about this? Because last time someone guaranteed me three days and [pause] well, here we are having this conversation.
736 Customer Support: [reassuringly] I understand your concern completely. [quickly] I'm giving you my direct extension—474—and I'll personally follow up with you tomorrow morning, around ten.
Customer: [gradually calming] Okay, that... that actually makes me feel better. [sighs] Sorry if I was a bit harsh earlier, it's just been such a stressful week.
737 Customer Support: [warmly] No apology necessary at all—medical delays are incredibly frustrating. [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you on the line?
Customer: [thoughtfully] Actually, yes—can you email me a confirmation of what we just discussed? [more firmly] I want documentation this time, just in case something goes wrong again.
738 Customer Support: [efficiently] Absolutely, I'm typing that up right now. [quickly] You'll have it in your inbox within five minutes, with my contact info and Dr. Kim's notes about the expedited processing.
Customer: [gratefully] Thank you, Sandra, you've been really helpful. [lighter tone] Guess I won't need to switch labs after all—though I was definitely considering it this morning!

739 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is Marcus with Premier Lending, license number M-L-O-3-3-9-7-2. How can I help you with your mortgage needs today?
Customer: Hi, um, I'm—I'm looking at buying my first home and I keep hearing about rates going up and down, and honestly I don't even know where to start with all this.
740 Customer Support: No problem, I work with first-time buyers every day. Let me pull up today's rates—can I get your zip code to check what's available in your area?
Customer: Yeah, it's 9-8-1-0-4, and actually, wait—should I be pre-approved first or should I be looking at rates? I'm kind of doing this backwards, aren't I?
741 Customer Support: You're fine—knowing rates helps you understand your budget. For that zip, I'm seeing thirty-year fixed at 7.125% with APR 7.342%, loan number prefix F-H-A-3-0.
Customer: Okay so that seven point—sorry, what was that again? And also, like, what's the difference between the rate and that APR thing you mentioned?
742 Customer Support: Rate's 7.125%, that's your interest; APR includes all fees, so 7.342%. For pre-approval, I'll need to run application number A-P-P-2-4-6-8-1—takes about twenty minutes.
Customer: Twenty minutes, that's—that's actually pretty quick. But I've been reading about points, and buying down rates? Someone told me about discount code D-I-S-C-9-9, is that even a real thing?
743 Customer Support: That's not a discount code—points are prepaid interest. One point costs one percent of your loan, typically drops your rate by 0.25%, reference chart R-C-4-4-7.
Customer: So if I'm looking at, say, a three hundred thousand dollar loan—God, that number still sounds crazy—one point would be three thousand dollars upfront?
744 Customer Support: Exactly right, three thousand upfront to lower your monthly payment. Let me calculate your savings—what's your email for quote number Q-U-O-T-E-8-8-5-1?
Customer: It's, um, firsttimebuyer at—actually no, use my other one—j dot smith 22 at gmail dot com, all lowercase.
745 Customer Support: Perfect, sending to j.smith22 at gmail. Your confirmation is C-N-F-7-7-2-9-4—should arrive in thirty seconds with three scenarios.
Customer: Okay I just—yeah, I got it. So scenario B with case number C-A-S-E-5-5-3 looks interesting, but why is the closing cost so different from scenario A?
746 Customer Support: Scenario B includes 1.5 points, that's forty-five hundred dollars, dropping your rate to 6.875%. Your break-even is month thirty-two, tracking number T-R-K-4-4-1.
Customer: Month thirty-two means—so like almost three years before I actually save money? What if rates drop next year and everyone's refinancing again?
747 Customer Support: Valid concern—refinance typically costs three to five thousand. If rates drop below 6.5%, you'd refinance regardless, making points less attractive—see addendum A-D-D-2-2-9.
Customer: This is actually making more sense now than I thought it would. Can we—should we start that pre-approval today, or should I think about it over the weekend?
748 Customer Support: I'd start today—rates locked for sixty days with application P-R-E-9-9-3-3-1. No obligation, just gives you negotiating power when you find your house.
Customer: You know what, yeah, let's—let's do it. I mean, I've been putting this off for months already, might as well just jump in, right?
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

749 [Sad] I couldn't keep pretending everything was fine when I was, like, eating ramen for the third week straight. [Sigh] [Happy] You know what's funny?

[Groan] [Fast] Wait wait wait, before you judge me, let me explain—there's actually a really good reason for this.

[Sad] [Sigh] [Angry] This is so—no, you know what, forget being mad, I'm gonna channel this into something productive! [Fast] [Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, like, kidding myself here, but then I remember how far I've already come. [Chuckle] [Happy] [Shout] Tomorrow's a brand new day with brand new opportunities! [Disappointed] I mean, I kinda expected this one to be different, but, um, here we are again, I guess. [Slow] [Tsk] [Fast] [Laugh] My mom keeps saying persistence pays off and honestly she's—she's usually right about these things, so I'm gonna keep going! [Sarcastic] [Groan] Sure, why not make it an even twenty rejections, I'm basically a professional at this point. [Sad] It's just that I really thought—never mind, dwelling on it won't, er, won't change anything. [Whisper] [Happy] Listen, Thomas Edison failed like a thousand times before the light bulb, so I'm basically on track! [Fast] [Chuckle] [Angry] [Slow] I am so tired of hearing "we've decided to go in a different direction" that I could just—actually, no, breathe. [Disappointed] [Sigh] Another one down, but, um, at least I'm getting really good at handling disappointment, right? [Shout] You know what, their loss! [Happy] [Laugh] Seriously, they're gonna regret this someday! [Whisper] [Sad] I keep a folder of all the rejections and sometimes I look at them and think—maybe I should just... [Fast] Okay so basically what I've learned is that rejection is, like, part of the process and I gotta embrace it or whatever. [Tsk] [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] I should get a punch card—ten rejections and the eleventh one's free, y'know? [Slow] [Happy] Every single person who's successful has been where I am right now, so, um, I guess I'm in good company. [Angry] Why do they always—wait, no, getting worked up isn't gonna help anything. [Sigh] [Disappointed] I just gotta keep swimming, I suppose.--- MONOLOGUE ---

SCENARIO: Frustrated about a parking garage, then remembers they parked on a different level
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, don't even get me started on this stupid parking garage. I was walking around for like twenty minutes looking for my car, just— just wandering around like an idiot pressing the little button on my keys hoping to hear something beep.

[annoyed]
And of course it's like ninety degrees in there because their ventilation is garbage, so I'm sweating and getting more and more pissed off. I'm thinking maybe someone stole it? Like who steals a 2018 Honda Civic but, I don't know, maybe they do.

[increasingly agitated]
So I'm about to call the police, right? I've got my phone out and I'm like rehearsing what I'm gonna say— "Hi, um, I think my car got stolen from the Third Street garage," and I feel like such an idiot because who loses their car, you know?

[embarrassed realization]
But then I'm looking at my parking ticket and I— oh. Oh no. [nervous laugh] I'm on level two. My ticket says level four.

[sheepish] [slightly amused]
I parked on level four. I've been wandering around level two this entire time like a complete moron. Twenty minutes! In the wrong— in the completely wrong section of the garage.

[laughing at self]
So yeah, that's— that's how my day's going. I'm apparently losing my mind. [chuckle] At least my car wasn't actually stolen, so there's that.

SCENARIO: Casually describing a spot they've been scratching, then looking at it, then seeing it's become a wound from scratching, ending in self-inflicted skin damage guilt
==================================================

[casual]
Oh, yeah, so I've been, um, I've been scratching this spot on my arm all day. You know how it is when you get like, uh, like a mosquito bite or something? It's just been, um, really itchy.

[matter-of-fact]
I think it started yesterday, actually. Just this little, uh, this little bump thing on my forearm. But I kept, um, I kept going at it without really thinking, you know? [light laugh] Like when you're watching TV or whatever.

[slightly concerned]
Actually, let me— let me just check how it's, uh, how it's looking now because it's been bothering me all morning and I— [pause] Oh. Oh wow, that's, um...

[worried]
That's— that's not good. That's not, uh, that's not a mosquito bite anymore. There's like, um, there's actually blood? And it's all, uh, it's all raw looking now. [nervous laugh] I really— I really went at this thing.

[guilt building]
God, I can't— I can't believe I did this to myself. I just, um, I just kept scratching and scratching without even— without even looking at what I was doing. It's like, uh, it's like I was on autopilot or something.

[spiraling with shame]
This is so stupid. I'm, um, I'm twenty-eight years old and I can't— I can't stop myself from scratching a— a bug bite until it's, uh, until it's bleeding? [groan] What is wrong with me? I literally— I literally damaged my own skin because I have no self-control!

SCENARIO: Excited about a promotion, then second-guesses if they can handle it, then gets an encouraging text from their mentor
==================================================

[excited]
Oh my God, I had to call you immediately! I got it— I got the promotion! They just told me like twenty minutes ago and I'm still like, I can't even— [nervous laugh] I'm literally shaking right now.

[thrilled] [breathless]
It's the senior manager position, the one I've been like wanting forever, and apparently they were really impressed with that client presentation I did last month. The one where I was like sweating bullets the whole time? [laugh] That one!

[excitement fading] [uncertain]
But now I'm like— I mean, it's amazing, don't get me wrong, but I'm starting to think about what this actually means and I'm like... do I actually know what I'm doing? Like, I'll have people reporting to me now and I've never— I don't know how to manage people.

[worried]
What if I'm terrible at it? What if they realize they made a mistake and I'm just like, I don't know, winging it the whole time? God, what if I let everyone down?

[surprised] [softer]
Oh wait, hold on, my mentor Sarah is— she's texting me. Um... she says "Heard the amazing news! You've earned this completely. Trust yourself - you're going to be incredible." With like three heart emojis.

[emotional] [grateful]
That's... wow. She always knows exactly when I need to hear something like that. [small laugh] Okay, yeah. I can do this. I can totally do this.
