SCENARIO: a man named Trevor gets the keys to his first apartment
==================================================

[excited but trying to stay cool]
Okay, so, um— so this is it. This is actually happening. I have, uh, I have keys. To my own place. [nervous laugh] Trevor's got keys, like, actual keys that open an actual door to an actual apartment that's, um, that's mine now.

[muttering, working through it]
I should probably, uh, I should probably go in, right? Like, that's— that's what you do when you have keys. You use them. But it's just, um, it's weird because I've been waiting for this for so long and now it's like— now it's real and I'm just standing here talking to myself in the hallway like a—

[slightly bewildered]
Wait, do I knock first? [snort] That's stupid, Trevor, it's your place now. You don't— you don't knock on your own door. Although, I mean, it doesn't feel like my door yet, you know? It feels like I'm about to break into someone else's—

[more confident]
Okay, okay, let me just— [exhale] deep breath. Insert key, turn key, open door. It's not, um, it's not rocket science. Just basic, uh, basic human functioning here.

[quieter, almost reverent]
Holy shit. I'm about to walk into my own apartment. My own space. No roommates, no parents, just... just me and whatever furniture I can afford. [laugh] Which is, uh, which is probably just a mattress on the floor for a while, but still.

SCENARIO: an archaeologist in a buried temple, attempting to read the ancient map but it's upside down
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so this is definitely a map, that's— that's good. Ancient Sumerian, I think? The symbols look right, but why does everything seem backwards? The river should be flowing toward the mountains, not away from them.

[frustrated]
Wait a minute. Wait wait wait. [exhale] Am I holding this thing upside down? That would be— oh, that would be so typical. Thirty years of fieldwork and I'm reading a map like a tourist.

[sheepish]
Right, so if I just— [grunt] flip this around, then the temple entrance should be... there. Not there. Which means I've been crawling through the wrong passage for the last two hours. Great.

[increasingly anxious]
Okay, but that also means the flood chamber is actually behind me, not ahead, which is— that's actually worse? Because if the water rises, I'm trapped between— [gulp] No, no, focus. Follow the map.

[resigned]
The correct map. Right-side up. Like a professional. [sigh] Sometimes I really hate this job.

SCENARIO: an immigrant named Fatima passes her U.S. citizenship test
==================================================

[breathless, excited]
Oh my god, oh my god, I— I actually did it. I actually, um, I actually passed. [laugh] Okay, okay, breathe, Fatima. You're— you're officially gonna be American. That's so— that's so weird to say out loud.

[muttering, processing]
Eighteen questions. I got, um, I got eighteen out of twenty right, which is— that's more than enough, right? You only need, uh, you only need twelve. But still, I kept thinking about those two I got wrong. The, um, the one about the— what was it? The judicial branch something.

[slightly anxious, talking faster]
And now I have to wait for the ceremony date, and then I need to, uh— oh god, I need to tell mama. She's gonna cry. She's definitely gonna cry. [sigh] In a good way, but still. And Ahmed, he's gonna be like "I told you so" because he kept saying I was overstudying.

[wondering, trailing off]
I mean, I guess I was overstudying. All those flashcards, and the, um, the practice tests online. But I just wanted to be— I wanted to be really sure, you know? This is, uh, this is kind of a big deal.

[quietly amazed]
American citizen. Fatima, American citizen. [laugh] That sounds... that sounds pretty good, actually.

SCENARIO: a woman named Hannah sees the positive pregnancy test after years of trying
==================================================

[whispered, disbelieving]
Okay, so, um— is that— is that actually two lines? Like, I'm not, uh, I'm not seeing things, right? Because I've been, um, I've been staring at these stupid tests for, like, three years now and it's always just the one line, always just—

[faster, slightly breathless]
Wait wait wait. Let me just— [exhale] let me just read the box again because sometimes the, uh, the cheap ones are weird about— okay, two lines means pregnant, one line means not pregnant. That's— that's pretty straightforward, right?

[cautious hope creeping in]
But it's like, it's like a really faint second line? Is faint still— I mean, faint still counts, right? It's not like, um, it's not like half-pregnant or something. [nervous laugh] That's not— that's not a thing.

[muttering, processing]
I should probably, uh, I should probably take another one. Just to be— just to be sure. Because what if this one's defective or— or what if I'm just really, really wanting to see—

[quieter, almost afraid to say it]
Oh my god. Oh my god, what if it's actually— what if we actually—

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 51cd7c88 | Role: Character B

Character A: [Shrieking] OH MY GOD, IS THAT—IS THAT REALLY YOU?! [getting louder] I can't believe it's actually happening! [Sobbing laugh] Come here, come here right now! These three years felt like thirty without you!
1049 Character B: [High pitched squeal] SHUT UP, SHUT UP, I'M DYING! [trembling] My legs are literally shaking—I might collapse! [Gasping breath] You look exactly the same but different somehow. How is your hair even more perfect than I remembered?
Character A: [through tears] Don't you dare make me cry harder! [Sniffling] My mascara cost forty dollars and it's supposedly waterproof. [more shakily] God, I practiced being cool for this moment, but seeing your face just destroyed every ounce of composure.
1050 Character B: [whispered disbelief] This feels like a dream I've had a hundred times. [building excitement] Wait, let me touch you to make sure you're real! [Cackling] Remember when we promised we'd never go this long without seeing each other?
Character A: [defensive and fast] That wasn't my fault—you moved to Singapore! [softer] Though I guess I could've visited sooner instead of just stalking your Instagram stories every single night. [Nervous giggle] Did you see all my desperate comments?
1051 Character B: [warmly] Every single one made my day brighter, you absolute angel. [getting emotional] Some nights, reading them was the only thing that kept me going. [Shaky exhale] The time difference made everything so much harder than we expected.
Character A: [frantically] We have so much to catch up on—where do we even start? [Breathless] Your mom told me about the promotion, the breakup, the new apartment! [more quietly] But I need to hear everything directly from you, every single detail.
1052 Character B: [exhausted tone] The breakup was actually the best thing that happened. [brightening] It led to therapy, which led to clarity, which led to... [mysterious whisper] meeting someone new. Someone I think you're going to absolutely adore.
Character A: [accusatory] EXCUSE ME, there's someone new and I'm just hearing about this NOW?! [hurt] We used to text about every first date within five minutes! [Pleading] Please tell me you at least have photos on your phone to show me.
1053 Character B: [guilty mumbling] I wanted to tell you in person because... [pause] [explosive] WE'RE ENGAGED! [Squealing] She proposed last month at sunset on the beach where we had our first kiss! Can you believe it's actually happening?!
Character A: [stunned silence] [then screaming] WHAT?! ENGAGED?! [choking up] Oh my god, I'm so happy I could throw up! You're getting married and I get to be there this time! When? Where? Tell me absolutely everything immediately!
1054 Character B: [giddy] Next spring in Barcelona—you know I always dreamed of that! [tenderly] And obviously, I can't do it without my best friend there. [more seriously] Actually, I need to ask you something really important about the wedding.
Character A: [suspiciously] If you're about to ask me to wear some hideous bridesmaid dress, I swear... [Laughing] Just kidding, I'd wear a garbage bag for you! [emotionally] Being there for your big day means everything to me, you know that, right?
1055 Character B: [nervously] Actually, I don't want you as a bridesmaid. [quick and excited] I want you as my maid of honor! [Crying] Nobody else could possibly stand next to me on the most important day of my entire life!
Character A: [Wailing] Stop it, STOP IT, you're killing me with happiness! [through sobs] Of course, yes, a thousand times yes! [more composed] I promise I'll give the most embarrassing speech about all our teenage disasters and make everyone cry!
1056 Character B: [nostalgic] Remember when we planned our weddings at fifteen? [Giggling] We were going to marry twins and live next door! [wistfully] Life took us different directions, but somehow the important parts of our dreams are still coming true.
Character A: [philosophically] Funny how we thought geography could change us. [firmly] But here we are, crying in an airport like no time passed at all. [Soft laugh] My therapist is going to love hearing about this ridiculous public meltdown.
1057 Character B: [dramatically] Speaking of meltdowns, wait until you hear about my work disaster last month! [lowering voice] I accidentally sent a very personal email to the entire company. [Groaning] Three hundred people now know way too much about my digestive issues.
Character A: [Explosive laughter] That is SO perfectly you! [sympathetically] Though honestly, mine was worse—I called my boss "babe" in a meeting. [cringing] Then tried to cover by calling everyone babe. [defeated] Nobody bought it. I'm still mortified.
1058 Character B: [lovingly] God, I missed this—missed YOU—so much it physically hurt sometimes. [determined] Promise me we'll never let this happen again, no matter what. [quietly fierce] Life's too short and we're too important to each other for any more long goodbyes.

Script: 0c53a90e | Role: Character B

Character A: [pompously] Welcome to my humble abode! [chuckle] Four bedrooms, three baths, and [getting louder] a kitchen that would make Gordon Ramsay weep. Did I mention the heated floors? [smugly] My toes haven't been cold since Tuesday.
1059 Character B: [flatly] Wow, heated floors. [quieter] Meanwhile, my radiator sounds like it's dying. [Bitter laugh] But hey, at least my landlord fixed the leak last month—only took him three weeks and four angry voicemails.
Character A: [in a sing-song voice] Oh, speaking of landlords, [triumphantly] I don't have one anymore! [Deep satisfied sigh] Just me, myself, and my mortgage. Want to see the master suite? [excitedly] The walk-in closet is bigger than your entire bedroom.
1060 Character B: [sarcastically] How delightful for you. [Dry chuckle] I share my closet with the water heater. [more bitterly] Sometimes at night, it gurgles like it's mocking me. [slower] "You'll never escape," it says.
Character A: [dismissively] You're so dramatic! [Hearty laugh] Look at this view though—[in awe] mountains, trees, not a single neighbor in sight. [bragging] The previous owners practically begged me to take it off their hands.
1061 Character B: [tiredly] My view is spectacular too. [Snort] A brick wall and Mrs. Henderson's underwear drying on her fire escape. [getting angrier] She uses the same clothesline for her cat's toys. [disgusted] The aesthetic is truly unmatched.
Character A: [condescendingly] You should really consider buying. [faster] The market's only going up, up, up! [Gleeful cackle] My equity has already increased by fifteen percent. [whispered] That's basically free money just sitting there.
1062 Character B: [explosively] Free money? [Hollow laugh] I need three jobs just to make rent! [quieting down] My savings account has twelve dollars. [defeated whisper] Twelve. I bought a sandwich yesterday and had an existential crisis.
Character A: [obliviously cheerful] Check out my home office! [proudly] Custom built-ins, ergonomic everything. [Contented sigh] Working from home feels like a vacation now. [boastfully] The accountant said I can write off half of it!
1063 Character B: [monotone] I work from my kitchen table. [Frustrated groan] It wobbles. [building anger] My roommate makes smoothies during my Zoom calls. [through gritted teeth] Nothing says professional like the sound of crushing ice during quarterly reports.
Character A: [in a pitying tone] Maybe you need a better job? [thoughtfully] I could put in a word at my firm. [Soft chuckle] Though they do require a certain... [trailing off] presentation standard, you know?
1064 Character B: [incredulous] Presentation standard? [Harsh laugh] You mean not looking like I live in a glorified shoebox? [sarcastically sweet] How kind of you to notice. [venomously] Should I mention your cocaine Thursdays from college on my reference?
Character A: [nervously] That was different times! [defensive] Besides, look where I am now. [Clearing throat] Success requires sacrifice. [pontificating] You just need to prioritize, save better, maybe skip the daily lattes or whatever.
1065 Character B: [eerily calm] I don't buy lattes. [Hysterical giggle] I eat ramen twice a day. [building rage] But please, tell me more about sacrifice. [shouting] Was giving up avocado toast your Vietnam?
Character A: [backpedaling] I didn't mean it like that. [awkwardly] Want to see the pool? [trying to lighten mood] It has a waterfall feature! [weakly enthusiastic] The previous owners left their floaties—little flamingo ones!
1066 Character B: [exhaustedly] A pool. [Defeated sigh] I pay extra to use the laundromat. [hollowly] Twenty-five cents for five more minutes of hot water in my shower. [whispering] But sure, tell me about your flamingo floaties.
Character A: [uncertainly] The garage fits three cars. [quieter] Not that I need three spaces. [Nervous laughter] It's mostly storage now, boxes of things I don't even remember buying. [mumbling] Probably should donate some stuff.
1067 Character B: [suddenly bright] Three cars! [Manic laugh] I take two buses to get here. [sardonically] The second one smells like despair and cheese. [deadpan] Sometimes I can't tell which is which anymore.
Character A: [guilty] Look, I know it seems like a lot. [hesitantly] But I worked hard for this. [Defensive huff] Seven years of saving, no vacations. [quietly] My parents did help with the down payment though.
1068 Character B: [explosively] Your parents helped? [Incredulous shriek] Of course they did! [more calmly] Mine sent me a twenty-dollar Applebee's gift card for my birthday. [Weary sigh] I've been saving it for a special occasion—like eviction.

Script: 9f06ae65 | Role: Character B

Character A: [shaky voice] Is that normal? [higher pitch] The wing just bent like that when we hit the cloud! [rapid breathing] Should I press the call button? My hands won't stop sweating and I think I'm going to be sick right here.
1069 Character B: [casual tone] That's just flex, happens every flight. [reassuring] The wings are designed to bend thirty feet without breaking. [Soft chuckle] You're safer here than driving to the airport. Want some gum? It helps with the ears.
Character A: [whispered panic] What was that sound? [Gulp] Like metal grinding against metal! [trembling] Everyone else seems so calm but I swear something's wrong. The flight attendant just rushed past—do you think we're going to crash into the ocean?
1070 Character B: [matter-of-fact] Landing gear retracting, totally routine. [slower pace] I fly twice a week, heard every sound this bird can make. [Yawn] The attendant's probably just getting coffee started. We're nowhere near water anyway, just over Kansas.
Character A: [nervous laugh] Kansas? But the map showed— [confused mumbling] never mind. [Quick exhale] You fly twice a week? How do you not lose your mind? My therapist said to try meditation but my brain keeps imagining worst-case scenarios.
1071 Character B: [amused] After three hundred flights, it becomes like riding a bus. [quieter] Though my first time? [Snort] I gripped the armrest so hard they practically had to pry me off. Now I sleep before we even take off usually.
Character A: [defensive] Well excuse me for having normal human survival instincts! [sarcastically] Not everyone can be a flying zen master. [softer] Actually, how do you sleep through turbulence? This bumping makes my stomach flip inside out completely.
1072 Character B: [drowsy tone] Noise-canceling headphones, melatonin, and accepting fate. [more animated] Plus, turbulence is just potholes in the sky. [Chuckle] Never crashed a plane yet. Statistics say you're more likely to win the lottery twice than die flying.
Character A: [desperately] Statistics don't help when you're thirty thousand feet up! [voice cracking] My wife made me download this meditation app but— [Sharp intake] Oh god, are we turning? Why are we banking so hard right now?
1073 Character B: [patient explanation] Standard flight path adjustment, probably avoiding weather. [warmly] Your wife sounds smart though. [thoughtful pause] Try this: count five things you see, four you hear, three you can touch. Old anxiety trick my daughter taught me.
Character A: [breathing deeply] Okay... five things... [steadier voice] Seat fabric, your briefcase, terrible carpet, exit sign, flight magazine. [surprised] That actually helped a little. [curiously] You have anxiety too? But you seem so completely collected and calm.
1074 Character B: [confessional tone] Controlled it, never conquered it. [lighter] Twenty years ago I was you, death-gripping some poor stranger's armrest. [Soft laugh] Exposure therapy, basically. Now flying's where I get my best thinking done, ironically enough.
Character A: [hopeful whisper] So it really does get better? [stammering] Because right now I'm contemplating never leaving solid ground again. [nervous giggle] My brother's wedding is in Seattle next month and I'm already dreading the return flight home.
1075 Character B: [encouraging] Each flight gets ten percent easier, promise. [professionally] I started with short hops, built confidence gradually. [warmer tone] By your brother's wedding, you'll be the one reassuring someone else. Trust the process, trust the pilots, breathe.
Character A: [gradually calming] The breathing does help, thanks. [thoughtfully] You know, you're much nicer than the business travelers in movies. [small laugh] They always show you guys as cold, typing aggressively on laptops, ignoring everyone around you completely.
1076 Character B: [mock offense] Hey, I type very gently on my laptop! [genuinely] But yeah, we're not all robots. [contemplative] Flying this much, you see humanity's whole spectrum. Helping nervous flyers is just paying forward kindness I once received.
Character A: [relieved sigh] I think we're descending now? [increasingly excited] The pressure in my ears changed and— [happier] Oh wow, I can see city lights! We're actually going to land safely! I survived my first flight officially!
1077 Character B: [proud tone] See? Told you we'd make it. [instructional] When wheels touch down, you'll hear reverse thrusters roar. [reassuring] Totally normal, just slowing us down. You did great for a first-timer, really. Most people cry more.
Character A: [embarrassed laugh] Who says I didn't cry? [jokingly] The bathroom visit wasn't just about my tiny bladder. [sincere] But seriously, thank you. You turned my nightmare into something manageable. Can I buy you a coffee in the terminal?
1078 Character B: [touched] That's kind of you, but I've got a connection. [warmly] Here's my card though—email me after your brother's wedding. [chuckling softly] Let me know if you helped any nervous flyers. The cycle continues, my friend.

Script: 9bf753a5 | Role: Character B

Character A: [high-pitched squeal] OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! [breathless] Is this really—no way, it can't be the limited edition vinyl collection! [getting louder] Mom and Dad actually found it? This has been sold out everywhere for months!
1079 Character B: [shrieking] WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! [trembling] Mine feels like jewelry—oh please be the necklace, please be the necklace! [faster] The weight is perfect, the box size is right, I'm literally shaking right now, I can't even open it properly!
Character A: [whispered excitement] Okay, okay, let's open them at the same time. [building intensity] Ready? One... two... [explosive shout] THREE! YES! IT IS! IT'S THE COMPLETE BEATLES REMASTERED SET! Look at this gorgeous packaging!
1080 Character B: [piercing scream] AHHHHH! [sobbing with joy] It's grandmother's sapphire pendant! [quieter, emotional] The one from the estate that I thought was gone forever. How did they even get this? My hands won't stop trembling, this is absolutely insane.
Character A: [choked up] Stop it, you're going to make me cry too! [sniffling] That necklace is stunning on you. [more composed] Hey, there's another box under here with your name—it's suspiciously book-shaped and extremely heavy.
1081 Character B: [suspicious tone] No freaking way. [gradually louder] If this is what I think it is... [screech] THE FIRST EDITION HARRY POTTER SET! WITH THE TYPOS! These cost more than my car! Are Mom and Dad completely insane this year?
Character A: [laughing hysterically] We must have been exceptionally good this year! [sarcastically] Or they're buttering us up for something. [nervous giggle] Remember last time they were this generous? They announced they were selling the lake house right after dinner.
1082 Character B: [defensive shout] Don't you dare jinx this! [pleading] Let us have this perfect moment! [whispered conspiracy] Though you're right, this is suspicious. Check that envelope tucked behind the tree—it has both our names written on it.
Character A: [reading slowly] "Girls, these gifts are from Aunt Margaret's inheritance." [voice breaking] She left us each ten thousand dollars specifically for... [crying] "something that would make your hearts sing." I can't read anymore through these tears.
1083 Character B: [sobbing] That beautiful woman! [hiccupping through tears] She always said life was too short for practical gifts. [soft whisper] Remember how she'd sneak us candy at every family dinner? [louder, emotional] This is so perfectly her!
Character A: [gentle tone] She knew us so well. [more firmly] Your love for rare books, my vinyl obsession. [wistful sigh] Even from beyond, she's still giving the most thoughtful gifts. Should we call Mom and Dad to thank them now?
1084 Character B: [wiping tears, sniffling] In a minute. [determined] First, I'm putting on this necklace and you're playing that vinyl. [getting excited again] We're going to have the most epic Christmas morning dance party Aunt Margaret would have absolutely loved!
Character A: [brightening up] Yes! Beatles or Rolling Stones first? [mischievous tone] Actually, no—let's start with her favorite. [shouting] Where's that Ella Fitzgerald Christmas album? The one she played every single December without fail? That's the perfect tribute!
1085 Character B: [squealing again] Bottom shelf, red sleeve! [rushed words] I saw it earlier! This necklace catches the tree lights perfectly—she would have loved seeing this. [voice cracking] God, I miss her. These aren't just presents; they're messages from her.
Character A: [reflective whisper] Every Christmas she'd say presents should create memories, not fill closets. [normal volume] She'd be so proud we're crying happy tears. [giggling] Remember when she gave Dad that karaoke machine just to torture him into singing?
1086 Character B: [bursting with laughter] He was mortified! [through giggles] But by New Year's Eve he was doing full Elvis impersonations! [more seriously] That woman had gift-giving magic. [softly] I hope we inherited at least a fraction of her thoughtfulness.
Character A: [steady voice] We did—look what you got me last year. [emotional] That signed album that you drove three states to find. [firmly] That's pure Aunt Margaret energy. Speaking of which, should we open the rest or savor this moment?
1087 Character B: [dramatically] Savor, definitely savor! [laughing] The other presents can wait—they'll pale in comparison anyway. [excitedly] Get that record player going! I want to dance around in grandmother's necklace like we're in an old Hollywood movie!
Character A: [announcing grandly] Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Chapman sisters' memorial Christmas spectacular! [quieter, loving] Featuring Aunt Margaret's impeccable taste and way too much hot chocolate. [shouting with joy] This is officially the best Christmas morning in the history of everything!
1088 Character B: [yelling over music] TURN IT UP LOUDER! [singing badly] Let the whole neighborhood know the Chapman girls are having the time of their lives! [breathlessly happy] Aunt Margaret, wherever you are—[choking up] thank you for still making Christmas magical!

1089 Customer Support: [briskly] Good morning, FitLife Gym, this is Sarah speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today?
Customer: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I'm calling because—[sighs heavily]—the leg press machine has been broken for THREE weeks now. [irritated] When exactly is someone going to fix it?
1090 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh, I see, let me just pull up your... [more quickly] What's your member number? [reassuring] We've had some delays with our maintenance contractor, but I'll check the status right away.
Customer: [exasperated] It's 4-4-7-2-9. [sarcastically] You know, I'm paying ninety dollars a month for equipment that actually, um, works? [groans] This is getting ridiculous.
1091 Customer Support: [hurriedly] Yes, I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [more calmly] According to my system here, the part was ordered last Monday and should... [hesitant] should arrive by Friday.
Customer: [louder] Friday? That's what you guys told me last week! [disbelieving] Do you realize that's almost a month of broken equipment?
1092 Customer Support: [defensive] Sir, I know it's been—[quickly] Look, I can offer you a partial credit for this month. [more sympathetically] Would twenty-five percent off help compensate for the inconvenience?
Customer: [scoffs] Twenty-five percent? [slowly] One major machine out of, what, fifteen total? [firmly] That math doesn't really add up, does it?
1093 Customer Support: [briskly] Let me speak with my manager real quick. [more quietly] Can you hold for just... actually, no, stay on. [decisively] I'm authorized to offer forty percent off this month.
Customer: [skeptical] And what happens if it's still broken next week? [sighs] I mean, your track record isn't exactly inspiring confidence here.
1094 Customer Support: [quickly] If it's not fixed by Monday, we'll—[more confidently] I'll personally ensure you get a full month free. [reassuring] I'm making a note in your file right now.
Customer: [calmer] Okay, that's... that's better. [curiously] But why can't you guys just get a temporary replacement or something?
1095 Customer Support: [hurriedly] Budget constraints, honestly—corporate has to approve any rentals over five hundred dollars. [frustrated] Trust me, we've asked multiple times already.
Customer: [resigned] Right, corporate. [chuckles dryly] Always comes down to that, doesn't it? [more seriously] Can you at least email me confirmation of this credit?
1096 Customer Support: [efficiently] Absolutely, sending it now to the email we have on file. [quickly] Is that still the Gmail address ending in 847?
Customer: [confirming] Yeah, that's the one. [sighs] Look, I appreciate you working with me here, I'm just... [tiredly] I'm tired of having to call about this.
1097 Customer Support: [sympathetically] No, I totally get it—you shouldn't have to. [more firmly] I'm escalating this to regional management today. [determined] This has gone on way too long.
Customer: [surprised] Oh, well... thanks. [hopefully] Maybe that'll actually get something done? [cautiously] Should I follow up next week, or...?
1098 Customer Support: [briskly] I'll call YOU on Tuesday with an update, how's that? [reassuring] Between two and four PM, if that works? [quickly] And the credit's already applied.
Customer: [relieved] That works, yeah. [gratefully] Thanks, Sarah, you've been... you've been way more helpful than the last person I talked to. [chuckles] Have a good one.

1103 Customer Support: Properties are evaluated individually using grid coordinates. Your location, G-R-D dash 6-6-2-1-4, sits on a previously unmapped fault line identified in survey F-L-T dash 8-8-5.
Customer: So you're telling me there's a fault line—an actual fault line—under my house? And you just discovered this now, after all these years?
1104 Customer Support: The fault was identified during mandatory reassessment M-R-A dash 2-0-2-4. It's classified as active-adjacent, risk level 9. Would you like information about our payment plan options?
Customer: Payment plans? I—I need to think about whether I can even afford to stay here. Can you send me the full geological report, the one with all the technical details?
1105 Customer Support: I'll email report G-E-O dash 7-7-3-3-1 to your address on file. It includes soil liquefaction data, fault proximity maps, and historical seismic activity for radius code R-A-D dash 4-4.
Customer: This is just—overwhelming. If I cancel my policy entirely, what happens? Do I get any refund on what I've already paid this year?
1106 Customer Support: Cancellation triggers mortgage clause M-C-L dash 9-9-1. Your lender requires continuous coverage. You'd receive prorated refund for unused months, calculated under refund code R-F-D dash 2-2-8-8.
Customer: Of course, the mortgage—I forgot about that requirement completely. Look, can I at least reduce my coverage limits to bring the premium down somehow?
1107 Customer Support: You can adjust to minimum required coverage using modification form M-O-D dash 3-3-7-7. This reduces premium to $3,211 annually. Deductible increases to $25,000 under plan code P-L-N dash 8-8-5-5.
Customer: Twenty-five thousand dollar deductible? That's—that's basically self-insuring at that point! Is there really no middle ground here, no other options?
1108 Customer Support: There's a hybrid option, plan H-Y-B dash 6-6-0-0: $3,950 annual premium, $15,000 deductible. You can also request zone re-evaluation in 12 months using form R-E-V dash 4-4-2-2.
Customer: I guess I'll—I'll take that hybrid plan then, and definitely file for the re-evaluation. This whole thing feels like a nightmare, but what choice do I have?

1109 Customer Support: Medical portal support, this is Janet. Can I have your patient ID and date of birth to access your account?
Customer: Oh, um, yes—my patient ID is... let me find it... P-T-R-3-3-8-1-A, and my birthday is, well, it's April 12th, 1975.
1110 Customer Support: Thank you, PTR3381A. I see your account here with the email ending in 2-3-7 at gmail. What specific issue are you experiencing with the portal?
Customer: So I've been trying to log in for—I don't know—maybe three days now? And it keeps saying invalid credentials even though I'm absolutely positive I'm using the right password.
1111 Customer Support: I can reset that for you right now. First, let me verify the security code we have on file—can you confirm the last four digits of your phone number registered with us?
Customer: That would be... wait, which phone? I think I gave you my cell, so that's 8-9-4-2, unless you have my home number which ends in 6-7-1-1.
1112 Customer Support: I show 8-9-4-2 on file. Perfect. I'm sending a temporary password to your email now—it'll be case number M-D-C-4-5-9-2-K for reference.
Customer: Okay, I'm—hold on—I'm checking my email right now and... nothing yet? Should it come immediately or does it take a few minutes usually?
1113 Customer Support: It should arrive within 2-3 minutes. The temporary password will start with T-M-P followed by eight digits, and you'll need to change it upon first login.
Customer: Oh wait, there it is! T-M-P-7-7-2-9-4-8-3-1, got it. But now—sorry—where exactly do I go to change this to something I'll remember?
1114 Customer Support: Once you log in with that temporary password, it'll automatically redirect you to the password reset page. Make sure your new password contains at least one uppercase letter, one number, and eight characters minimum.
Customer: Right, okay, so I'm typing it in now and—oh no—it's saying account locked? Something about too many failed attempts with error code E-R-R-0-0-4-5.
1115 Customer Support: That's a security lockout from your previous attempts. Let me override that—one moment. Try refreshing your browser now and use that same temporary password.
Customer: Refreshing... refreshing... okay, yes! I'm in finally, and now it's asking for—what's this—a verification PIN to my phone?
1116 Customer Support: That's our two-factor authentication. You should receive a six-digit code via text message to the number ending in 8-9-4-2 within thirty seconds.
Customer: The code just came through—5-8-8-2-1-6—and I entered it, but now there's this whole terms and conditions thing that's like twenty pages long?
1117 Customer Support: You can scroll to the bottom and click accept. After that, you'll be on the password creation screen where you'll set your permanent password.
Customer: Alright, I made my new password and—thank goodness—I'm finally seeing my dashboard here with my appointment on the 23rd at 2:30.
1118 Customer Support: Excellent. I've noted everything under case M-D-C-4-5-9-2-K. Is there anything else you need help with regarding the portal today?
Customer: No, I think—actually wait, yes—how do I download my lab results from last week, the ones from November 8th?

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1119 [Disappointed] I know I said I'd be there, but my kid just threw up all over the—the bathroom is like a disaster zone right now. [Sigh] [Fast] [Angry] So apparently my boss just decided, like five minutes ago, that this report has to be done tonight—tonight!—and I'm stuck here until who knows when. [Sad] My mom's in the hospital again and I just... I can't leave her alone right now, you know? [Slow] Not after what happened last time. [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because the airline totally cares that I have somewhere to be—my flight's been delayed for the third time.

[Angry] I've been on hold with customer service for two hours about this fraud thing and if I hang up now—I'm basically starting over. [Groan] [Fast] [Happy] Plot twist—I'm actually already at a different party and it's kinda amazing and I don't wanna leave! [Chuckle] Sorry not sorry? [Disappointed] [Sigh] The babysitter just canceled and we've called everyone—literally everyone—and nobody can watch the kids tonight. [Sad] I'm having one of those days where I just... I can't pretend to be okay around people, y'know? [Slow] Maybe next time. [Angry] [Fast] My roommate used my car without asking and crashed it into a—a freaking mailbox, and now I'm dealing with insurance and police and ugh! [Whisper] Honestly? [Tsk] [Disappointed] I just realized I double-booked myself and I already promised my grandma I'd have dinner with her tonight.

1120 [Fast] Okay, okay, if you just—if you take this one tiny pill, I'll give you, like, three treats, maybe four. [Laugh] Deal? [Whisper] Come here, buddy, it's just, um, it's just a little vitamin, nothing scary. [Slow] That's it, good boy. [Angry] I've been chasing you around this apartment for twenty minutes! [Groan] Just eat the stupid thing already! [Sarcastic] Oh sure, you'll eat garbage off the street but heaven forbid you take your—your actual medicine. [Tsk] Makes total sense. [Happy] Who wants the special cheese? [Chuckle] Yeah, the special cheese with absolutely nothing hidden inside it whatsoever! [Disappointed] I can't believe you spit it out again. [Sigh] That was, like, that was our fifth attempt, wasn't it? [Slow] The vet said—wait, don't run away—the vet said this would make you feel so much better, I promise. [Sad] [Shout] Get back here! [Fast] No, no, no, not under the bed, anywhere but under the—ugh, seriously? [Sad] Please, baby, you're gonna—you're gonna get sicker if you don't take this, and I just, I can't watch that happen. [Sigh] [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Sarcastic] I went to college for four years and here I am, basically negotiating with a cat. [Fast] Look, peanut butter! [Happy] Your favorite kind with the—oh come on, you always fall for the peanut butter trick! [Whisper] Shh, nobody's gonna hurt you, it's just, um, it's medicine time, okay? [Slow] Nice and easy. [Angry] This cost me forty-seven dollars! [Groan] [Fast] Forty-seven dollars and you're acting like I'm trying to poison you or something! [Disappointed] I thought we were past this whole—this whole drama about pills. [Tsk] Guess I was wrong, huh? [Slow] Remember last time when you finally took it and then you felt better? [Happy] Remember how you were running around again? [Sarcastic] Yeah, sure, make that face. [Laugh] Like I'm the bad guy here, trying to keep you healthy and everything. [Fast] If I crush it up in your food you'll—no wait, you'll taste it, won't you? [Sigh] You always know somehow. [Shout] I'm not giving up! [Angry] We're gonna—we're gonna sit here all day if we have to, you hear me? [Sad] Why do you gotta make this so hard, huh? [Whisper] I'm just, I'm just trying to help you, little one. [Happy] [Slow] There we go, you did it, you actually—oh my god, you swallowed it! [Laugh] Finally!

1121 [Slow] Okay, so I'm just gonna, um, retrace my steps here and—wait, was it left at the fountain or right? [Sigh] Everything looks the same. [Fast] I had the map on my phone but now it's just spinning and spinning and I don't even know which way is north anymore! [Groan] [Whisper] Don't panic, don't panic, you're fine, this is—this is totally fine, right? [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Oh great, another identical street with another unpronounceable name. [Laugh] This is going perfectly. [Happy] Actually, y'know what? This is kinda like an adventure—I mean, when else am I gonna randomly explore... wherever this is? [Chuckle] [Angry] I specifically asked that guy for directions and he just—ugh, he pointed everywhere at once! [Fast] How is that even helpful? Maybe if I just, er, pick a direction and commit to it instead of going in circles like some sort of—[Disappointed] No, that's how I got here. [Sigh] [Slow] The hotel has to be around here somewhere, it's gotta be, because I only walked for like fifteen—[Sad] or was it thirty minutes? [Shout] Excuse me! Sorry! Do you speak—never mind, they're gone. [Groan] [Fast] Why does everyone walk so fast here? [Whisper] [Slow] If I call someone for help right now, I'll literally never hear the end of it, so that's, um, that's plan Z. [Happy] Oh! Oh, that café looks familiar—wait no, that's just... every café apparently looks exactly like that one. [Disappointed] [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Sure, let's add rain to this situation, because being lost wasn't quite atmospheric enough. [Tsk] I'm basically just gonna pretend I meant to come here, like this was the plan all along, y'know? [Chuckle] [Fast] Fake it till you find it, right? [Angry] This street name is literally just consonants—how do you even—? [Slow] Okay, breathe, getting mad at street signs isn't gonna help. [Sad] [Whisper] I had one simple task: hotel to museum and back, and somehow I've ended up in what looks like... industrial something. [Shout] [Happy] Wait, is that the cathedral? That's the cathedral! I can navigate from—oh. [Disappointed] That's a completely different building. Um, honestly, worst case scenario, I just grab a taxi and show them the—[Fast] [Angry] except I don't even know the hotel name in this language! [Slow] [Sarcastic] "Download the offline maps," they said. "You'll be fine," they said. [Laugh] Yeah, super fine right now. [Whisper] Okay so if the sun sets over there, then that means—actually, I dunno, does that even work the same way here? [Tsk] [Sigh] [Happy] [Fast] You know what? I'm alive, I'm not injured, and there's bound to be wifi somewhere, so really, how bad can this actually get? [Chuckle]

SCENARIO: Calmly describing a small argument with a sibling, then remembering what they said in anger, then hearing how cruel it sounds out loud, spiraling into sibling guilt
==================================================

[casual]
So I had this thing with my brother earlier. Nothing major, just— you know how he is about the car. I asked to borrow it for like two hours and he got all weird about it.

[a bit annoyed]
And I'm like, dude, I just need to get to the store and back, it's not a big deal. But he starts going on about how I never ask in advance and how it's inconsiderate or whatever.

[more frustrated]
So then I'm like, fine, forget it, I'll figure something else out. But he keeps going, right? Like he won't drop it. And I just— [exhales] I got fed up.

[matter-of-fact]
I told him he was being selfish and that maybe if he wasn't such a control freak about everything, people would actually want to be around him. [pause] You know, just to shut him up.

[stopping short]
But saying it now... [nervous laugh] God, that sounds really— that's actually pretty harsh, isn't it?

[realizing] [building anxiety]
Oh no. Oh my god, I actually said that to him. "People would actually want to be around him"? What is wrong with me? He's been having such a hard time making friends at his new school and I just—

[spiraling] [voice cracking]
[whimper] I'm the worst sister ever. I'm literally the worst person. He probably thinks I hate him now.

SCENARIO: Excited about a new hobby, then discouraged by how hard it is, then finally gets it right while explaining
==================================================

[excited]
Oh my god, I have to tell you about pottery class! I signed up yesterday and had my first session this morning and it's— it's like so zen, you know? Like I can already picture myself making these beautiful bowls and mugs and just, like, having this whole artistic side I never knew about.

[enthusiastic]
The instructor, Sarah, she made it look so easy. Just centering the clay and pulling up these perfect walls, and I was like "okay yeah, I can totally do this." Like how hard can it be, right? It's just clay.

[frustrated] [deflated]
Ugh, but then I actually tried it and— God, it's like the clay has a mind of its own. My first three attempts just completely collapsed, like just— [groan] —just fell apart in my hands. And everyone else seemed to be getting it, at least a little bit, and I'm just sitting there with this sad pile of, of clay mush.

[discouraged]
I was honestly ready to just give up. Like maybe I'm just not a creative person, maybe I should stick to— I don't know, spreadsheets or whatever. Some people are just born artistic and some people aren't, and I was starting to think I'm definitely in the second category.

[focused] [determined]
But then Sarah came over and showed me this breathing technique, and she was like "feel the clay, don't fight it," and I tried one more time, really focusing on— oh wait, I'm actually doing the hand motions right now aren't I? [laugh]

[amazed] [realizing]
But that's the thing! I can feel it in my hands still, like my muscles remember exactly how it felt when the clay finally started cooperating. Like I can actually picture myself doing it again, and— oh my god, I think I actually get it now.

[excited] [confident]
I made this little wonky bowl, nothing fancy, but it stayed up! It didn't collapse! And now I'm like... I'm already thinking about what I want to try next week. Maybe I actually am creative after all.

SCENARIO: Complaining about a terrible Uber driver, then remembers they put in the wrong pickup address
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my God, I had the worst Uber driver today. Like seriously, this guy was— he was completely insane. He picks me up twenty minutes late, right? Twenty minutes! And then he's driving like a maniac, like weaving through traffic, slamming on the brakes every two seconds.

[annoyed]
And the whole time he's on his phone, like talking to someone in— I don't even know what language, but he's yelling, and I'm just sitting there thinking I'm gonna die in this car. [scoff] Like I literally thought about getting out at a red light, that's how bad it was.

[angry]
So then we get to my destination and he has the audacity to be like "wrong address" and starts arguing with me about where I wanted to go. I'm like, dude, this is literally the address I put in the app, what are you talking about?

[confused]
Wait, actually, let me just— let me check what I... 

[quieter] [embarrassed]
Oh. Oh no. I put in... I put in my old apartment address. The one from like three years ago.

[guilty] [small laugh]
God, this poor guy. He drove to the right place and I was probably sitting there looking at him like he was an idiot. [groan] I feel terrible now. I should probably change my rating.
