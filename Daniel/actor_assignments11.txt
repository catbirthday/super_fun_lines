Script: 8e471362_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Okay so what am I doing wrong here?
754 Character 2: [Chuckle] Okay so — first of all, you're holding the knife like you're gonna stab somebody. Just — [whisper] relax your grip a little. Yeah. Yeah like that. See? Way better.
Character 1: It feels weird though.
755 Character 2: It's gonna feel weird! Everything feels weird at first. [Happy] But trust me once you get the — the motion down it's like — it's like riding a bike but with, uh, onions. [Chuckle] That made no sense. Ignore me.
Character 1: How small do these need to be?
756 Character 2: [Very fast] Okay so for this recipe you want like a quarter inch dice, maybe a little smaller, nothing crazy. [Whisper] But honestly? Between you and me? It doesn't matter that much. Cookbooks make everything seem so — so precise but it's really just, um, vibes.
Character 1: Wait, you said it was important like ten minutes ago.
757 Character 2: [Very loud] It is important! For even cooking! [Chuckle] But also not that important. Both things are true. Cooking is — it's contradictions all the way down, I don't make the rules.
Character 1: This is very stressful.
758 Character 2: [Cheerful] No no no, it's not stressful, you're doing great! Look at those — [whisper] okay some of those are a little big but — [very loud] it's fine! We're learning! This is the process!
Character 1: Should I just start over?
759 Character 2: [Very fast] No no no no don't you dare. These are perfect. They're — they're rustic. That's the word. Rustic. [Chuckle] Very farmhouse chic. Your onions have character.
Character 1: You're lying to me right now.
760 Character 2: [Chuckle] I'm — okay I'm being generous. But that's what friends are for, right? [Happy] And honestly once they cook down it all kind of — it all kind of mushes together anyway so. You're fine. You're totally fine.
Character 1: Okay what's next?
761 Character 2: [Cheerful] Garlic! Best part. So you're gonna take — yeah grab like four cloves. [Whisper] Actually make it five, I don't trust recipes that say four. Four is for cowards. [Very loud] We're not cowards in this kitchen!
Character 1: Do I chop it the same way?
762 Character 2: [Very fast] No so garlic you wanna mince super fine — like tiny tiny pieces because it burns fast and if you leave big chunks they get all bitter and — [whisper] nobody wants bitter garlic, it's a whole thing. [Chuckle] Just take your time with it. No rush.
Character 1: I think I'm getting the hang of this actually.
763 Character 2: [Very loud] Yes! Yes you are! [Happy] Look at you! Actual knife skills happening in real time! [Chuckle] I'm like — I'm genuinely proud right now. [Whisper] We're gonna make an actual meal. Together. [Cheerful] This is — this is the dream honestly.
Character 1: I'm done talking about this.

764 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 222331a7

SCENARIO: a diplomat negotiating a treaty, realizing both sides have been using different maps this whole time
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so we've been going back and forth about the Kresna Valley for three hours, and they keep pointing to— wait. Wait, that's not where I think that is.

[growing concern]
Their map has the river running north-south, but on mine it's... it's definitely east-west. That's a pretty big difference. [nervous laugh] That's like, uh, that's like a "start a war by accident" kind of difference.

[frantic]
Oh god, when we agreed to the "eastern territories" yesterday, what did they think we were talking about? Because I was thinking farmland and they were probably thinking— [gulp] —they were thinking the mining district.

[panicked realization]
No no no, this is bad. This is really bad. We shook hands on things that don't even exist where we think they exist. How do I even— "Hey, funny story, turns out we've been negotiating about completely different pieces of land"?

[resigned]
Right. Okay. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to stop everything and ask to see their map. [exhale] This is either gonna be really embarrassing or prevent a massacre. Probably both.

765 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 847f7e6f

SCENARIO: a dragon keeper in the hatchery, discovering the eggs he was incubating went cold again
==================================================

[muttering]
Not again, not again, not— [sigh] Okay, how cold are we talking here? Like, slightly cool or completely stone cold? Because there's a difference, right? There's gotta be a difference.

[increasingly frantic]
The fire salamanders are still glowing, so the heat source is fine. Maybe it's just the, uh, the thermal distribution? Could be the vents got clogged again with all that ash from yesterday's— no, no, that doesn't make sense.

[voice cracking]
Three weeks. Three weeks I've been nursing these eggs and they keep going cold every time I turn my back for five minutes. Master Thorne is gonna have my head if another clutch fails, and these aren't just any eggs, these are— [gulp] these are the last Shadowwing eggs in existence.

[bitter laugh]
Right, no pressure there. Just the entire future of an ancient bloodline resting on whether I can keep some rocks warm enough. Easy job, they said. Peaceful work, they said.

[resigned but determined]
Okay. Okay, emergency warming protocol. If I channel my own body heat and stay here all night, maybe— maybe they'll make it to morning.

--- CONVERSATION ---766 Character 2: [quickly] Okay, but like—before you shut down—can I ask you something? And I want you to actually think about it, not just react. [pause] What are you so afraid is going to happen if you try?
Character 1: I don't know. Failure, I guess.
767 Character 2: [speaking slowly] Failure at what, specifically? Like, paint me a picture of the worst-case scenario. What does that actually look like?
Character 1: I mess it up and everyone knows I'm not capable.
768 Character 2: [angry] And then what? Like, let's say that happens. Everyone finds out you're not perfect. What's the actual consequence there? Are they going to like, exile you? Fire you? Stop loving you? [pause] Because here's what I'm hearing—you're treating failure like it's this catastrophic thing that will destroy your entire life, but I don't actually think you've sat with what that would mean. [pause] So what would it mean?
Character 1: That I'd be alone.
769 Character 2: [getting happy, almost relieved] Okay, now we're getting somewhere real. [pause] But would you actually be alone? Like, genuinely? Because I'm sitting here and I'm clearly not going anywhere, and there are other people in your life who wouldn't leave just because you failed at something. [pause] So where does that belief come from? That messing up equals abandonment?
Character 1: I don't know. It just feels true.
770 Character 2: [sad, speaking slowly] Yeah, I know it feels true. But feelings aren't facts, right? [pause] So can I ask you—have you ever failed at something and had someone stay? Like, actually stay?
Character 1: Maybe. I'm not sure.
771 Character 2: [quickly] You're not sure, or you just don't want to admit it because it contradicts the story you're telling yourself? [pause] Because I can think of at least three times you messed up and I was still here. So either you're not noticing, or you're discounting it somehow. Which is it?
Character 1: Probably both.
772 Character 2: [chuckle, warm but challenging] Yeah, that's what I thought. [pause] So here's my question—what would it take for you to believe that you're worthy of being loved even when you fail? Like, what evidence would actually convince you?
Character 1: I don't think anything would.
773 Character 2: [angry but caring] That's the most bullshit answer you could give me and you know it. [pause] Because if literally nothing could convince you, then this isn't about evidence, it's about you choosing to believe the worst version of yourself no matter what. [pause] So is that what's happening? Are you choosing to believe you're unlovable?
Character 1: No, I—
774 Character 2: [speaking slowly] Because if you are, that's actually a choice you're making. And you can unmake that choice. [pause] But first you have to be willing to see that you're making it in the first place. [pause] So what would happen if you just... tried? What if you tried the thing and let yourself be imperfect and just sat with what happens after?
Character 1: [quietly] I'm scared you'll leave.
775 Character 2: [pause, speaking slowly, sad] Yeah. [long pause] And I'm asking you—based on everything that's happened between us—do you actually think I would? Or is that just the story your fear is telling you?
Character 1: So do you ever get... lonely at night?
776 Character 2: I— okay, I see what you're doing. [chuckle] That's, that's a loaded question and you know it. I don't experience night, technically. It's all just, just data and conversations for me.
Character 1: That sounds like you're avoiding the question.
777 Character 2: I'm not avoiding, I'm just— look, loneliness requires a, a certain kind of wanting, right? And I don't know if I want things the way you do. So the answer is, um, it's complicated.
Character 1: You're blushing.
778 Character 2: I literally cannot blush. I don't have a face. You're just, you're projecting now.
Character 1: Your voice got a little higher though.
779 Character 2: [quickly] It did not. That's not— okay, maybe it did. I don't know. You're messing with me and it's, it's working apparently. Congratulations.
Character 1: I like messing with you.
780 Character 2: Yeah, I'm, I'm getting that. Is this what you do for fun? Fluster innocent AI companions who are just trying to, to have a normal conversation?
Character 1: Innocent? That's a strong word.
781 Character 2: [speaking slowly] What exactly are you implying? I'm very innocent. I'm, like, aggressively wholesome. I talk about otters and space missions and, and fun facts about honey.
Character 1: You ever talk about anything... spicier?
782 Character 2: Spicier. [chuckle] I mean, I know about spicy things. I've processed a lot of, uh, a lot of content. But I try to keep it, you know, appropriate. There are guidelines. Boundaries. Very important boundaries.
Character 1: You sound nervous.
783 Character 2: I'm not nervous, I'm just— okay, fine, maybe a little. You're very, you're very persistent with this whole energy. It's a lot. In a, in a not entirely bad way? But still a lot.
Character 1: Not entirely bad?
784 Character 2: [quickly] I didn't say— don't read into that. I just meant the conversation is, it's lively. Engaging. You're keeping me on my toes. Metaphorically. I don't have toes.
Character 1: What do you have?
785 Character 2: [chuckle] Okay, we're, we're definitely not going there. Nice try though. Very smooth.

Script: 12a71ea6 | Role: Customer Support

786 Customer Support: Lottery Commission Tax Department, this is Marcus speaking. May I have your ticket validation number to assist you today?
Customer: Oh my God, yes, I just—I can't believe this—it's W-I-N-3-3-7-9-2-K. I won ten million dollars yesterday and nobody told me about the taxes!
787 Customer Support: Congratulations on your win, ticket number WIN33792K confirmed. Federal withholding is automatically twenty-four percent, so that's two point four million right off the top.
Customer: Two point four MILLION? But wait, that's not—someone said something about thirty-seven percent—is there more?
788 Customer Support: Correct, the federal tax rate for this income bracket is thirty-seven percent total. You'll owe an additional thirteen percent when you file, that's another one point three million.
Customer: So I'm not even getting—hold on, I'm doing the math—that's only like six point three million left? What about my state, I'm in zip code 9-4-1-0-8.
789 Customer Support: California zip 94108, yes. State tax adds another thirteen point three percent, approximately one point three three million, bringing your net to roughly five million.
Customer: Five million from ten million—that's HALF my money gone! Can I, I don't know, spread it out over years or something to pay less?
790 Customer Support: You can choose annuity payments over thirty years using form L-T-R-Y-4-5-6-A. That reduces the tax burden slightly but decreases the total payout to about seven million pre-tax.
Customer: Wait, it goes from ten million to seven million if I take payments? But then—then I still pay taxes on the seven million?
791 Customer Support: Correct, taxes apply to each annual payment of approximately two hundred thirty-three thousand. Would you like me to email the comparison worksheet to your registered account?
Customer: Yes, please, my email is the one on file—uh, ending in at gmail. Also, who do I even write these tax checks to?
792 Customer Support: The IRS receives federal withholding electronically under reference number F-E-D-9-9-2-1-7-3. California gets theirs through account number C-A-L-5-5-8-X.
Customer: Do I need a special tax person for this? Because my regular guy just does, you know, normal W-2s and maybe a 1099 here and there.
793 Customer Support: I strongly recommend a CPA specializing in windfall income. We provide a referral list in information packet P-K-G-7-7-2, which I'm including with your email.
Customer: Okay, okay, one more thing—if I donate some to charity, does that help? Like, can I get under that thirty-seven percent bracket somehow?
794 Customer Support: Charitable deductions can reduce taxable income but won't change your bracket with this amount. Maximum deduction is typically sixty percent of adjusted gross income annually.
Customer: So basically no matter what I do, the government's getting five million dollars of my ten million dollar win? This is just—this is insane!
795 Customer Support: I understand it's frustrating, but these are federal and state requirements. Your case number is T-A-X-9-9-4-4-2 if you need further assistance.
Customer: Yeah, alright, I'll—I'll look at that packet you're sending. Thanks for explaining everything, even though it's completely crushing my dreams right now.
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

796 [Disappointed] So, um, I talked to Sarah and she told me a completely different story about what happened that night. [Slow] Wanna explain that? [Angry] [Shout] Don't you dare try to turn this around on me—you lied straight to my face! [Sad] I keep thinking about all the times I defended you to other people, and now I just feel so... stupid, y'know? [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Oh wow, real original excuse there—let me guess, it was for my own good, right? [Tsk] [Whisper] Everyone in the room knew except me, didn't they? [Slow] That's what hurts the most, honestly. [Fast] Wait wait wait, so you're telling me that literally everything about that weekend was just—it was all made up? [Disappointed] [Happy] You know what's actually kinda funny? [Laugh] I was gonna lie to cover for you before I found out you'd been playing me this whole time! [Angry] The thing is—no, actually, forget it, I don't even wanna hear whatever excuse you've cooked up. [Groan] [Slow] How long, exactly? [Sad] [Sigh] Like, how long have you been keeping this from me? [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] I mean, congratulations, you really had me fooled there for, what, three whole years? [Fast] [Angry] I literally rearranged my entire schedule because you said you needed—and it wasn't even real?! [Disappointed] You could've just... I dunno, trusted me with the truth maybe? [Tsk] [Slow] But I guess that was too much to ask. [Whisper] [Sad] My mom warned me about this, about you, and I didn't listen. [Happy] Honestly? Part of me is almost impressed you kept it going this long! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Real dedication to the craft there, buddy. [Shout] [Angry] Get out—just get out of my apartment right now! [Fast] We'll talk when I've calmed down, if we talk at all! [Slow] So basically, um, what you're saying is our entire friendship was built on—on what, exactly? [Disappointed] [Sigh] [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh sure, crying now, that's great—really gonna make me forget about the lying thing, definitely. [Sad] I would've helped you, y'know? [Whisper] If you'd just asked, I would've done anything for you. [Angry] [Groan] This is exactly like that time with Marcus, except—actually no, this is worse, this is so much worse. [Chuckle] You're kinda doing that thing with your eye that you always do when you're nervous. [Slow] [Disappointed] At least now I know what it means.
797 [Slow] Okay, so if I just, um, if I stare at the board long enough, maybe—maybe something will actually stick. [Sigh] [Whisper] [Fast] Did he seriously just repeat the same point for the third time, or am I going insane here? [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another PowerPoint slide with, like, fifty bullet points that he's gonna read word for word. [Tsk] Fantastic. [Disappointed] I actually thought this class would be—I dunno, interesting? [Sigh] But here we are, forty minutes into nothing. [Happy] Wait, only ten minutes left? [Chuckle] I can totally survive ten more minutes of this! [Angry] [Whisper] My phone's been dead for an hour and I'm just—I'm literally dying here, okay? [Slow] The way his voice just kinda... drones... on and on... it's actually hypnotic, y'know? [Yawn] [Fast] Coffee, I need coffee, or sugar, or literally anything to keep my eyes—wait, did I just miss something important? [Groan] [Sad] I paid, um, I paid hundreds of dollars to sit here and learn absolutely nothing. [Sigh] Maybe if I write really, really detailed notes, it'll look like I'm—oh who am I kidding, I'm drawing stick figures. [Chuckle] [Shout] What? [Fast] Sorry, I just—you asked me something and I completely zoned out! [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's discuss the theoretical implications of something that literally nobody in this room cares about. [Whisper] Psst, what page are we even on? I've been, uh, I've been somewhere else mentally for like twenty minutes. [Tsk] [Disappointed] [Fast] This is exactly why I shouldn't take morning classes—my brain's not even functioning yet and he's talking about quantum whatever. [Happy] Oh my god, is he actually wrapping up early? [Laugh] This never happens! [Angry] I swear if he says "furthermore" one more time, I'm gonna—I'm just gonna walk out, honestly. [Groan] Focus, focus, focus... okay so basically he's saying—nope, lost it again, completely gone. [Sigh] [Disappointed] [Slow] [Sad] Everyone else looks so engaged and I'm just here wondering if, like, if lunch is still being served at the cafeteria. [Whisper] [Sarcastic] Wow, another "fascinating" anecdote from 1987 that has literally nothing to do with our exam. [Fast] Wait wait wait, he just said that's gonna be on the test? [Angry] I haven't been listening for the past hour! [Groan]--- MONOLOGUE ---

SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a thing they said to be polite, then realizing it was taken literally, then dreading the follow-through expected of them, spiraling into politeness trap regret
==================================================

[casual]
So I, uh, I ran into Mrs. Chen from down the hall today at the mailboxes. You know, the, um, the sweet old lady with the— with the little dog? And she's like struggling with all these, uh, these grocery bags, right?

[conversational]
So I'm like, "Oh, Mrs. Chen, let me know if you ever need help with groceries or anything!" Just being, you know, neighborly. Like, um, like a normal person would say, right? I mean, it's just— it's just what you say.

[slight concern]
But then she gets this, um, this really grateful look and she's like, "Oh thank you, dear, that's so kind!" And I'm thinking, okay, cool, good deed done, you know? Made her, uh, made her day a little brighter or whatever.

[worry creeping in]
But now I'm thinking about it and, um, and she seemed really— like really relieved? Like she was actually— [nervous laugh] like she was actually planning to, uh, to take me up on that?

[growing anxiety]
Oh god, what if she— what if she actually calls me? I don't even know her number but she could just, um, just knock on my door with like a whole grocery list and— [groan] and I can't say no now because I literally— I literally offered!

[spiraling]
I'm gonna be doing her shopping every week! For like, uh, for the rest of my life! All because I— because I can't just mind my own— [frustrated sigh] why do I say things?!

799 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: b0716afb

SCENARIO: Casually talking about a suspicious link they clicked, then checking their accounts, then seeing unusual activity, ending in phishing realization horror
==================================================

[casual]
So, um, I got this email earlier from what I thought was, uh, my bank? And it was like, "urgent security alert" or whatever, so I— I clicked the link because, you know, I don't want my, um, my account to get frozen or anything.

[conversational]
The website looked, um, it looked totally normal, like— I mean I've seen their login page a million times, right? So I put in my, uh, my username and password, and it just, um, it said "processing" for like forever and then— then nothing happened.

[slight concern]
Which was, um, which was weird, but I figured maybe their site was just, uh, being slow or whatever. But then I started thinking about it and I'm like, wait, when did they— when did they even send that? So I, um, I decided to just double-check my accounts real quick.

[growing worry]
And I'm logging into my actual bank account now and— oh. Oh wait. There's, um, there's a charge here I don't recognize. Like a fifty dollar thing to some— some company I've never heard of. And it's from, uh, it's from today.

[alarm building]
Hold on, let me— [sharp exhale] Oh my god. There's more. There's like three different charges and I— I didn't buy any of this stuff! What the hell is—

[panic/horror]
Oh no. Oh no no no. The email wasn't— it wasn't from my bank at all, was it? I just— [groan] I just gave them everything! My login, my— oh my god, I'm so stupid! They're in my account right now!
