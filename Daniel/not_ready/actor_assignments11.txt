Script: 8e471362_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Got my results back today.
754 
Character 2: Oh my god—wait, what? The scan? Already? I thought that wasn't until—hold on, are you okay? Like, what did they say?
Character 1: Clean. No cancer.
755 
Character 2: What? Are you—are you serious? Oh my god, oh my god. That's... I'm literally shaking right now. You're really—you're really okay?
Character 1: Yeah. Six months of hell, but yeah.
756 
Character 2: I can't—holy shit, I can't even imagine what you're feeling right now. Like, this whole time you've been so... I dunno, calm? And I've been freaking out for you.
Character 1: Don't really feel anything yet. Weird, right?
757 
Character 2: No no no, that's—that's totally normal, actually. My aunt said the same thing when she got her all-clear. It's like your brain needs time to, y'know, catch up or whatever.
Character 1: The doctor kept smiling. Made me nervous.
758 
Character 2: Wait, nervous? Even though it was good news? That's kinda—actually no, I get it. Like you're waiting for the "but" or something, right? God, I'm so relieved though.
Character 1: My mom cried. In the parking lot. For twenty minutes.
759 
Character 2: Oh babe, of course she did. She's been—I mean, we've all been so worried, but your mom? She's basically been living at that hospital with you.
Character 1: I should feel happy. I don't.
760 
Character 2: Hey, you don't—you don't have to feel any particular way, okay? You just went through something literally traumatic. Your body's probably still in like, survival mode or whatever.
Character 1: Everyone keeps asking how I'm celebrating.
761 
Character 2: Ugh, people are so—they mean well but like, what do they expect? You to throw a party? Sometimes I think people just don't know what to say, y'know?
Character 1: I just want to sleep for a week.
762 
Character 2: Then do that! Honestly, you've earned the right to do whatever the hell you want right now. Sleep, don't sleep, eat ice cream for breakfast—literally no one gets to judge you.
Character 1: Will you tell the others? I can't keep having this conversation.
763 
Character 2: Oh absolutely, yeah yeah, I got you. I'll handle everything—the group chat, your sister, whoever. You just... breathe, okay? Just breathe.

764 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 222331a7

SCENARIO: a diplomat negotiating a treaty, realizing both sides have been using different maps this whole time
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so we've been going back and forth about the Kresna Valley for three hours, and they keep pointing to— wait. Wait, that's not where I think that is.

[growing concern]
Their map has the river running north-south, but on mine it's... it's definitely east-west. That's a pretty big difference. [nervous laugh] That's like, uh, that's like a "start a war by accident" kind of difference.

[frantic]
Oh god, when we agreed to the "eastern territories" yesterday, what did they think we were talking about? Because I was thinking farmland and they were probably thinking— [gulp] —they were thinking the mining district.

[panicked realization]
No no no, this is bad. This is really bad. We shook hands on things that don't even exist where we think they exist. How do I even— "Hey, funny story, turns out we've been negotiating about completely different pieces of land"?

[resigned]
Right. Okay. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to stop everything and ask to see their map. [exhale] This is either gonna be really embarrassing or prevent a massacre. Probably both.

765 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 847f7e6f

SCENARIO: a dragon keeper in the hatchery, discovering the eggs he was incubating went cold again
==================================================

[muttering]
Not again, not again, not— [sigh] Okay, how cold are we talking here? Like, slightly cool or completely stone cold? Because there's a difference, right? There's gotta be a difference.

[increasingly frantic]
The fire salamanders are still glowing, so the heat source is fine. Maybe it's just the, uh, the thermal distribution? Could be the vents got clogged again with all that ash from yesterday's— no, no, that doesn't make sense.

[voice cracking]
Three weeks. Three weeks I've been nursing these eggs and they keep going cold every time I turn my back for five minutes. Master Thorne is gonna have my head if another clutch fails, and these aren't just any eggs, these are— [gulp] these are the last Shadowwing eggs in existence.

[bitter laugh]
Right, no pressure there. Just the entire future of an ancient bloodline resting on whether I can keep some rocks warm enough. Easy job, they said. Peaceful work, they said.

[resigned but determined]
Okay. Okay, emergency warming protocol. If I channel my own body heat and stay here all night, maybe— maybe they'll make it to morning.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: f9c593d9 | Role: Character A

766 
Character A: [shaky voice] Doctor, I've been waiting for three hours. [nervous laugh] The nurse said you have my test results? [speaking faster] I haven't slept in days thinking about what they might show.
Character B: [hurried tone] Yes, yes, Mr. Johnson. [shuffling sounds] Let me just pull up your file here. [impatiently] The system's being slow today—we're running behind schedule as you can probably tell.
767 
Character A: [trembling] Is it bad news? [voice cracking] You can tell me straight, I just need to know. [barely audible] My wife's in the parking lot because she couldn't handle waiting inside with me.
Character B: [distracted] Your blood work came back mostly normal. [speaking quickly] Cholesterol's a bit high, vitamin D is low. [dismissive tone] Nothing that can't be managed with some lifestyle changes and supplements, really.
768 
Character A: [relieved exhale] Mostly normal? [more anxiously] What does mostly mean exactly? [voice rising] You said mostly—is there something else hiding in those results that you're not telling me about?
Character B: [slightly annoyed] There's a minor elevation in your liver enzymes. [rushed explanation] Could be from medication, alcohol, or just a fluke. [matter-of-fact] We'll retest in six weeks to see if it normalizes.
769 
Character A: [panicked whisper] My father died of liver disease. [voice breaking] Should I be worried? [pleading] Please, Doctor, I need more than six weeks of wondering if I'm following in his footsteps.
Character B: [softer tone] This isn't liver disease, Mr. Johnson. [firm voice] The elevation is minimal—barely outside normal range. [reassuring but quick] Cut back on alcohol, lose ten pounds, you'll likely be fine.
770 
Character A: [desperate laugh] Barely outside normal still means abnormal, doesn't it? [accusatory] You keep checking your watch. [hurt tone] Am I just another checkmark on your list today, or an actual person?
Character B: [defensive] I have twelve more patients to see. [sighing deeply] Look, I understand you're scared. [more gently] But these results don't warrant the level of concern you're experiencing right now.
771 
Character A: [quietly angry] Easy for you to say. [bitter tone] You see these numbers every day—they're just data points. [voice shaking] For me, this is my life, my future, my kids' father we're discussing.
Character B: [pausing] You're right. [apologetic murmur] I'm sorry for rushing. [clearer voice] Let's go through each result properly—your white blood cell count is perfect, kidney function excellent, blood sugar completely normal.
772 
Character A: [surprised] Oh. [gradually calming] That actually does help hearing the good parts. [hopeful whisper] So the liver thing really might be nothing? My anxiety medication could cause that elevation you mentioned?
Character B: [warmly] Absolutely it could. [professional tone] Statins, acetaminophen, even recent exercise can bump those numbers. [reassuring] We're being cautious with the retest, but I'm genuinely not concerned about serious liver issues.
773 
Character A: [deep breath] Thank you for slowing down. [steadier voice] I know you're busy, but this helped. [small laugh] My wife will be so relieved—she made me promise not to leave without clear answers.
Character B: [chuckling] Smart woman. [more relaxed] Here's my direct line if you have questions before the follow-up. [kindly] Try not to Google symptoms—it'll only make your anxiety worse than it already is.
774 
Character A: [genuine laugh] Too late for that advice! [ruefully] I've already diagnosed myself with six fatal conditions this week. [lighter tone] But I'll try to stick to your actual results from now on.
Character B: [amused] Six? That's actually conservative for Google diagnoses. [getting up] Schedule that follow-up with reception. [firmly but friendly] And seriously—moderate exercise, less alcohol, more vitamin D. Simple changes, big impact.
775 
Character A: [gratefully] I will. [more confident] Sorry for taking extra time, Doctor. [thoughtful pause] It's just hard being on this side of the desk, feeling so vulnerable and scared about everything.
Character B: [understanding] Never apologize for advocating for yourself. [gentle tone] That's what good patients do. [sincerely] Take care, Mr. Johnson—I'll see you in six weeks with better numbers, I'm sure.

Script: d8ba7e3a | Role: Character B

Character A: [cheerfully] Oh hello there, neighbor! [getting louder] I've been meaning to introduce myself since you moved in last week. [rapid speech] I'm Barbara from next door—been living here twenty-seven years! [curiously] Where did you move from?
776 
Character B: [quietly] Hi. [pause] I'm from... around. [clearing throat] Just needed a change of scenery, you know how it is. [trailing off] Anyway, nice fence you have here—very sturdy looking, good height.
Character A: [excitedly] Oh yes, we had it installed after the Johnson incident! [whispered conspiratorially] You didn't hear about that? [normal volume] So what do you do for work? I noticed you leave at odd hours.
777 
Character B: [stiffly] I work in... consulting. [nervous chuckle] Different time zones and all that. [more firmly] Pretty boring stuff really. [mumbling] Just spreadsheets and conference calls, nothing worth discussing over fences.
Character A: [persistent tone] Consulting! How interesting! [speeding up] My nephew does consulting too—maybe you know him? [hopeful] He works at that big firm downtown. [probing] What kind of clients do you work with exactly?
778 
Character B: [uncomfortable laugh] Various companies, nothing specific. [defensive] Look, I really should get back inside. [softly] Got a call starting soon. [more hurried] Those time zones wait for no one, right?
Character A: [disappointed] Oh, of course! [brightening quickly] But wait—are you married? [gossipy whisper] I thought I saw someone through your kitchen window yesterday. [normally] My book club meets Thursdays if you're interested!
779 
Character B: [sharp exhale] That was just... the TV probably. [flatly] I live alone. [forcing politeness] Book club sounds... nice, but I'm not much of a reader. [awkward pause] More of a documentary person.
Character A: [surprised] Documentaries! [slower, intrigued] About what exactly? [quick giggle] True crime? I love those murder shows! [enthusiastically] Did you see the one about that woman who disappeared from this very neighborhood?
780 
Character B: [nervously] No, I hadn't heard. [stilted] I prefer nature documentaries actually. [dry laugh] Birds and... trees. [more firmly] Very calming after long work days. Nothing dramatic or mysterious about migration patterns.
Character A: [skeptically] Birds and trees, how peaceful. [probing again] You know, you look so familiar! [thoughtful humming] Have you ever lived here before? [faster] Maybe visited someone? My memory for faces is excellent!
781 
Character B: [tense] Never been here before, no. [forced casual tone] Must have one of those common faces. [nervous laughter] People say that all the time. [quietly insistent] Really need to go now though.
Character A: [calling out] Oh wait! [sweetly] I'm having a barbecue Saturday! [coaxing tone] Everyone from the street will be there! [singsongy] You simply must come—we're all dying to meet you properly!
782 
Character B: [hesitant] That's very kind but... [weakly] I might be traveling for work. [unconvincingly] Big project deadline coming up. [soft sigh] Rain check maybe? I'm not great at parties anyway.
Character A: [deflated] Oh, that's a shame. [perking up] But if plans change! [meaningfully slower] We always know when someone's home—thin walls in these houses! [bright laugh] The Johnsons learned that the hard way!
783 
Character B: [uneasily] Right, the Johnson incident you mentioned. [strained politeness] Well, I'll keep the noise down. [hurried whisper] Really going now. [louder] Nice meeting you Barbara. Enjoy your afternoon.
Character A: [quickly interjecting] Just one more thing! [urgent curiosity] Do you need any recommendations? [rattling off] Plumbers, electricians, doctors? [slower, pointed] The police station is just five minutes away—very responsive, wonderful people!
784 
Character B: [curtly] I'm all set, thanks. [defensive edge] Everything's perfectly fine. [forced smile in voice] Google's pretty helpful these days. [firmly] Goodbye Barbara. I'm sure we'll talk again... sometime.
Character A: [chirping] Oh definitely! [louder enthusiasm] I'm always around! [confiding tone] Work from home, you see—retired early! [cheerful shout] Welcome to the neighborhood! I'll bring cookies once you're settled!
785 
Character B: [resigned sigh] Cookies. Great. [muttering] Can't wait. [falsely bright] Thanks so much, Barbara. [fading volume] See you around. Or through the fence. Or window apparently. [nervous chuckle] Bye now.

Script: 12a71ea6 | Role: Customer Support

786 Customer Support: Lottery Commission Tax Department, this is Marcus speaking. May I have your ticket validation number to assist you today?Customer: Oh my God, yes, I just—I can't believe this—it's W-I-N-3-3-7-9-2-K. I won ten million dollars yesterday and nobody told me about the taxes!787 Customer Support: Congratulations on your win, ticket number WIN33792K confirmed. Federal withholding is automatically twenty-four percent, so that's two point four million right off the top.Customer: Two point four MILLION? But wait, that's not—someone said something about thirty-seven percent—is there more?788 Customer Support: Correct, the federal tax rate for this income bracket is thirty-seven percent total. You'll owe an additional thirteen percent when you file, that's another one point three million.Customer: So I'm not even getting—hold on, I'm doing the math—that's only like six point three million left? What about my state, I'm in zip code 9-4-1-0-8.789 Customer Support: California zip 94108, yes. State tax adds another thirteen point three percent, approximately one point three three million, bringing your net to roughly five million.Customer: Five million from ten million—that's HALF my money gone! Can I, I don't know, spread it out over years or something to pay less?790 Customer Support: You can choose annuity payments over thirty years using form L-T-R-Y-4-5-6-A. That reduces the tax burden slightly but decreases the total payout to about seven million pre-tax.Customer: Wait, it goes from ten million to seven million if I take payments? But then—then I still pay taxes on the seven million?791 Customer Support: Correct, taxes apply to each annual payment of approximately two hundred thirty-three thousand. Would you like me to email the comparison worksheet to your registered account?Customer: Yes, please, my email is the one on file—uh, ending in at gmail. Also, who do I even write these tax checks to?792 Customer Support: The IRS receives federal withholding electronically under reference number F-E-D-9-9-2-1-7-3. California gets theirs through account number C-A-L-5-5-8-X.Customer: Do I need a special tax person for this? Because my regular guy just does, you know, normal W-2s and maybe a 1099 here and there.793 Customer Support: I strongly recommend a CPA specializing in windfall income. We provide a referral list in information packet P-K-G-7-7-2, which I'm including with your email.Customer: Okay, okay, one more thing—if I donate some to charity, does that help? Like, can I get under that thirty-seven percent bracket somehow?794 Customer Support: Charitable deductions can reduce taxable income but won't change your bracket with this amount. Maximum deduction is typically sixty percent of adjusted gross income annually.Customer: So basically no matter what I do, the government's getting five million dollars of my ten million dollar win? This is just—this is insane!795 Customer Support: I understand it's frustrating, but these are federal and state requirements. Your case number is T-A-X-9-9-4-4-2 if you need further assistance.Customer: Yeah, alright, I'll—I'll look at that packet you're sending. Thanks for explaining everything, even though it's completely crushing my dreams right now.
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

796 [Disappointed] So, um, I talked to Sarah and she told me a completely different story about what happened that night. [Slow] Wanna explain that? [Angry] [Shout] Don't you dare try to turn this around on me—you lied straight to my face! [Sad] I keep thinking about all the times I defended you to other people, and now I just feel so... stupid, y'know? [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Oh wow, real original excuse there—let me guess, it was for my own good, right? [Tsk] [Whisper] Everyone in the room knew except me, didn't they? [Slow] That's what hurts the most, honestly. [Fast] Wait wait wait, so you're telling me that literally everything about that weekend was just—it was all made up? [Disappointed] [Happy] You know what's actually kinda funny? [Laugh] I was gonna lie to cover for you before I found out you'd been playing me this whole time! [Angry] The thing is—no, actually, forget it, I don't even wanna hear whatever excuse you've cooked up. [Groan] [Slow] How long, exactly? [Sad] [Sigh] Like, how long have you been keeping this from me? [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] I mean, congratulations, you really had me fooled there for, what, three whole years? [Fast] [Angry] I literally rearranged my entire schedule because you said you needed—and it wasn't even real?! [Disappointed] You could've just... I dunno, trusted me with the truth maybe? [Tsk] [Slow] But I guess that was too much to ask. [Whisper] [Sad] My mom warned me about this, about you, and I didn't listen. [Happy] Honestly? Part of me is almost impressed you kept it going this long! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Real dedication to the craft there, buddy. [Shout] [Angry] Get out—just get out of my apartment right now! [Fast] We'll talk when I've calmed down, if we talk at all! [Slow] So basically, um, what you're saying is our entire friendship was built on—on what, exactly? [Disappointed] [Sigh] [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh sure, crying now, that's great—really gonna make me forget about the lying thing, definitely. [Sad] I would've helped you, y'know? [Whisper] If you'd just asked, I would've done anything for you. [Angry] [Groan] This is exactly like that time with Marcus, except—actually no, this is worse, this is so much worse. [Chuckle] You're kinda doing that thing with your eye that you always do when you're nervous. [Slow] [Disappointed] At least now I know what it means.1239 [Slow] Okay, so if I just, um, if I stare at the board long enough, maybe—maybe something will actually stick. [Sigh] [Whisper] [Fast] Did he seriously just repeat the same point for the third time, or am I going insane here? [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another PowerPoint slide with, like, fifty bullet points that he's gonna read word for word. [Tsk] Fantastic. [Disappointed] I actually thought this class would be—I dunno, interesting? [Sigh] But here we are, forty minutes into nothing. [Happy] Wait, only ten minutes left? [Chuckle] I can totally survive ten more minutes of this! [Angry] [Whisper] My phone's been dead for an hour and I'm just—I'm literally dying here, okay? [Slow] The way his voice just kinda... drones... on and on... it's actually hypnotic, y'know? [Yawn] [Fast] Coffee, I need coffee, or sugar, or literally anything to keep my eyes—wait, did I just miss something important? [Groan] [Sad] I paid, um, I paid hundreds of dollars to sit here and learn absolutely nothing. [Sigh] Maybe if I write really, really detailed notes, it'll look like I'm—oh who am I kidding, I'm drawing stick figures. [Chuckle] [Shout] What? [Fast] Sorry, I just—you asked me something and I completely zoned out! [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's discuss the theoretical implications of something that literally nobody in this room cares about. [Whisper] Psst, what page are we even on? I've been, uh, I've been somewhere else mentally for like twenty minutes. [Tsk] [Disappointed] [Fast] This is exactly why I shouldn't take morning classes—my brain's not even functioning yet and he's talking about quantum whatever. [Happy] Oh my god, is he actually wrapping up early? [Laugh] This never happens! [Angry] I swear if he says "furthermore" one more time, I'm gonna—I'm just gonna walk out, honestly. [Groan] Focus, focus, focus... okay so basically he's saying—nope, lost it again, completely gone. [Sigh] [Disappointed] [Slow] [Sad] Everyone else looks so engaged and I'm just here wondering if, like, if lunch is still being served at the cafeteria. [Whisper] [Sarcastic] Wow, another "fascinating" anecdote from 1987 that has literally nothing to do with our exam. [Fast] Wait wait wait, he just said that's gonna be on the test? [Angry] I haven't been listening for the past hour! [Groan]--- MONOLOGUE ---

SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a thing they said to be polite, then realizing it was taken literally, then dreading the follow-through expected of them, spiraling into politeness trap regret
==================================================

[casual]
So I, uh, I ran into Mrs. Chen from down the hall today at the mailboxes. You know, the, um, the sweet old lady with the— with the little dog? And she's like struggling with all these, uh, these grocery bags, right?

[conversational]
So I'm like, "Oh, Mrs. Chen, let me know if you ever need help with groceries or anything!" Just being, you know, neighborly. Like, um, like a normal person would say, right? I mean, it's just— it's just what you say.

[slight concern]
But then she gets this, um, this really grateful look and she's like, "Oh thank you, dear, that's so kind!" And I'm thinking, okay, cool, good deed done, you know? Made her, uh, made her day a little brighter or whatever.

[worry creeping in]
But now I'm thinking about it and, um, and she seemed really— like really relieved? Like she was actually— [nervous laugh] like she was actually planning to, uh, to take me up on that?

[growing anxiety]
Oh god, what if she— what if she actually calls me? I don't even know her number but she could just, um, just knock on my door with like a whole grocery list and— [groan] and I can't say no now because I literally— I literally offered!

[spiraling]
I'm gonna be doing her shopping every week! For like, uh, for the rest of my life! All because I— because I can't just mind my own— [frustrated sigh] why do I say things?!

799 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: b0716afb

SCENARIO: Casually talking about a suspicious link they clicked, then checking their accounts, then seeing unusual activity, ending in phishing realization horror
==================================================

[casual]
So, um, I got this email earlier from what I thought was, uh, my bank? And it was like, "urgent security alert" or whatever, so I— I clicked the link because, you know, I don't want my, um, my account to get frozen or anything.

[conversational]
The website looked, um, it looked totally normal, like— I mean I've seen their login page a million times, right? So I put in my, uh, my username and password, and it just, um, it said "processing" for like forever and then— then nothing happened.

[slight concern]
Which was, um, which was weird, but I figured maybe their site was just, uh, being slow or whatever. But then I started thinking about it and I'm like, wait, when did they— when did they even send that? So I, um, I decided to just double-check my accounts real quick.

[growing worry]
And I'm logging into my actual bank account now and— oh. Oh wait. There's, um, there's a charge here I don't recognize. Like a fifty dollar thing to some— some company I've never heard of. And it's from, uh, it's from today.

[alarm building]
Hold on, let me— [sharp exhale] Oh my god. There's more. There's like three different charges and I— I didn't buy any of this stuff! What the hell is—

[panic/horror]
Oh no. Oh no no no. The email wasn't— it wasn't from my bank at all, was it? I just— [groan] I just gave them everything! My login, my— oh my god, I'm so stupid! They're in my account right now!
