Script: 6831dd45_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: It's done. We signed everything this morning.
443 
Character 2: Oh my god, wait—you actually, you actually did it? The partnership's like, official official? I can't believe—no wait, I can believe it because you've been working on this for literally months but still!
Character 1: Yeah. Five months of negotiations. Finally over.
444 
Character 2: Okay okay, but like—how do you feel? Because I mean, this is huge, right? You're basically running a whole company now with—what's his name again, Marcus?
Character 1: Martin. And I don't know how I feel yet.
445 
Character 2: Martin, right right. Sorry, I'm just— I'm so pumped for you! But also like, I get it if you're kinda overwhelmed? That's totally normal, y'know?
Character 1: Overwhelmed. That's one word for it.
446 
Character 2: Uh oh, that's—wait, that doesn't sound good. Are you having second thoughts? Because like, if something feels off, you should definitely trust your gut on this one.
Character 1: No second thoughts. Just... it's real now. No going back.
447 
Character 2: Yeah, that's—wow, that's gotta be terrifying honestly. Like the good kind of terrifying but still terrifying. Have you told your family yet?
Character 1: My mom keeps calling. I haven't picked up.
448 
Character 2: Oh no no no, you can't—I mean, you can, obviously, but she's gonna freak out when she finds out! In like, the best way though. She's been rooting for this since day one, right?
Character 1: She has opinions about everything. I need a minute first.
449 
Character 2: That's so fair, actually. You literally just signed your life away—I mean, not away, but like, you know what I mean. You deserve to just... process, y'know?
Character 1: Signed my life away. Accurate.
450 
Character 2: Wait wait wait, I didn't mean—okay, are you sure you're okay? Because you're being extra... I dunno, extra you right now, which usually means something's up.
Character 1: I'm fine. Just tired. And now I have a business partner who texts at 5 AM.
451 
Character 2: Five—are you kidding me? That's actually criminal. Like, boundaries are gonna be so important here, you know that right? You can't let him just—
Character 1: Too late. Already got three texts about marketing strategies during breakfast.
452 
Character 2: Oh my god, he's one of those. Okay okay, we're gonna—actually, you know what? Let's get drinks. Celebrate properly and also maybe, like, strategize how to train Martin not to be a morning person psycho.
Script: 459e0b6f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Finally finished that bookshelf.
453 
Character 2: Wait wait wait—you actually finished it? The one you've been working on for like, what, three months? Oh my god, I need to see this immediately!
Character 1: It's in the living room.
454 
Character 2: Okay but like—can we talk about how you literally taught yourself woodworking from YouTube? That's... I mean, that's kind of incredible, right? Most people can't even assemble IKEA furniture.
Character 1: IKEA's harder. No joke.
455 
Character 2: Stop it! But seriously, how does it feel? Because I remember you being all "I don't know if I can do this" and now you're just—you built actual furniture!
Character 1: Feels good. Sturdy too.
456 
Character 2: Sturdy? That's—that's what you're going with? Come on! You gotta be at least a little bit proud of yourself. Like, this is huge!
Character 1: Maybe a little.
457 
Character 2: A little? Okay okay, I see you trying to play it cool but like—did you use those fancy joints you were obsessing over? The um... the dovetail thingies?
Character 1: Mortise and tenon. But yeah, dovetails on the drawers.
458 
Character 2: See! See, that's what I'm talking about! You're using words I don't even understand. God, I can barely hang a picture frame straight and you're over here becoming a master craftsman.
Character 1: Hardly. Made plenty of mistakes.
459 
Character 2: Oh no no no, we're not doing that. We're not gonna minimize this, okay? Because honestly? Making mistakes and still ending up with something amazing is like—that's the whole point, right?
Character 1: The wood grain turned out nice.
460 
Character 2: The wood grain! Yes! Tell me more about that because you were so stressed about picking the right wood. Was it—what was it again? Oak?
Character 1: Walnut. Cost a fortune.
461 
Character 2: Walnut's gorgeous though! And like, you know what? Sometimes you gotta invest in the good stuff. Especially when you're literally creating an heirloom piece. This is gonna last forever.
Character 1: If it doesn't collapse first.
462 
Character 2: Oh my god, stop! It's not gonna—you know it's perfect. I bet you've been testing every shelf with like, encyclopedias or whatever just to make sure. Am I right or am I right?

SCENARIO: a patient named David hears the word "remission"
==================================================

[confused, processing]
Wait, so, um— remission? That's, uh, that's good, right? I mean, that's— that has to be good. The doctor said remission and then she was, like, smiling, so that's— [exhale] okay, that's definitely good.

[muttering to self]
But like, what does that actually— I mean, I know what it means, but, um, does that mean it's gone? Or does it mean it's just, like, sleeping? Because I feel like there's a difference there and I should probably— I should probably know the difference.

[slightly anxious]
God, I should have asked more questions. I just sat there like, "Oh, okay, cool," but now I'm like— now I'm thinking, wait, is this temporary? Is it— how long does remission last? [nervous laugh] I literally have no idea.

[brightening slightly]
But she seemed happy about it, the doctor. She seemed, um, she seemed really pleased, actually. So that's— that has to mean something good, right? I mean, doctors don't get excited about, uh, about bad news.

[trailing off, uncertain]
I should probably call Mom. Or maybe I should, um, maybe I should Google it first? Just to make sure I understand what I'm— what I'm even telling her...

SCENARIO: a soldier named Marcus reunites with his family in Ohio after deployment
==================================================

[muttering to himself]
Okay, so, um, I should probably call ahead, right? Like, I should— I should let them know I'm, uh, I'm almost there? But then again, Mom said she'd be home all day, and, um, and it's only like twenty minutes from the airport, so—

[slightly anxious]
Wait, what if they're not— what if they went out? I mean, I told them the flight time, but you know how Dad is with, uh, with keeping track of stuff like that. [nervous laugh] He probably wrote it down somewhere and then, um, then lost the paper or whatever.

[working through it]
But I texted Mom from the layover, so she knows I'm— she knows I'm coming today. Right? Yeah, I definitely— I definitely sent that text. I think. [pause] Let me just, um, let me just drive there and see what happens.

[quieter, more reflective]
It's been eight months. Eight months of, uh, of thinking about this moment, and now I'm like, nervous? Which is stupid because it's just— it's just my family, you know?

[brightening]
Okay, whatever. They're gonna lose their minds when they see me. Mom's probably gonna cry. Dad'll pretend he's not emotional and then, um, then hug me for like five minutes straight. [soft laugh] Yeah. Yeah, this is good.

SCENARIO: noticing the person next to them on the plane is a talker
==================================================

[muttering]
Oh no. Oh, um, oh no no no. He's— he's looking at me. The guy next to me is, like, he's got that look. That, uh, that "I'm about to start a conversation" look and I just— [sigh] I just wanted to, um, to read my book and maybe take a nap, you know?

[slightly panicked]
Okay, so maybe if I just— if I just put my headphones in really obviously, like, really obvious about it, then he'll— he'll get the hint, right? That's, um, that's the universal "please don't talk to me" signal on airplanes, I think.

[resigned]
And he's talking. Great. [exhale] He's telling me about his— his connecting flight situation and I'm nodding like I, um, like I care about Atlanta airport delays. Which I don't. I mean, I'm trying to be polite but—

[under breath]
Oh god, now he's asking about my book. "What are you reading?" Like, dude, I would be reading it if you weren't— [nervous laugh] okay, okay, just smile and give short answers. Maybe he'll run out of, um, of steam eventually.

[hopeful but doubtful]
Or maybe he's just being friendly and it'll die down once we, uh, once we take off? People usually get quiet during takeoff, right? Right? [pause] ...Right?

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 8cf2a140 | Role: Character B

Character A: [breathless] We made it, Sarah. [voice breaking] The summit of K2. [Choking sob] After everything, after losing Marcus and Chen, we actually made it to the top of this goddamn mountain.
466 
Character B: [trembling whisper] Don't say their names. [louder] Not yet. [Gasping breath] I keep thinking I'll turn around and see Marcus grinning behind us with that stupid joke ready about altitude sickness.
Character A: [bitter laugh] He would've loved this view. [quieter] Remember how he used to say the mountain chooses who stays? [voice cracking] I guess it chose us to carry their memory up here instead.
467 
Character B: [angrily] The mountain didn't choose anything! [softer now] The avalanche took them. [Long exhale] We're standing on their dream right now, breathing air they'll never taste again at twenty-eight thousand feet.
Character A: [hollow tone] I can't even celebrate. Every photo we take, every flag we plant—[more desperately] it feels like betrayal. [Shuddering breath] How do we go home and tell their families we made it without them?
468 
Character B: [firmly] We tell them the truth. [voice wavering] That Chen saved my life with that rope. [almost inaudible] That Marcus pushed you out of the avalanche path. They died as heroes, not victims, you understand?
Character A: [through tears] Heroes. [sarcastically] Right. [Broken whisper] Heroes who froze to death while we kept climbing. I haven't slept since we left them—their faces keep appearing in the ice formations around me.
469 
Character B: [defensive shout] We couldn't carry them! [pleading] You know we couldn't. [Ragged breathing] The weather window was closing, and staying meant we'd all die. Marcus would've pushed us forward himself—you know that.
Character A: [numbly] My fingers are frostbitten. [with sudden intensity] Look at them—black like the void that swallowed our friends. [Hysterical laugh] Maybe it's the mountain's way of making sure I never forget what reaching paradise cost us.
470 
Character B: [gentle but firm] Stop torturing yourself. [more forcefully] They knew the risks! [Controlled breath] Every mountaineer who attempts K2 writes their will first. Chen made me promise to summit if anything happened to him.
Character A: [accusingly] You promised Chen? [voice rising] When? During those last moments while he was slipping away, or before, when we all pretended this wouldn't happen? [Bitter chuckle] Promises to dead men are just guilt dressed prettier.
471 
Character B: [hurt] That's not fair. [steadier] He made me promise at base camp, actually. Said his daughter should know her father's friends were strong enough to finish what they started together. [voice catching] Strong enough.
Character A: [exhausted whisper] I'm not strong. [slightly louder] I'm empty, Sarah. [Weeping] Standing on top of the world should feel like something, but all I feel is the weight of two ghosts on my shoulders.
472 
Character B: [raw emotion] Then we carry them down. [more determined] Every step back to base camp, we carry their memory. [Sharp intake] Their families deserve to know they made it here through us, even if—
Character A: [interrupting loudly] Even if what? [quieter now] Even if we left them buried under tons of ice? [Sob] God, I can still hear Marcus screaming my name before the silence hit us like death itself.
473 
Character B: [shaking] I hear Chen too. [firmly] Every night. [voice dropping] But standing here means their struggle meant something. This summit belongs to all four of us, not just the two still breathing this thin air.
Character A: [resigned] You're right. [stronger] You're right. [Deep breath] We should take their photos out, place them here at the summit marker. Let them see what they died trying to reach—one last moment together.
474 
Character B: [crying freely] Yes. Here, I have Chen's. [reverent whisper] His wife gave it to me. [steadying] Marcus's too—his sister insisted I carry it. Look how young they were in these pictures, before mountains called them.
Character A: [wonderingly] The sun's breaking through. [emotional] Right as we placed their photos. [Choked laugh] Marcus always did have perfect timing. Maybe they're telling us it's okay, that we did what we had to do up here.
475 
Character B: [peaceful exhaustion] Time to go down. [with finality] We've got stories to tell and promises to keep. [Quiet sob] But first, let's sit here for just one more minute—all four of us, together at the top.
Script: f872d31e | Role: Character B

Character A: [shaking voice] She always said the desert would claim her one day. [Bitter laugh] Guess she was right about that, [quieter] just didn't think it'd be so soon. The sand takes everything eventually, doesn't it, partner?
476 
Character B: [hoarse whisper] Twenty years riding together, Jake. [Steadier] Twenty goddamn years through dust storms and gunfights, [voice breaking] and it's a rattler that gets her. [Choked sob] Should've watched where she was stepping, should've seen it first.
Character A: [angrily] Don't you dare blame yourself! [Softer now] Martha wouldn't want that. [Deep sigh] Remember how she'd laugh at us when we got all serious? Said we looked like prairie dogs trying to do arithmetic.
477 
Character B: [weak chuckle] Yeah, she had that way about her. [Growing emotional] Could out-ride, out-shoot, and out-drink both of us combined. [Trembling] My hands won't stop shaking, Jake. Can't even hold this shovel steady anymore.
Character A: [firmly] Here, let me take over for a spell. [Gentler tone] You carved that cross real nice, Sam. [voice cracking] She'd appreciate the effort, even though she always said markers were for folks who stayed put.
478 
Character B: [desperately] What are we supposed to do now? [Quieter] Can't imagine riding into another town without her between us, [faster speech] keeping us from killing each other over stupid things. She was the glue, Jake.
Character A: [long exhale] We keep going, that's what. [Determined] We take that gold she helped us find to her sister in California, [wavering] just like we promised. [Grunt] Though Lord knows how we'll explain this to Sarah.
479 
Character B: [bitterly] Sarah never understood why Martha chose this life anyway. [Slower pace] City folk don't get it—the freedom, the stars, [voice rising] the way the horizon calls your name every damn morning until you answer.
Character A: [nostalgic tone] Remember that time in Tucson? [Laughing sadly] Martha convinced that whole saloon she was a traveling preacher's wife. [More quietly] Had them all singing hymns while we robbed the poker game upstairs.
480 
Character B: [sudden laugh] Lord almighty, I forgot about that! [Slowing down] She wore that ridiculous bonnet, kept calling us her "wayward brothers in need of salvation." [Sniffling] Best con we ever pulled, and the most fun too.
Character A: [gravelly voice] Sun's getting low, Sam. [More urgent] We should say some words before the coyotes start their singing. Martha deserved better than two broken cowboys and a shallow grave, [whispered] but it's all we got.
481 
Character B: [clearing throat] She didn't need fancy things though. [Stronger] Remember what she said about churches and proper funerals? [Quoting voice] "When I go, just point me toward the sunset and let me ride." That's what she wanted.
Character A: [thoughtfully] You still got that harmonica she gave you? [Hopeful tone] Maybe we could play that tune she loved, [voice fading] the one about the lonesome dove. Seems fitting for a goodbye, don't you think?
482 
Character B: [rustling sounds] Yeah, I got it here. [Shaky breath] Haven't played since Amarillo, fingers might not remember how. [Determined whisper] But for Martha, I'll make these old hands work one more time, I swear it.
Character A: [reverently] That's beautiful, Sam. [Voice thickening] She's probably up there laughing at us, two grown men crying in the dirt. [Soft chuckle] But she's also probably touched we care this much. Always underestimated how much we loved her.
483 
Character B: [defensive tone] Nothing wrong with tears, Jake. [Firmly] Even cowboys got the right to grieve. [Breaking down] She was family, the only real family either of us had since we started running from our pasts.
Character A: [steadying voice] Come on, help me move this rock over the grave. [Strained] It'll keep the animals away. [Gentler] We'll come back someday, when things are settled, maybe bring some wildflowers like she always picked for the horses.
484 
Character B: [resigned] If we make it that long. [Darker tone] Trail to California's full of men who'd love to collect our bounties. [Sighing] Without Martha watching our backs, odds ain't exactly in our favor anymore, partner.
Character A: [fiercely] Then we'll die trying to keep our promise! [Quieter intensity] Martha didn't survive this long for us to give up now. [Measured words] We owe her that much—to finish what the three of us started together.
485 
Character B: [with resolve] You're right, Jake. [Building strength] We'll ride for California at first light, deliver that gold to Sarah. [Emotional whisper] And we'll tell her that Martha died free, under the biggest sky God ever made. [Pause] That's something.
Script: bcc6d290 | Role: Character B

Character A: [trembling voice] Oh Martha, listen to them! [Sniffling] Their little voices singing together like that—it's just too precious. [quieter] Remember when we used to dream about days like this?
486 
Character B: [through tears] I know, Helen. [shaky breath] Look at my grandson's face, so serious about getting the words right! [warmer tone] And your granddaughter conducting them like she's leading an orchestra.
Character A: [Laughing sob] She gets that from her mother! [nostalgic whisper] Sixty-five years we've been alive, and nothing—absolutely nothing—beats this moment. [voice breaking] My heart feels like it might burst from all this joy.
487 
Character B: [soft and wobbly] The cake they made is lopsided, [Gentle chuckle], frosting everywhere. [more emotionally] But it's the most beautiful cake I've ever seen because their tiny hands made it with such love.
Character A: [high pitched] Wait, are they doing harmonies now? [Gasping breath] Martha, they practiced harmonies for us! [cracking voice] I can't handle this—pass me another tissue before I completely fall apart here.
488 
Character B: [whispered awe] They must have rehearsed for weeks. [stronger] Your son just told me they wanted it perfect for their "special grandmas." [Soft sob] How did we get so lucky to have these angels?
Character A: [rapidly speaking] Remember our birthdays as kids? [slower, sadder] Just a simple cake if we were lucky. [brightening up] Now look—we're queens for a day, and our grandchildren are our royal choir!
489 
Character B: [thick with emotion] Every wrinkle, every gray hair, [Shuddering breath], every ache was worth it to reach this day. [steadier] These babies are singing their hearts out like we're the most important people alive.
Character A: [barely audible] Oh no, here comes the big finish. [building volume] They're getting louder and—Martha, [Weeping laugh] Tommy just shouted "happy birthday" at the top of his lungs! That precious boy!
490 
Character B: [choked up] And there's Sarah doing her little curtsy! [more controlled] We should probably stop crying before we scare them. [breaking again] But how can we when they're being so absolutely perfect right now?
Character A: [determined tone] Let them see us cry happy tears. [gentler] It's good for children to know they can bring such joy. [voice wavering] Oh Martha, they're running over for hugs—brace yourself!
491 
Character B: [joyful shriek] Here they come! [laughing] Like a stampede of love heading straight for us. [tenderly] Sixty-five never felt so young as when these little arms wrap around us tight.
Character A: [muffled voice] Best birthday ever, don't you think? [Hiccupping laugh] Even better than when Harold proposed at my twenty-first! [dreamily] These grandbabies have given us something no gift could ever match today.
492 
Character B: [firmly] Nothing compares to this. [quieting down] Not the cruise, not the jewelry over the years. [passionate whisper] Just their voices, their effort, their pure love singing happy birthday to two old ladies.
Character A: [mock scolding] Old ladies? [brighter] Speak for yourself—we're vintage! [Snorting laugh] But yes, Martha, this tops everything, even that surprise party the kids threw us five years ago downtown.
493 
Character B: [reflective tone] You know what Helen? [building enthusiasm] We should record them next year, capture these precious voices before they change. [softer] Although nothing could capture how full my heart feels right now.
Character A: [excited squeal] Oh, they want us to blow out candles together! [nervous giggle] At our age, we might need their help! [warmly] Come here, sweet ones, help your grandmas make a wish.
494 
Character B: [contemplative] What could we possibly wish for? [Contented sigh] We have everything right here in this room. [more animated] These grandchildren, this friendship, this perfect moment that I'll treasure forever and always.
Character A: [instructing gently] On three, everyone! [louder] One, two— [Whooping] Wait, little Emma's already blowing! [chuckling] Let her have her moment; there's enough magic in this day for all of us.
495 
Character B: [peacefully] Look at them clapping and cheering. [voice thick] Helen, promise me something—we'll make it to seventy so we can do this again. [stronger] These babies deserve many more years of their grandmas.

496 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, thank you for calling. [speaking quickly] I see here you're calling about a payment posting issue—let me pull up your account real quick. [reassuring] How can I help you today?Customer: [frustrated] Yeah, I made a payment two weeks ago and it's still not showing. [voice breaking] I'm getting late fees even though I paid on time—this is the third time this has happened. [desperately] I really can't afford these extra charges.497 Customer Support: [apologetically] I understand your frustration, let me check that for you. [quickly] Can you tell me the exact date and amount of the payment, and uh, what method did you use to pay?Customer: [exhausted] October fifteenth, three hundred and twenty-two dollars. [slower] I paid through your website like I always do, and I have the confirmation email. [bitterly] But somehow it never seems to matter when I have proof.498 Customer Support: [more firmly] I see the payment here, actually it was applied but—[hesitant] well, it looks like it went to the wrong account segment. [rapidly] Let me fix that right now and reverse those late fees for you.Customer: [sighs deeply] The wrong account segment? [incredulous] How does that even happen when I only have one loan with you? [voice rising] This keeps happening and nobody can explain why!499 Customer Support: [calmly] You're absolutely right to be upset. [speaking faster] Sometimes our system splits principal and interest into different segments and if the payment isn't coded properly it—[trails off] Let me just get this corrected immediately.Customer: [sarcastically] Oh great, so it's a system issue. [tired] Every month I have to call, every month it's something different. [pleading] Can't you just make it so my payments go where they're supposed to?500 Customer Support: [more reassuring] I'm putting a note on your account right now to prevent this. [quickly] Also, I'm crediting back forty-five dollars in late fees and, um, adjusting the payment date. [confidently] This should be fully resolved in twenty-four hours.Customer: [skeptically] Twenty-four hours, right. [sighs] That's what they said last time and I waited a week. [firmly] I need something in writing that shows this has been fixed.501 Customer Support: [briskly] Absolutely, I'm sending you an email confirmation right now with a case number. [speaking rapidly] The reference number is seven-seven-four-three-two, and my name is Derek if you need to follow up. [reassuring] Is that helpful?Customer: [slightly calmer] Okay, Derek, I appreciate that. [cautiously] But what happens next month when I make my payment? [worried] I can't keep taking time off work to call about this.502 Customer Support: [confidently] I've set up your account with automatic posting rules so this won't happen again. [more slowly] Every payment will now automatically allocate correctly between principal and interest. [quickly] No more manual processing needed.Customer: [relieved] Finally, someone who actually fixes things. [chuckles weakly] You know, Derek, you're the first person who hasn't just told me to wait and see. [gratefully] Thank you for actually listening.503 Customer Support: [warmly] That's what I'm here for, truly. [speaking quickly] I also see you've been a customer for six years—we should have caught this issue much sooner. [apologetically] I'm really sorry about the hassle.Customer: [sighs] Six years of mostly problems, yeah. [quietly] But if this actually fixes it, maybe I won't have to refinance elsewhere. [hopefully] I just want my payments to work like they're supposed to.504 Customer Support: [reassuringly] They will from now on, I promise you that. [rapidly] I'm also adding a courtesy credit of twenty dollars to your account for the inconvenience, and um, waiving next month's service fee.Customer: [surprised] Oh, I wasn't expecting that. [more warmly] That actually helps a lot, especially with the holidays coming up. [relieved] Maybe you guys aren't so bad after all.505 Customer Support: [cheerfully] We try our best, even when our systems don't. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help you with today while I have your account pulled up? [helpfully] Any other concerns?Customer: [exhausted but satisfied] No, I think—I think we're good for now. [gratefully] Thanks again Derek, you've been more helpful than the last five people combined. [sighs] Have a good rest of your day.

506 Customer Support: Hello, VacBot support, agent ID R-7-7-3 speaking. Can I have your device serial number to access your account?Customer: Oh, um, yeah—it's on the bottom here—S-V-C dash 8-8-4-2-1-9-A. The thing keeps, like, bumping into walls it should already know about.507 Customer Support: I've located your RoboVac Pro, serial SVC-884219A. I see you're experiencing mapping issues—when did this start happening?Customer: It was working fine until, I don't know, maybe three days ago? Now it's—wait, hold on—it's literally stuck behind my couch again even though it mapped that area last week.508 Customer Support: I'm pulling up your last successful map sync from November 2nd, reference code M-A-P dash 7-7-9-1. Have you moved any furniture or changed your WiFi settings recently?Customer: No, nothing's moved, everything's the same—oh actually, wait, we did get a new router but that was like two weeks ago. The password is still the same though, so I figured...509 Customer Support: New router hardware can affect mapping connectivity. Let's run diagnostic test D-I-A-G dash 4-4-5 remotely—I need you to press and hold the home button for five seconds.Customer: Okay, holding it now—one, two, three—oh, it beeped twice and the light's flashing orange. Is that, um, is that what's supposed to happen?510 Customer Support: Perfect, that's diagnostic mode. I'm seeing error code E-R-R dash 2-2-8-B indicating corrupted map data—we'll need to perform a factory reset and remap your home.Customer: A complete reset? But I spent like two hours setting up all those no-go zones and—ugh—can't you just, I don't know, fix the existing map somehow?511 Customer Support: Unfortunately corrupted data can't be recovered, but I can email you quick-setup guide Q-S-G dash 1-0-3 to speed up remapping. What's your registered email ending in at gmail?Customer: It's, uh, the one ending in 2-3 at gmail, yeah. So after I reset it, will it remember my cleaning schedules or do I have to redo those too?512 Customer Support: Schedules are stored separately in cloud profile C-P dash 8-8-1-5, so those will automatically restore. Hold both the spot and home buttons simultaneously for ten seconds to initiate reset.Customer: Both buttons, got it—pressing now and—there, it played a little melody and the lights went off. Should I wait for it to restart or what?513 Customer Support: Wait approximately thirty seconds for full restart. You'll see a blue flashing light indicating setup mode, then open your VacBot app version 3.2.1 or higher.Customer: Okay it's—yeah, blue light's flashing now. The app is... let me check... version 3.1.8, so I guess I need to update that first?514 Customer Support: Yes, update required for compatibility. After updating, select "Add New Device" and follow setup wizard W-I-Z dash 9-0-1—the process takes about fifteen minutes.Customer: Alright, updating now—it says two minutes remaining. One more thing though—will this fix the issue where it keeps getting stuck under my kitchen table?515 Customer Support: The new mapping should resolve navigation issues, but if problems persist, contact us with case number C-A-S-E dash 5-5-9-0-2 for advanced troubleshooting. Anything else today?Customer: No, I think—wait actually yes—when I remap, should I pick up all the cables and stuff first, or does it learn to avoid those better if they're already there?

516 [Uncomfortable] Um, wow, that's... that's actually none of your business? [Tsk] Like, who even asks that kind of thing? [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just open up my entire medical history for you, since we're apparently best friends now. [Laugh] [Fast] I don't—wait, did you seriously just ask me that? [Angry] That's so inappropriate I don't even know where to start! [Whisper] My therapist says I don't have to answer questions that make me uncomfortable, so... [Slow] I'm gonna pass on that one. [Happy] You know what's funny? [Chuckle] People always wanna know the juiciest details but never the boring stuff, right? [Disappointed] I thought we were having a nice conversation and then you just—wow, okay. [Sigh] [Slow] That's, uh, that's kinda personal, don't you think? [Tsk] I mean, would you answer that if I asked you? [Shout] Excuse me? [Angry] No, seriously, excuse me—what gives you the right to even go there? [Sad] Why does everyone always have to know about—never mind, I just... [Sigh] I can't do this today. [Fast] Okay so basically that's between me and literally nobody else, thanks. [Sarcastic] But nice try though! [Whisper] Um, can we maybe talk about literally anything else? [Disappointed] This is getting kinda weird, honestly. [Happy] Ha! My mom asks me the same thing and I don't even tell her! [Laugh] [Fast] So good luck with that, buddy. [Slow] I'm gonna pretend you didn't just ask that and we can, like, move on? [Groan] Please? [Sarcastic] Wow, straight for the jugular, huh? [Chuckle] Most people at least buy me dinner first before getting that personal. [Angry] You're really gonna sit there and—actually, you know what? [Shout] None. Of. Your. Business! [Disappointed] I used to think you were cool but that question just... [Slow] yeah, that changed things. [Fast] Oh my god, did you seriously—I can't even—like, who raised you? [Groan] That's so rude! [Sad] That's actually a really painful subject for me, so I'd rather not... [Whisper] if that's okay? [Sarcastic] Sure, and while we're at it, want my social security number too? [Tsk] [Fast] Maybe my banking info? [Happy] You're hilarious! [Laugh] No but seriously, I'm not answering that—nice attempt though, I'll give you points for boldness.959 [Disappointed] I mean, honestly, why am I always the one who has to, like, remember where we parked? [Sigh] It's exhausting. [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just—let me handle everything while you guys have fun. [Tsk] That's totally fair, right? [Fast] Okay so we gotta leave in ten minutes, everybody needs their IDs, and I already called the Uber—wait, where's Marcus? [Groan] [Happy] You know what? I actually kinda like being the mom friend sometimes. [Laugh] Someone's gotta keep you idiots alive! [Whisper] They're all passed out and I'm just sitting here making sure nobody, um, chokes on their own vomit or whatever. [Slow] This is my Friday night. [Angry] I'm not your personal assistant, okay? [Shout] Figure out your own damn ride home for once! [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna be the messy one, y'know? Like, just once let me be the disaster. [Sigh] [Slow] Every single time we go out, it's me who ends up—actually, forget it. [Disappointed] [Tsk] You wouldn't understand anyway. [Fast] [Happy] Wait wait wait, I brought extra phone chargers for everyone! [Chuckle] See? This is why you need me! [Sarcastic] Nobody ever asks if I wanna do shots, but everyone suddenly knows my name when they need a designated driver. [Disappointed] Funny how that works, huh? [Angry] I literally sent fifteen reminders about this deadline and you're just now—are you seriously just now starting? [Groan] Unbelievable. [Whisper] [Sad] I'm so tired of being the only adult in the room, but I can't just... I can't stop, can I? [Chuckle] You guys would basically die without me and we all know it. [Happy] [Fast] Remember last week when nobody brought water to the hike? [Slow] [Disappointed] I guess I'll just, um, cancel my plans again to deal with your emergency. [Sigh] Third time this month. [Shout] How do none of you have the venue address? [Angry] [Fast] The event is literally starting and I'm the only one who knows where we're going! [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh no, please, don't worry about paying me back for those tickets I bought six months ago. [Tsk] I love being everyone's personal bank. [Happy] Actually, being the responsible one means I get to pick the restaurant every time 'cause nobody else makes reservations! [Laugh] [Fast] Silver lining, right? [Sad] Do you guys even notice when I'm not—when I don't show up? [Whisper] Or am I just, like, the human calendar app to you? [Disappointed] I'm twenty-three years old and I'm literally making grocery lists for grown adults who can't feed themselves. [Groan] [Slow] This isn't what I signed up for. [Fast] [Angry] Nobody brought sunscreen, nobody checked the weather, and somehow—somehow I'm the buzzkill for pointing this out? [Sarcastic] Yeah, okay, that makes total sense!--- MONOLOGUE ---

518 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: a4a4cfd0

SCENARIO: Upset about a work presentation going badly, then a colleague sends a supportive message
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, I just— I completely bombed that presentation today. Like completely. I was up until like two AM working on those slides and I get in there and just... [groan] I couldn't get the projector to work, then I'm fumbling around with my notes, and I could see everyone just like— you know when people start checking their phones? Yeah.

[dejected]
And Martinez was there too, which is just— ugh, that's the worst part. Like of course the one time he sits in on something, it's when I'm having a complete meltdown up there. I was supposed to present the quarterly numbers and I'm pretty sure I said "fiscal" when I meant "physical" at one point? I don't even know what that means but—

[bitter]
I just, I worked so hard on that and it didn't matter, none of it mattered because I just— I fell apart. And now everyone probably thinks I'm completely incompetent and—

[surprised]
Oh, wait, I'm getting a— hold on, it's from Sarah.

[softer] [touched]
She says... oh. She says the content was really solid and that tech stuff happens to everyone. And that she learned a lot from my analysis of the third quarter trends?

[warming up] [slightly emotional]
That's... actually really sweet of her to say. God, I was so in my head about it, I didn't even think— maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought?

519 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 37aeea1d

SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly mentioning a funny thing their smart speaker recorded, then checking the history, then finding it's recorded multiple private conversations, ending in privacy horror
==================================================

[casual]
Oh, you're gonna love this. So I'm making coffee this morning and I ask Alexa what the weather's like, right? And she goes, "It's partly cloudy, and by the way, you snore like a freight train." [light laugh] I'm like, what? Apparently it picked up me talking in my sleep or something.

[conversational] [amused]
So I'm curious now, you know? I decide to check the voice history thing to see what other weird stuff it's recorded. Should be harmless, right?

[slight concern]
Except... um, there's a lot more recordings than I expected. Like, way more. I'm scrolling through and there's stuff from when I wasn't even talking to it.

[growing unease]
Wait, here's me on the phone with my mom about Dad's medical stuff. Here's— [sharp exhale] here's me and Jake talking about our relationship problems last week. Private stuff. Really private stuff.

[increasingly alarmed]
Oh my god, it's got everything. Me crying on the phone to my sister. Me complaining about my boss. Me and Jake— [gasp] oh no, intimate conversations, like really intimate.

[panicking] [voice rising]
This thing has been listening to everything! Everything! For months! How much of this got sent to Amazon? Who else has heard this? [frantic] I need to delete this right now. How do I— can I even delete it? Oh god, what if it's backed up somewhere?

520 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: b58ca9ac

SCENARIO: Lightheartedly talking about a gossip they passed along, then tracing it back, then realizing they might be the reason it spread to someone who shouldn't know, spiraling into gossip guilt
==================================================

[casual]
Oh my god, so you know that whole thing with Rachel and the promotion? I may have, uh, accidentally mentioned it to a few people today. [light laugh] Just like casual conversation stuff, you know?

[conversational]
Because honestly, I heard it from Mike, who heard it from someone in HR, so it's not like it was some big secret or anything. And I only told Sarah and... oh, and Jamie from accounting when we were getting coffee.

[a bit concerned]
But then Sarah was like, "Wait, how do you know that?" And I'm thinking back like, okay, Mike told me, but where did Mike hear it? Was it actually from HR or was it from...

[phone buzzes - checking] 
[worried]
Oh no. Oh, this is— Rachel just texted me asking if I know why her boss wants to see her tomorrow morning. [nervous laugh] She sounds really confused and kind of freaked out.

[growing panic]
Wait, wait, wait. If I told Jamie, and Jamie sits right next to Rachel's supervisor... [sharp exhale] Oh god, what if I— what if this gets back to management before Rachel even knows?

[spiraling]
I could have just ruined everything for her! She was supposed to hear about this officially, and now it's gonna look like she's been gossiping about her own promotion! [groan] I'm a terrible person. I'm a terrible, gossipy person who can't keep her mouth shut!
