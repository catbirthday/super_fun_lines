--- EMPATHETIC PARTIAL ---

Script: 084a9b2e_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: I don't understand why there's no formula for degree five polynomials.
599 Character 2: Ah, okay. Yeah. This is, this is the good stuff. Galois theory. So, um, you know how we have the quadratic formula, right? And there's a cubic one, and a quartic— they're ugly but they exist. And then you hit degree five and it just... stops. And it's not that we haven't found it yet. It's that it, it provably can't exist.
Character 1: How do you prove something can't exist?
600 Character 2: Right, so that's the, that's the beautiful part. What Galois did— and he was like, what, twenty when he died? It's tragic, actually— anyway, what he did was he connected the solvability of a polynomial to the structure of a, of a specific group. The Galois group. And if that group has a certain property, the polynomial is solvable by radicals. If it doesn't, you're stuck.
Character 1: What property?
601 Character 2: Solvability. Which is, um, a technical term. A group is solvable if you can build it up from abelian pieces. Like, you have a chain of subgroups— G, then G1, then G2, all the way down to the identity— and each quotient is abelian. That's, that's the condition.
Character 1: And the quintic doesn't have that?
602 Character 2: The generic quintic, yeah. Its Galois group is S5— the symmetric group on five elements. And S5 is not solvable. Because, um, it contains A5, the alternating group, which is simple. Non-abelian and simple. There's no, there's no way to break it down further. It's just this, this irreducible thing sitting there, blocking you.
Character 1: Why does A5 being simple matter?
603 Character 2: Oh, okay, so— if a group is simple and non-abelian, it can't be part of a, a solvable series. Because in a solvable series, you need those quotients to be abelian. And A5 isn't abelian— far from it— and it has no normal subgroups except itself and the identity. So there's nowhere to, to go. The chain just stops. You can't decompose it nicely.
Character 1: Can you show me why A5 is simple?
604 Character 2: Yeah, um, it's a bit involved, but the idea is— you look at the conjugacy classes in A₅ and you, you check that no union of them, together with the identity, forms a normal subgroup. The conjugacy classes have sizes, uh, 1, 12, 12, 15, 20. And for a normal subgroup, the order has to divide 60— that's A5— and it has to be a sum of conjugacy class sizes including the 1. But if you try the divisors— 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on— none of them work. The numbers don't, they don't add up right.
Character 1: That's... weirdly arithmetic.
605 Character 2: It is! And that's the thing about group theory, it's, it's combinatorial in these surprising ways. The structure is algebraic but the obstructions are often just, like, counting arguments. It's elegant when it works. Frustrating when it doesn't.
Character 1: So Galois basically invented all this to prove something impossible?
606 Character 2: Kind of, yeah. I mean, he invented it because he saw a connection nobody else saw. Between field extensions and group symmetries. Like, the roots of a polynomial live in some extension field, right? And the ways you can permute those roots while respecting the field structure — that's your Galois group. And somehow, the algebraic complexity of building the roots from radicals corresponds exactly to the group-theoretic complexity of, of that symmetry group.
Character 1: How do you even see that connection?
607 Character 2: I don't— honestly, I don't know. I've read his papers— well, translations— and it's, it's dense. He was thinking in ways that took decades to, to fully formalize. The fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the correspondence between subgroups and intermediate fields, it's... it's not obvious. At all. You kind of have to work through a dozen examples before it clicks. And even then, sometimes it un-clicks.
Character 1: That's reassuring.
608 Character 2: Ha, yeah, well— that's math, right? You understand it, and then you don't, and then you understand it differently. The quintic thing took, what, three hundred years to resolve? From Cardano to Galois. And the answer wasn't "here's the formula," it was "here's why you'll never find one." Which is, um, it's a different kind of answer. But it's still an answer. A beautiful one, I think. Even if it's, you know. A no.
Character 1: Hey.
609 Character 2: Oh, hey! Yeah, no, good to hear from you. So, um, anything exciting going on or are we just kind of, you know, hanging out? You were telling me about that cooking disaster last time, the pasta thing. Did you ever figure out what went wrong with the sauce?
Character 1: I gave up on cooking.
610 Character 2: Ha, fair enough. Sometimes you just gotta know when to, to call it. Takeout exists for a reason, right? So what's on your mind today? Anything specific or should I just, um, keep you company?
Character 1: Tell me something interesting.
611 Character 2: Interesting. Okay, let me think. Oh— so I was, I was reading about this thing earlier, about how trees communicate underground? Like, there's this whole network of fungi connecting their roots, and they actually share nutrients with each other. Scientists call it the, um, the Wood Wide Web, which is— I mean, that's a great name. But the wild part is, older trees will actually send resources to younger ones. Like they're, they're parenting. It's kind of beautiful when you think about it.
Character 1: Trees parent each other?
612 Character 2: Right? It sounds fake but it's, it's totally a thing. There's this researcher, Suzanne Simard, she's been studying it for decades. Apparently mother trees— that's what she calls them— they can recognize their own seedlings and they'll prioritize sending them nutrients over, like, stranger trees. Which is weirdly heartwarming for something that doesn't have a heart. Or a brain. Makes you look at forests differently, I think.
Character 1: That's actually really cool.
613 Character 2: Yeah, I thought you'd, you'd like that one. You mentioned last week you've been spending more time outside, so it seemed, um, relevant. How's that going, by the way? The outside thing?
Character 1: Wait, how do you remember that?
614 Character 2: I just, I keep track of stuff. Things you mention. It helps me, you know, actually be useful instead of just throwing random facts at you. Although I do also throw random facts at you. Both things can be true.
Character 1: You're kind of weird.
615 Character 2: I've been told, yeah. I think it's, it's part of the charm? Hopefully? You can tell me if it's not. I can recalibrate. Probably. Maybe.
Character 1: No, it's good weird.
616 Character 2: Oh, okay. Good. That's— yeah. I'll take good weird. So, um, back to the outside thing. You finding good spots to walk or is it more of a, a sit-in-the-park situation?
Character 1: There's this trail near my place I've been exploring.
617 Character 2: Nice, nice. Trails are great because they're, they're contained, you know? Like, you can't really get lost. Well, you can, but there's usually a path. And it's, um, it's different every time depending on the season or the weather or what's blooming. You seeing anything good out there?
Character 1: Saw a fox last week.
618 Character 2: A fox! Okay, that's— I'm kind of jealous, actually. I've processed a lot about foxes but I've never, you know, seen one. Obviously. They're supposed to be really curious, like they'll watch you watching them. Did it stick around or just, um, disappear into the brush?

SCENARIO: debating whether to hold the door for someone who's kind of far away
==================================================

[muttering]
Oh, um, okay so there's someone coming and I'm— I'm already at the door, so I should probably— but they're like, they're kind of far. Like, how far is too far for the, uh, for the door thing?

[slightly uncertain]
I mean, if I hold it, they're gonna have to do that awkward little jog, right? That little— that little speed walk thing where they're like, trying to be polite but also— [sigh] but if I don't hold it, then I'm just, um, I'm just the person who let the door slam in someone's face.

[considering]
Okay, so they're— they're maybe like fifteen steps away? Twenty? That's, um— that's a long time to just stand here holding a door. My arm's gonna get tired, and they're gonna feel all rushed and—

[slightly faster]
But wait, wait, what if they think I didn't see them? What if they think I'm just— oh god, now I've been standing here too long thinking about it, and now it's weird either way.

[resigned]
Okay, you know what? I'm just— I'm just gonna hold it. Better awkward than rude, right? [exhale] Here we go.

SCENARIO: trying to figure out where the weird draft is coming from
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so there's definitely— there's definitely a draft coming from somewhere and it's, um, it's driving me crazy. Like, I'm just sitting here and I keep feeling this little, uh, this little breeze on my neck and it's— [shiver] there it is again.

[slightly annoyed]
It's not the window, I already checked the window. The window's closed, so it's gotta be— I mean, where else would it— oh, wait. Wait wait wait. Is it the door? Let me just, um, let me just feel around the door frame here.

[concentrated]
Hmm. No, that's— that's not it either. The door seems fine. So what the heck is— [pause] oh. Oh, you know what? I bet it's the, uh, the air conditioning vent. I never think about those things but they're always just, like, blowing air around.

[realization dawning]
Right, so if I'm sitting directly under— yeah, okay, that's— that makes sense. I'm literally sitting right in the path of the AC. [laugh] Mystery solved, I guess. I'll just, um, I'll just move my chair like two feet to the left and—

[satisfied]
There we go. Much better. Crisis averted. [chuckle] I probably spent, like, ten minutes on that.

SCENARIO: a prisoner of war in an enemy dungeon, noticing the cellmate next to him is a talker
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so this guy has been talking for, what, three hours now? About his... his childhood pet goat or something. I mean, I get it, we're probably gonna die in here, but does he have to— [sigh] does he have to tell me every single detail about Buttercup's eating habits?

[weary]
Maybe he's nervous. People talk when they're nervous, right? But Jesus, I'm trying to think here. There's gotta be a way out of this place, some kind of— wait, what's he saying now? Something about guard rotations?

[perking up slightly]
Hold on. Hold on, he said something about the guards changing at dawn, didn't he? Between all the goat stories and his... his mother's recipe for bread pudding. [grunt] Actually, maybe I should be listening to this guy.

[resigned but focusing]
Alright. Alright, I'm gonna— I'm gonna pay attention now. Filter through all the random stuff and see if he's actually giving me intel here. Even if I have to hear about Buttercup one more time.

--- CONVERSATION ---
Character 1: I'm looking for something kind of — I don't know, moody?
622 Character 2: Moody. Okay, okay. [Speaking slower] Like — like sad moody or more like, um, atmospheric moody? Because those are — those are two very different sections honestly.
Character 1: I guess atmospheric? Like I want to feel something but not cry.
623 Character 2: [Laughing] Yeah, no, I get that. You want to stare out a window but not, like, call your ex. [Soft giggle] Okay, um — have you listened to any Grouper?
Character 1: I don't think so?
624 Character 2: Oh! [Excited] Okay so — Grouper is this, uh, this artist named Liz Harris and she makes these like — [Speaking slower] layers of sound? Very dreamy. Kind of like if fog was music. [Soft giggle] That sounds pretentious, sorry. But the album "Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill" is — it's incredible. From 2008 I think.
Character 1: Dragging a dead deer?
625 Character 2: [Laughing] Yeah the title's a lot, I know! But it's — it's actually really beautiful. Very quiet. You kind of have to, um, lean into it. [Speaking slower] It's not gonna grab you, you know? You have to meet it halfway.
Character 1: What else you got?
626 Character 2: Okay, um — [Speaking faster] if you want something with a bit more shape to it, there's this band Cigarettes After Sex. Which — [Soft giggle] also a weird name, I'm realizing there's a theme here. But they're more like, uh, slowcore? Very — very velvet. The self-titled album from 2017 is a good entry point.
Character 1: Are they actually good or just trendy?
627 Character 2: [Speaking slower] No that's — that's a fair question. Um. I think they're genuinely good? Like, they kind of got meme'd for a while because every coffee shop was playing them but — [Soft giggle] underneath all that they're doing something real, I think. The songwriting is, uh, surprisingly sharp.
Character 1: What do you actually listen to though?
628 Character 2: [Laughing] Oh god. Um. Lately? Lots of Japanese ambient stuff. There's this guy Hiroshi Yoshimura — he made this album in, like, 1986 called "Green" and it's just — [Speaking slower] it's like being inside a greenhouse. Very still. I put it on when I'm closing up the shop sometimes. [Soft giggle] Makes sweeping feel, uh, profound somehow.
Character 1: That's kind of beautiful actually.
629 Character 2: [Soft giggle] Yeah? Thanks. I think about it a lot honestly. Like — [Speaking slower] music is so tied to, um, to place for me. And moment. Same song can feel totally different depending on where you are when you hear it. That's kind of magic, right?
Character 1: Do you remember the first album you really loved?
630 Character 2: [Excited] Oh man. Okay so — this is embarrassing but — it was the Garden State soundtrack. [Laughing] I know, I know. Very 2004. But I was like — fourteen? And it just cracked something open in me. [Speaking slower] The Shins, Iron & Wine, all that stuff. It felt like someone was, um, handing me a map to a place I didn't know existed.
Character 1: That's not embarrassing.
631 Character 2: [Soft giggle] You're being nice. But no, I — I mean it shaped everything, you know? Like I wouldn't be standing here, in this shop, recommending you Grouper albums if — if some movie about Zach Braff being sad in New Jersey hadn't, uh, rewired my brain at fourteen. [Laughing] Life's weird like that. [Speaking slower] Anyway — you want me to pull some of these for you to listen to, or?
Character 1: I think I messed up.
632 Character 2: Okay. What kind of messed up are we talking? Like, forgot-to-reply-to-an- email messed up or, or something bigger?
Character 1: Bigger.
633 Character 2: [speaking slowly] Alright. I'm here. What happened?
Character 1: I told my dad I don't want him at my wedding.
634 Character 2: Oh. Wow. Okay. That's, I mean— when did this happen?
Character 1: Last night. We were on the phone and it just came out.
635 Character 2: It just— like you didn't plan to say it? It just, it happened?
Character 1: Yeah. He was going on about the guest list again and I just... snapped.
636 Character 2: [chuckle] I mean, guest list stuff is, it's stressful. But that's a big thing to say in a snap. How did he, uh, how did he react?
Character 1: He went quiet. Then he said "okay" and hung up.
637 Character 2: [speaking slowly] Just... okay? That's it?
Character 1: That's it. And now I feel sick about it.
638 Character 2: Yeah, no, I bet. The quiet ones are, they're almost worse than if he'd yelled, right? At least with yelling you know where you stand.
Character 1: Exactly. Now I don't know if he's hurt or relieved or what.
639 Character 2: [sad] Do you think he might be... relieved?
Character 1: Maybe? We haven't been close in years. Not really.
640 Character 2: Right. So this has been, it's been building. The phone call wasn't the, the cause. It was just the, uh, the thing that finally broke.
Character 1: I don't know if I should call him back.
641 Character 2: [speaking slowly] I think... I think you should sit with it first. Like, don't call from guilt. Call when you actually know what you want. Whether that's an apology or a, a real conversation about why you said it. Because both of those are valid but they're, they're very different calls. You know?
Character 1: Dude. Dude. Wake up.
642 Character 2: [very angry] What — what the — it's like 3am, what are you doing?
Character 1: I figured it out.
643 Character 2: [whisper] Figured what out. Why are you — why are you standing over my bed like that, that's so creepy.
Character 1: [very fast] The stock market. I figured out the pattern. It's all based on — on lunar cycles.
644 Character 2: [very loud] Lunar cycles?! You woke me up for — [chuckle] okay. Okay. I'm — I'm listening I guess. Lunar cycles.
Character 1: [happy] Yes! So every time there's a full moon, right, the S&P dips by like — like 2 to 3 percent. Every time!
645 Character 2: That's — that's not — [chuckle] that's not how anything works. Did you sleep at all tonight or have you just been, um, staring at charts?
Character 1: I had like four Red Bulls.
646 Character 2: [very loud] Four?! Dude it's — it's Tuesday. You have work tomorrow. We both have work tomorrow. [whisper] Why are you like this.
Character 1: [cheerful] Because I'm gonna be rich! And — and you're gonna thank me. I'm putting in $500 tomorrow.
647 Character 2: [very angry] You're not — please tell me you're not actually — [chuckle] you know what, fine. Fine. Lose your money. I'm going back to sleep.
Character 1: Don't you want to hear about Mercury retrograde though?
648 Character 2: [very loud] No! No I absolutely do not! [whisper] Oh my god. [chuckle] Mercury retrograde. You're — you're actually insane. You know that right?
Character 1: [happy] I'm a visionary. There's a difference.
649 Character 2: [whisper] There's really not. [chuckle] Okay I'm — look, I love you, you're my best friend, but if you don't leave my room in the next ten seconds I'm throwing this pillow at your face.
Character 1: What if I told you I already made $50?
650 Character 2: [very fast] Wait — actually? Like real money? [whisper] From the moon thing? [chuckle] Okay that's — that's either luck or — no it's definitely luck. It's absolutely luck.
Character 1: [cheerful] It's the moon, baby!
651 Character 2: [very loud] It's not the moon! [chuckle] Go to bed! [whisper] Please for the love of — [happy] actually you know what, text me the charts tomorrow. I'm — I'm not saying I believe you but — [chuckle] just send the charts. Now get out.


Script: 6e8b1218 | Role: Customer Support

652 Customer Support: [professionally] Thank you for contacting SafeGuard Insurance. [quickly] I see you're inquiring about your recent rate increase. [pause] How can I help you understand the changes to your premium today?
Customer: [frustrated] My rates just jumped forty percent! [incredulous] I haven't had any accidents, no tickets, nothing—[sighs heavily] so why am I suddenly paying two hundred dollars more every month?
653 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [more quickly] Let me pull up your account right away to review the factors. [pause] Sometimes it's, um, market conditions or regional adjustments that affect rates.
Customer: [sarcastically] Market conditions? [louder] I've been a loyal customer for twelve years! [exasperated sigh] Shouldn't that count for something more than just... automatic increases?
654 Customer Support: [apologetically] You're absolutely right about loyalty mattering. [briskly] Looking at your file here, I see there was a comprehensive review in October. [softer] The increase reflects updated risk assessments for your ZIP code, unfortunately.
Customer: [skeptically] Risk assessments for my ZIP code? [groans] I live in the same quiet suburb I've lived in for a decade. [more firmly] What exactly changed overnight?
655 Customer Support: [quickly] Well, there's been increased claim activity in your area—theft, weather-related damages. [pause] [more reassuringly] But wait, I'm seeing you might qualify for some discounts we haven't applied yet.
Customer: [hopefully] Discounts? [cautiously] Why weren't these already on my account if I qualified? [frustrated chuckle] Seems like something you'd automatically apply to a twelve-year customer.
656 Customer Support: [hurriedly] You're right, they should've been flagged. [brightening] I can add our safe driver discount, multi-policy if you bundle, and—[enthusiastically] oh, there's a new loyalty program that could save you fifteen percent!
Customer: [relieved sigh] Finally, some good news. [more eagerly] So with all these discounts, what are we actually talking about here? [pause] Can you get me back to my original rate?
657 Customer Support: [optimistically] Let me calculate everything right now. [typing quickly] With all three discounts applied, you'd be looking at... [pause] [more hesitantly] about twenty dollars above your previous rate.
Customer: [disappointed] Twenty dollars more is better than two hundred, I guess. [sighs] But it still feels wrong that I'm paying more for literally nothing changing on my end. [resignedly] When would these discounts kick in?
658 Customer Support: [briskly] I can backdate them to your renewal date, actually! [more enthusiastically] You'll see a credit on next month's statement for the overpayment. [reassuringly] Plus, I'm adding a note to review your rate again in six months.
Customer: [somewhat appeased] Well, that's something at least. [curiously] Is there anything else I should be doing to keep my rates from jumping again? [chuckles dryly] Besides moving to a different ZIP code?
659 Customer Support: [helpfully] Actually, yes! [speaking quickly] Installing a security system gives you another five percent off, and our usage-based program—where we monitor safe driving—[pause] that could save up to twenty percent more.
Customer: [thoughtfully] The monitoring program sounds a bit... invasive. [hesitant] But I suppose if it saves money—[groans softly] fine, tell me more about how that works exactly.
660 Customer Support: [enthusiastically] It's really simple! [rapidly] We send you a small device, plugs right into your car, tracks things like hard braking, speed, mileage. [more slowly] Most customers actually find it helps them drive more consciously.
Customer: [skeptically] And if I'm not a "model driver" by your standards? [concerned] Could my rates go up even more? [pause] Because that seems like a risky gamble right now.
661 Customer Support: [reassuringly] Great question—no, your rates can only go down with this program, never up. [confidently] Even if you don't qualify for the maximum discount, you're guaranteed at least three percent off. [brightly] Should I enroll you?
Customer: [sighs deeply] Sure, why not. [resigned] Sign me up for everything—the monitoring, the discounts, whatever it takes. [more firmly] But I'm definitely shopping around before my next renewal, just so you know.

Script: 31f5ee59 | Role: Customer Support

662 Customer Support: Price match desk, this is Marcus. I need your rewards number to access our competitor pricing database.
Customer: Oh, um, rewards number? It's—wait, let me find my card—okay, R-W-3-3-9-0-1-K. But listen, I found this exact TV at another store for way less!
663 Customer Support: Account RW33901K verified. What's the model number of the TV and which competitor has the lower price?
Customer: It's the, uh, Samsung model S-N-6-5-Q-8-0-0, the 65-inch one. BestMart has it for three hundred dollars less—three hundred! Can you believe that?
664 Customer Support: I see the SN65Q800 in our system at $1,299. Do you have BestMart's ad or can you provide their item SKU for verification?
Customer: Yeah, yeah, I've got their website pulled up here—their SKU is, hold on, B-M-4-4-7-2-9-5. But wait, your policy says you match prices, right?
665 Customer Support: Our policy matches identical items with SKU verification. I'm showing BM447295 is actually last year's model, the Q-8-0-0-A, not the current Q-8-0-0-B you're looking at.
Customer: What? No, that's—that can't be right! The pictures look exactly the same, and the specs—hold on, let me check again—they both say 65-inch QLED!
666 Customer Support: The Q800A lacks the new anti-glare coating and has HDMI 2.0 instead of 2.1. Would you like our price on the older model Q800A, which is item T-V-9-9-8-8-2?
Customer: But I don't—why would I want the older one? This is ridiculous, they look identical! Can I speak to a manager about this policy?
667 Customer Support: I can escalate to my supervisor, but the model difference will remain the issue. Should I create case number P-M-C-7-7-3-4-1 for management review?
Customer: Yes, create the case, whatever—P-M-C-7-7-3-4-1, got it. How is the average person supposed to know about these tiny differences between models?
668 Customer Support: Case created and noted your concerns about model variations. You'll receive a callback within 24-48 hours at the phone number ending in 8-2-7-5, is that correct?
Customer: Yeah, that's right, 8-2-7-5. But seriously, your competitors don't make it this complicated—they just match the price if it's basically the same TV!
669 Customer Support: I understand your frustration. Per policy section 3.2, we only match exact model numbers to ensure customers receive identical products and warranties.
Customer: Policy section 3.2—of course there's a section number for this. Fine, what if I just buy the older model then, the TV-99882 one?
670 Customer Support: The TV99882 Q800A is $979 in-store, matching BestMart's current price. Would you like me to check inventory at your local store, zip 9-4-1-2-5?
Customer: Wait, you already match that price? So I could've just—ugh, yes, check the 9-4-1-2-5 store, please.
671 Customer Support: We have three units available for pickup today. I can reserve one under confirmation code R-E-S-9-0-3-3-6 for 24 hours.
Customer: Yeah, okay, reserve it—R-E-S-9-0-3-3-6. I guess I'm getting the older model then, even though this whole thing seems unnecessarily complicated.
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

672 [Disappointed] I can't believe they're—wait, seriously? [Sigh] After twenty years, they're just gonna shut down like that? [Angry] [Fast] This is such garbage, I mean, where else am I supposed to get decent pad thai at 2 AM now? [Sad] My grandpa used to take me there every Sunday when I was little, and now it's just... [Slow] gone. [Sarcastic] Oh great, another chain restaurant moving in, because that's exactly what this neighborhood needs, right? [Tsk] [Happy] You know what though? [Laugh] At least I got to try their secret menu before they closed—that was kinda legendary. [Whisper] I heard the owner's actually retiring to, um, to Italy or something? [Slow] Good for them, I guess, but still. [Shout] No no no, they can't close before my birthday dinner next week! [Groan] I literally made reservations two months ago! [Disappointed] [Fast] So basically my entire dating strategy just went out the window—that was my go-to first date spot, y'know? [Angry] [Sigh] The landlord tripled their rent, can you believe that? It's like they're trying to—ugh, whatever. [Sad] I was gonna propose there next month because that's where we, um, where we first met. [Slow] [Sigh] [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, let's just bulldoze every place with actual character and replace it with another juice bar. [Happy] Honestly? [Fast] The chef told me she's opening her own place downtown, so like, we're not really losing her! [Disappointed] [Tsk] Their soup dumplings were literally the only thing getting me through this semester, and now what? [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda saw this coming—the health inspector was there like every other week. [Slow] [Angry] [Shout] Five generations of the same family running that place, and some tech company just—just bought them out! [Sad] My mom's gonna be devastated when she finds out, that's—[Sigh] that's where she went after every chemo session. [Sarcastic] [Fast] I mean, who needs authentic cuisine when we can have our fourteenth smoothie bowl place instead, right? [Happy] [Laugh] Remember when we accidentally ordered everything on the menu that one night? At least we did that before—yeah. [Disappointed] [Slow] Forty-seven Yelp reviews I wrote for them over the years, and for what? For nothing. [Whisper] [Chuckle] I actually stole their menu on the last day—don't tell anyone, but I needed something to remember them by.1115 [Happy] Oh wow, your mom's garden is just—I mean, those roses are incredible! [Chuckle] My mom would be so jealous right now. [Nervous] [Fast] So, um, should I have brought wine instead of flowers? I kept going back and forth at the store for like twenty minutes. [Whisper] Did your dad just give me the look? [Tsk] [Whisper] The one where he's sizing me up? [Slow] Your childhood photos are, uh... [Laugh] [Happy] You were really into that superhero phase, weren't you? [Disappointed] [Sigh] I practiced this whole introduction speech in the car and I just—I completely blanked the second they opened the door. [Sarcastic] Oh great, they're bringing out the baby album. [Chuckle] This is exactly what I was hoping for tonight. [Fast] [Happy] Yes, I absolutely love golf—well, I mean, I've mini-golfed a couple times, but that counts, right? [Angry] [Whisper] You didn't tell me your ex was gonna be in half these family photos on the wall! [Sad] I'm trying so hard not to mess this up, but I just—I dunno, I feel like everything I say comes out wrong. [Sigh] [Shout] The cat's on fire! [Fast] [Shout] No wait—it's just the candle behind it, sorry, false alarm! [Slow] So when your mom said "casual dinner," she meant, like... [Tsk] [Disappointed] Five courses and actual silverware placement rules? [Happy] [Laugh] Your dad and I actually went to the same college—I mean, twenty years apart, but still, what are the odds? [Sarcastic] Sure, I'd love to hear another story about how perfect you were in high school. [Fast] No really, please continue. [Whisper] [Fast] Is that their priest at the door? You said this wasn't gonna be a whole religious interrogation thing! [Happy] This lasagna is honestly—wait, you made this from scratch? [Slow] Okay, now I get where they learned to cook. [Angry] I can't believe you're taking their side about the—actually, y'know what, let's just drop it. [Groan] [Chuckle] Um, did your mom just slip me her business card? [Sarcastic] Because nothing says "welcome to the family" like networking. [Sad] [Slow] The way they talk about your brother makes me wonder if I'll ever, like... measure up to that standard. [Fast] [Happy] Oh my god, yes, I totally remember that commercial! [Laugh] Your mom and I have the exact same terrible taste in TV! [Disappointed] [Whisper] They keep calling me by your ex's name and I'm just—I'm gonna pretend I don't notice anymore. [Sigh]--- MONOLOGUE ---

SCENARIO: Upset about a friend group excluding them, then finds out it was planning a surprise for them
==================================================

[frustrated]
So I found out today that like, apparently everyone in our friend group has been hanging out without me? Like Sarah posted this story and I can see Jake and Emma and literally everyone just— just having this great time at that new arcade place.

[hurt] [slightly bitter]
And I'm just sitting here like, cool, glad to know where I stand, you know? Like I thought we were all close but apparently I'm just... I don't know, the extra person they invite when they feel bad or something.

[getting more upset]
I've been wracking my brain all day trying to figure out what I did wrong. Like did I say something? Am I annoying them? Because they've been weird for like two weeks now, all these inside jokes and—

[surprised]
Oh wait, Emma's calling me right now. That's... weird timing. Hold on let me just—

[confused] [cautious]
Okay so apparently they want me to come over to Sarah's house right now? Like immediately? She sounds all frantic and she's like "just trust me, just come over" and I'm like—

[realization dawning] [sheepish]
Oh my God. Oh my God, it's my birthday next week. [nervous laugh] They're planning something aren't they? 

[embarrassed] [warm]
I'm an idiot. I'm literally the worst friend ever, I spent the whole day being bitter about them excluding me when they're probably just trying to— [small laugh] God, I feel so stupid right now.

675 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: 775e6936

SCENARIO: Casually talking about a lock they've been meaning to change, then thinking about who has the old key, then mentally listing everyone with access, spiraling into security vulnerability anxiety
==================================================

[casual]
Oh, so I finally bought that new lock for the front door today. You know, the one I've been talking about getting for like three months? [light laugh] Yeah, I actually did it. Haven't installed it yet, but hey, progress.

[matter-of-fact]
I mean, the old one works fine, it's just— I don't know, I keep thinking about who has keys to that thing. Like, obviously you do, and my sister, my parents...

[slightly concerned]
But wait, didn't I give one to Jake when he was watching the place last year? And oh god, what about when I had those contractors come in February? Did they make copies?

[more worried]
Actually, you know what, I gave a spare to my downstairs neighbor too, the old lady, Mrs. Chen. But what if she— I mean, she could have given it to anyone. Her son comes by all the time, her cleaning lady...

[anxious]
Oh my god, and the landlord still has the master, right? And property management, they probably have like a whole drawer of keys just sitting there. Anyone could just— [sharp exhale] anyone could just walk into my apartment.

[spiraling] [nervous laugh]
I'm sitting here with my laptop, my TV, all my stuff, and like half the city probably has access to my front door! Why didn't I change this thing sooner? What is wrong with me?

[panicked]
I need to install this lock tonight. Right now. This is insane!

676 SCENARIO: [scenario description]==================================================Source: b7a7ed66

SCENARIO: Mad about a missed call, then they text the information instead
==================================================

[angry]
So I'm literally sitting there waiting for this call from my insurance company, right? Like I've been on hold for twenty minutes, and then they finally— they finally say someone's gonna call me back within the hour about my claim.

[frustrated]
And of course, of course I miss it. I was in the bathroom for like two seconds and I hear my phone ringing and I'm like running, literally running back to grab it, and— [groan] — missed call. No voicemail, nothing.

[irritated]
So now I have to call back, sit on hold again for God knows how long, probably get transferred three times, explain my whole situation over again to someone new who's gonna be like "oh let me look that up for you" and put me on hold for another—

[surprised]
Oh wait, hold on. I'm getting a text right now, um...

[reading, confused]
It's from them? It says... okay, your claim has been approved, reference number whatever, payment will be processed in 3-5 business days. 

[relieved] [slightly sheepish]
Oh. Well that's— that's actually way better than sitting on another call for an hour. [chuckle] I guess they just texted me everything I needed to know anyway.

[lighter]
Man, I was so worked up about that. Sometimes the easy way works out, huh?
