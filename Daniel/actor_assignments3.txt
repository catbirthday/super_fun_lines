Character 1: This is the third time.
164 Character 2: I know, I know—before you say anything else, just let me—I'm sorry, okay? I really didn't think it would be a big deal this time because the situation was kinda different and—no, that's not an excuse. I'm making excuses.
Character 1: We literally talked about this last week.
165 Character 2: We did, you're right, we totally did and I just—I wasn't thinking. Or I mean, I was thinking but I thought maybe since it was just my cousin asking, it would be— okay, hearing myself say that out loud, I realize how stupid that sounds.
Character 1: So you do remember what I said.
166 Character 2: Of course I remember! I just—sometimes my brain and my mouth don't, y'know, connect properly and I end up doing the thing anyway even though I know I shouldn't. Like, I literally told myself this morning "don't bring it up, don't bring it up" and then—
Character 1: And then you brought it up.
167 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I did. God, I'm—I'm such an idiot. You set a really clear boundary and I just keep stomping all over it like it doesn't matter but it does matter, I swear it matters to me.
Character 1: Does it? Because from where I'm standing...
168 Character 2: No no no, it does, I promise it does. I just have this—this really bad habit of like, thinking I know better in the moment? Which sounds terrible. I don't mean I know better than you, I just mean—ugh, I'm explaining this so badly.
Character 1: You're doing this with other people too, aren't you.
169 Character 2: I—what? What do you mean?
Character 1: Marcus told me you did the same thing to him. About his job stuff.
170 Character 2: Oh. Oh god, he—he talked to you about that? I didn't... okay, yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm basically just—I'm a terrible friend, aren't I? Like genuinely, I'm starting to realize I might actually have a real problem with just... respecting what people ask me not to do.
Character 1: Starting to realize?
171 Character 2: Okay okay, I should've—I should've realized way earlier. You're right. I think I just get so caught up in trying to help or trying to like, be part of things that I forget that sometimes helping means shutting up, y'know?
Character 1: Yeah. That's exactly what it means.
172 Character 2: I'm gonna—I wanna do better. I mean it this time, like really mean it. Would you maybe... I dunno, would you be willing to like, call me out? In the moment? Because apparently I'm really bad at catching myself.
Character 1: I've been calling you out. That's what this is.
173 Character 2: No, I know, but I mean like—right when I start doing it. Just like, give me a look or kick me under the table or something. I really don't wanna lose you as a friend over my stupid inability to keep my mouth shut when I need to.

Script: 66a12ac2_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You posted the photos.
174 Character 2: What? Oh—yeah, from last night? I mean, they were really good shots and everyone was asking about them, so I figured—wait, why do you look so pissed?
Character 1: I told you not to.
175 Character 2: You... what? No, you didn't. I would've remembered if you—hold on, when did you supposedly tell me this?
Character 1: Three times. At dinner.
176 Character 2: Okay okay, that's— I literally don't remember that at all. Are you sure you actually said it? 'Cause sometimes you kinda just think things really loud and assume everyone heard you.
Character 1: I said it. Out loud. Multiple times.
177 Character 2: Well I—look, if you did say it, I honestly didn't hear you. The restaurant was super loud and I was trying to deal with that waiter who kept messing up our order, remember? I wasn't ignoring you on purpose.
Character 1: Right.
178 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Don't just say "right" like that. I'm being serious here. You're acting like I deliberately went against what you wanted, which is not—that's not what happened. I wouldn't do that to you.
Character 1: But you did.
179 Character 2: Because I didn't know! How is that my fault if I genuinely didn't hear you? I mean, come on, you could've texted me or—or pulled me aside later to make sure I got it.
Character 1: I shouldn't have to repeat myself three times.
180 Character 2: Maybe not, but if it was that important—look look, I'm not saying you're wrong to be upset, but you're treating me like I'm some terrible friend who doesn't care about your feelings, and that's... that's really unfair.
Character 1: Those photos were private.
181 Character 2: How was I supposed to know that? You were posing! You were literally smiling and doing peace signs and—and now suddenly I'm the bad guy for sharing them? Everyone else was posting their pics from the party.
Character 1: Everyone else isn't you.
182 Character 2: What's that supposed to—okay, fine. Fine fine. I'll take them down, alright? But I still think you're being kinda harsh about this when it was clearly just a misunderstanding.
Character 1: It's been up for six hours.
183 Character 2: Yeah, well, I didn't know it was a problem until literally right now! I'm sorry it upset you, I am, but I can't—I dunno, I can't apologize for not being a mind reader, y'know?

Script: 42258053_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You still think you were right.
184 Character 2: I mean—it's not about being right, okay? I'm just saying that maybe, maybe we both kinda messed up here, and you're making it seem like it's all on me.
Character 1: You're the one who said those things.
185 Character 2: Yeah, I did, but you're— you're leaving out the part where you basically cornered me in front of everyone. Like, what was I supposed to do, just stand there and take it?
Character 1: So you had to go there.
186 Character 2: I didn't—okay okay, I shouldn't have said what I said about your ex. That was... yeah. But honestly? You've been holding this over my head for three days now and I'm kinda done pretending I'm the only one who screwed up.
Character 1: I'm not asking you to pretend anything. Just apologize.
187 Character 2: But that's—that's the thing though! You want me to apologize like I'm a hundred percent wrong, and I'm not. I'm sorry I hurt you, I am, but I'm not gonna sit here and act like you didn't push me there.
Character 1: Right. My fault you can't control yourself.
188 Character 2: See? See, this is what you do. You get all—you twist everything I say. I'm trying to explain that we both—y'know what, fine. Fine fine. If you wanna be like this.
Character 1: Be like what exactly?
189 Character 2: Like you're perfect! Like you never—um, remember when you told Jake about my thing with my dad? Where was my apology then? But I let it go because that's what friends do.
Character 1: That was different.
190 Character 2: How? How was it different? Because you did it? Look look, I'm not trying to keep score here, but you're being kinda hypocritical and it's— it's honestly exhausting.
Character 1: Then maybe we shouldn't do this anymore.
191 Character 2: Wait, what? You're gonna—are you seriously gonna throw away our entire friendship because I won't give you the exact apology you want? That's... wow. Okay.
Character 1: Not what I said.
192 Character 2: Then what—what are you saying? Because from where I'm standing, you want me to grovel, and I'm just... I'm not gonna do that. I'm sorry I hurt you, truly, but I'm also kinda hurt that you can't even acknowledge your part in this.
Character 1: Fine. We both messed up. Happy?
193 Character 2: No, I'm not— I'm not happy. I just wanted us to actually talk about this instead of you freezing me out until I cave. But whatever, I guess this is progress or something.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 9c8fb73a | Role: Character B

Character A: [defensive] Look, I know waiting tables isn't glamorous, but [voice rising] I booked a commercial last month! [proudly] That's progress, Sarah. The industry takes time—you can't just calculate success like a spreadsheet.
194 Character B: [measured tone] A commercial in four years, Marcus. [pause] [deliberately] Meanwhile, you're thirty-two with no savings, no health insurance, and [softer] Mom keeps asking if you need money again.
Character A: [bitterly] Not everyone wants to spend their life in a cubicle counting other people's money! [Scoff] [quieter] Some of us actually have dreams that matter more than a 401k and dental benefits.
195 Character B: [hurt] Dreams don't pay rent. [firmly] Remember when you got evicted? [Sigh] I covered your deposit, first month, and never asked for it back because I believed you'd make it.
Character A: [mumbling] That was different, I was between agents and— [suddenly louder] Wait, you believed? [accusingly] Past tense? So what, you've just given up on me completely now?
196 Character B: [exhausted whisper] I'm tired, Marcus. [normal volume] Every family dinner, you perform monologues about your big break coming. [sarcastically] But the only thing breaking is Mom's heart watching you struggle unnecessarily.
Character A: [voice cracking] You think I enjoy this? [Bitter laugh] [rushed words] Every audition rejection feels like drowning, but at least I'm swimming toward something real, not just... existing.
197 Character B: [gentle] Existing isn't so bad when you can afford groceries. [pleading] Take the management position at the restaurant—act on weekends. [hopefully] You'd have stability and still chase your passion.
Character A: [mockingly] Oh perfect, the accountant has it all figured out! [Snort] [trembling] You gave up piano for spreadsheets, and now you want me to surrender too?
198 Character B: [sharp intake] [coldly] I teach piano to six students after work. [building intensity] I didn't give up—I grew up and found balance. There's no shame in being practical about dreams.
Character A: [quietly] Six students isn't Carnegie Hall, Sarah. [pause] [desperately] If I take that job, I become another nobody who almost made it—another cautionary tale about settling.
199 Character B: [frustrated shout] You're already a cautionary tale! [quieter] About pride, about stubbornness. [Groan] [sadly] I just want my brother to stop suffering for something that might never happen.
Character A: [hollow laugh] Suffering? [philosophically] Every great actor suffered first—De Niro drove cabs, Brad Pitt dressed as a chicken. [with conviction] This is my journey, not a mistake to be corrected.
200 Character B: [wearily] Those guys made it by thirty. [matter-of-fact] Statistics show less than two percent of actors earn a living wage. [Pause] [gently] I'm not trying to crush you, just protect you.
Character A: [angrily] Protect me from what—living? [Shaky breath] [more softly] Yeah, maybe I'll fail spectacularly, but at least I'll know I tried everything instead of wondering "what if."
201 Character B: [voice breaking] What if you wake up at forty, still waiting tables? [steadier] What if you want a family someday? [Sniffle] These aren't just numbers, Marcus—they're years you can't get back.
Character A: [determined whisper] Then they're my years to waste. [building volume] One callback, one right role changes everything. [passionately] You see failure where I see possibility—that's the difference between us.
202 Character B: [resigned] No, the difference is I see reality. [Long sigh] [firmly] But you're right—they're your years. Just promise me you'll consider having a backup plan eventually.
Character A: [thoughtfully] Maybe you're not entirely wrong about the restaurant thing. [Chuckle] [cautiously hopeful] Assistant manager still sounds awful, but... benefits would mean better headshots, acting classes.
203 Character B: [surprised] Wait, really? [excited whisper] Marcus, that's all I wanted—just some stability while you chase this. [warmly] [relieved laugh] You can still be a dreamer with dental insurance, you know.

Script: 92bf2c32 | Role: Character A

204 Character A: [shaking] Is it over? [louder] Is it finally over? [Sobbing breath] I can't hear them anymore—the engines, the whistling—[voice cracking] God, I thought we were dead, I really thought this was it.
Character B: [trembling whisper] We're alive. [more firmly] We're still here, brother. [Choked sob] Feel my heartbeat—it's real, we made it through another night. [gasping] Don't let go yet, please don't let go.
205 Character A: [muffled against shoulder] Three days straight. [Bitter laugh] Three days of hell and we're still breathing. How many didn't make it? [quieter] Johnson was right next to me when the first one hit yesterday morning.
Character B: [hoarse] Don't count them now. [Shuddering breath] Tomorrow we'll count, tomorrow we'll mourn properly. [stronger] Tonight we're just two lucky bastards who get to see another sunrise. [voice breaking] That's enough, that has to be enough.
206 Character A: [hysterical edge] My hands won't stop shaking. [Nervous laugh] Look at them—like leaves in a storm. [whimpering] I used to be steady, remember? Best marksman in the unit. Now I can't even hold myself together.
Character B: [gentle] You held it together when it mattered. [more intensely] You pulled Martinez into the bunker, saved his life. [Exhale] These hands did that—shaking or not, you're still the bravest damn soldier I know.
207 Character A: [raw voice] I can still smell the smoke. [faster] It's in everything—our clothes, our skin, the air. [Retching sound] Will we ever stop smelling like death? Will anything ever smell clean again after this?
Character B: [hollow] My ears are still ringing. [softer] Like church bells, but wrong—all wrong. [deeply tired] Mom always said war changes you. [Weak laugh] She didn't mention you'd never escape the sounds, even in the silence.
208 Character A: [desperate] Promise me something. [urgently] If we make it home—when we make it home—we never forget this moment. [steadier] Two grown men crying in a crater, grateful just to breathe. This is what survival really looks like.
Character B: [cracking voice] I promise. [Sob] Every nightmare, every cold sweat, every time I wake up screaming—[stronger] I'll remember your arms around me when the world stopped ending. That's what I'll hold onto, brother.
209 Character A: [exhausted whisper] The silence is almost worse. [louder] At least during the bombing you know what's happening. [trailing off] Now it's just waiting—waiting to see if they're really done or just reloading for another round.
Character B: [fierce whisper] Stop thinking ahead. [Shaky breath] We're here now, in this second, breathing. [calmer] Feel the ground beneath us—solid, real. Tomorrow doesn't exist yet. [voice fading] Just be here with me in the quiet.
210 Character A: [laughing through tears] Remember boot camp? [nostalgic] We complained about everything—the food, the drills, the yelling. [Bitter snort] God, what I'd give for those problems now. We were just stupid kids playing soldier.
Character B: [wistful] Twenty miles with full packs seemed like torture. [darkly amused] Now I'd run fifty just to be back there, safe and ignorant. [Sighing] We thought we were becoming men. [broken] We were just becoming ghosts.
211 Character A: [barely audible] My sister's birthday is next week. [stronger] She'll be sixteen. I promised I'd be there, promised I'd bring her something special from overseas. [Choking up] What do I bring her now—nightmares? This tremor in my hands?
Character B: [firmly] You bring yourself home. [emotional] That's the only gift that matters—her brother, alive and whole. [Sniffling] The rest we figure out later. She needs you breathing, not perfect. [quieter] We all do, man.
212 Character A: [sudden panic] Wait—do you hear that? [terrified whisper] There's something—no, no, it's just the wind. [Nervous laugh] Christ, I'm jumping at shadows now. When does it stop? When do we stop being afraid of the sky?
Character B: [soothing] Easy, easy. [steadier] It's just debris settling, nothing more. [Long exhale] We're going to be hearing ghosts for a while. [resigned] But we'll learn the difference again—between danger and memory. Takes time.
213 Character A: [grateful whisper] Thank you. [stronger] For staying, for not letting me face this alone. [voice thick] When everyone else ran for different cover, you stayed. [breaking down] I couldn't have made it without you here.
Character B: [emotional] Where else would I be? [Soft sob] We're brothers now—not by blood, but by this. [firmly] By surviving hell together. [whispered] When we get home, we're still brothers. [stronger] This doesn't end when the war does.

Script: cf1543b8 | Role: Customer Support

214 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, QuickShip Delivery, this is Rachel speaking. [more quickly] How can I assist you with your delivery today?
Customer: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I've been waiting at home all day for a package that requires a signature. [sighs heavily] Nobody showed up, and—and now I see it's marked as "delivery attempted," which is completely false.
215 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh, I'm terribly sorry about that inconvenience. [quickly] Let me just pull up your tracking number—could you provide that for me? [more reassuringly] We'll get this sorted right away.
Customer: [impatiently] It's, uh, QS-7745-892. [groans] Look, I specifically took the day off work for this delivery because it needs a signature. Can't you just tell them to leave it at the door?
216 Customer Support: [professionally] I understand your frustration, truly. [more firmly] Unfortunately, signature-required packages are... they're marked that way by the sender for security reasons. [quickly] We can't override that requirement, but I can schedule a redelivery.
Customer: [exasperated] A redelivery? [louder] So I have to take another day off? [sighs] This is ridiculous—your driver didn't even ring the doorbell!
217 Customer Support: [calmly] Actually, let me check something else here. [briskly] I see there's a depot location about three miles from you—you could collect it there today until 7 PM. [more helpfully] Would that work better for you?
Customer: [skeptically] Three miles... [mutters] I guess that's doable. But wait, will I still need to show ID and sign there, or is this another waste of my time?
218 Customer Support: [quickly] Yes, you'll need a photo ID that matches the delivery address. [reassuringly] But I can, um, I can call ahead to the depot right now. [more confidently] They'll have it ready at the counter for immediate pickup.
Customer: [resigned] Fine, okay, call them. [more firmly] But I want confirmation that it's actually there before I drive over. Last month you guys sent me to a depot and the package wasn't even there.
219 Customer Support: [professionally] Absolutely, I'm placing you on a brief hold. [quickly] I'll personally confirm with the depot manager that your package is there. [more briskly] This should only take two to three minutes, maximum.
Customer: [sarcastically] Oh sure, a brief hold. [chuckles dryly] That's what they all say before I listen to jazz music for twenty minutes.
220 Customer Support: [cheerfully] And I'm back! [quickly] Good news—I spoke directly with Marcus at the Elm Street depot. [more enthusiastically] Your package is behind the counter with a note, ready for pickup.
Customer: [surprised] Oh, that was... actually quick. [more relieved] Elm Street, you said? And they're definitely open until seven?
221 Customer Support: [confidently] Until 7 PM sharp, yes. [helpfully] I've also emailed you a confirmation code—just show that with your ID. [more quickly] Is there anything else I can help resolve today?
Customer: [curiously] Actually, yeah—why does this package even need a signature? [frustrated] It's just a phone case, not like it's jewelry or something valuable.
222 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I completely understand the confusion. [briskly] The sender determines signature requirements, usually for any order over fifty dollars or at their discretion. [more apologetically] We just follow their instructions, unfortunately.
Customer: [groans] Fifty dollars for a phone case... [mutters] Highway robbery. Well, at least I can pick it up today. Thanks for actually helping, unlike the last three people I talked to.
223 Customer Support: [warmly] You're very welcome! [quickly] I've added a note to your account about today's issue. [more reassuringly] If you have any problems at the depot, call back and ask for me directly—Rachel, extension 4021.
Customer: [appreciatively] Extension 4021, got it. [sighs] Hopefully I won't need it, but... yeah, thanks Rachel. [more casually] Have a good rest of your shift.

224 Customer Support: University IT Support, this is Marcus. Can I have your student ID number to access your account?
Customer: Oh, um... yes, it's—wait, let me find my card—okay, S-T-U-2-0-2-4-9-1-7-3. I'm trying to set up my email but nothing is working properly.
225 Customer Support: I see your account, STU20249173. You should have received a temporary password starting with TEMP-8-8-5 in your welcome packet. Have you tried logging in with that?
Customer: The welcome packet? I think... maybe I left it in my dorm or—no wait, I have something here that says T-E-M-P dash 8-8-5-2-K-Q. But when I type it, the system keeps rejecting everything.
226 Customer Support: That password is correct. You're entering it at portal.university.edu/email, correct? Make sure you're using your full email address with the domain @uni.edu.
Customer: Portal dot... sorry, can you repeat? I've been going to mail.university.edu because that's what—someone told me that was right, but maybe they were wrong about it?
227 Customer Support: No, it's portal.university.edu/email. Once there, use your username J-D-O-E-9-1-7-3 followed by @uni.edu as the full address.
Customer: J-D-O-E... wait, that's not—my name is Zhang, not Doe, so shouldn't it be different? This is really confusing because back home our system was completely different from this.
228 Customer Support: Your username is based on your registration, not your actual name. Let me generate a password reset link with ticket number I-T-4-4-2-8-6 and send it to your personal email.
Customer: Oh okay, that makes—I guess that makes sense now. My personal email ends in 1-6-3 at gmail, is that the one you have in the system?
229 Customer Support: I show an email ending 7-6-3 at gmail.com. Can you confirm if that's correct or provide the full address?
Customer: No no, it's—sorry, you're right, it's 7-6-3, I always mix those numbers up. How long until I receive this reset link thing?
230 Customer Support: You should receive it within 5 minutes. The email subject will contain reference code R-E-F-2-2-9-4-A for verification.
Customer: Okay so I wait for R-E-F—what was it—2-2-9-4-A, and then what happens after that? Do I need to call back or does it automatically fix everything?
231 Customer Support: Click the link, create a new password following the requirements shown, then return to portal.university.edu/email to log in. Your case number is C-A-S-E-7-7-3-2 if you need further help.
Customer: The password requirements are—I hope they're not too complicated because sometimes they want capitals and symbols and... it gets really overwhelming honestly.
232 Customer Support: You'll need 8 characters minimum with one capital, one number, and one special character. Keep your case number handy if you experience any issues.
Customer: Eight characters with—okay I think I can manage that maybe. Should I stay on this chat or hang up—I mean, disconnect now?
233 Customer Support: You can disconnect now. If the reset doesn't work within 10 minutes, contact us again with case number C-A-S-E-7-7-3-2.
Customer: Alright, thank you so much, I'll try—hopefully this works because I really need to check my class schedule. Have a good day!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

234 [Disappointed] I mean, I've been sitting here for like an hour and a half, just... watching everyone else on their dates. [Sigh] [Angry] [Fast] You know what, I'm done—I'm literally done waiting for people who can't even send a simple text. [Sarcastic] Oh great, the waiter's coming back to ask if I'm "still waiting for someone" for the third time. [Tsk] [Sad] [Slow] Maybe something happened to them, like an emergency or—no, who am I kidding? [Happy] Actually, y'know what, their loss—I'm gonna order that expensive dessert I was too polite to get! [Chuckle] [Whisper] Um, excuse me, can I just get the check please? [Fast] Yeah, no, nobody's coming. [Disappointed] [Sigh] I literally shaved my legs for this, bought a new outfit, and they couldn't even—whatever. [Angry] [Shout] Are you kidding me right now?! I turned down plans with my friends for this! [Sad] My mom's gonna ask how it went and I'm just... I dunno what to tell her. [Slow] [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Well, at least I discovered this place has amazing breadsticks, so the night's not a total loss, right? [Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, wait, is that my ex at the bar? This is actually—this is perfect karma! [Disappointed] I keep checking my phone like maybe I got the day wrong, but... nope, it's definitely tonight. [Tsk] [Whisper] [Sad] I feel like everyone in this restaurant knows I've been stood up, they keep looking over here. [Angry] They seemed so genuine when we were texting, like how do people just—ugh, I'm so stupid. [Groan] [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let me just sit here with this candle and these two place settings, totally not obvious or anything. [Happy] Honestly? Kinda relieved—I was nervous anyway and now I can just go home and binge that show. [Chuckle] [Fast] [Disappointed] I'm deleting the app, I'm done with online dating, this is like the third time this has happened. [Sad] [Whisper] Maybe I came on too strong in our messages or something, I dunno, maybe it's me. [Angry] [Fast] [Groan] Twenty-seven dollars for parking, an Uber here, and they don't even show up—unbelievable! [Slow] [Sigh] You know what, I'm gonna finish this wine, eat their portion of the appetizer, and just... try to salvage the evening somehow.

235 [Angry] I've been listening to this same jazz loop for—God, it's gotta be what, sixty times now? [Groan] My ear is literally going numb from holding this phone. [Sarcastic] Oh sure, my call is "very important" to you, that's why I'm, like, basically aging in real time here. [Tsk] [Whisper] Hello? Is anyone—wait, no, that's just the music restarting again. [Sigh] [Fast] I can't hang up now 'cause I've invested too much time but I also can't keep—this is insane, right? [Disappointed] [Happy] Finally heard a click! Oh wait, no, that's just—nope, more hold music. [Laugh] I'm losing it. [Slow] You know what's funny? I don't even remember what I was calling about anymore. [Chuckle] [Sad] [Shout] Pick up the phone! [Angry] Sorry, I didn't mean to—I'm just gonna put this on speaker and, um, make lunch or something. [Disappointed] They said "just a few more minutes" like, uh, forty-five minutes ago, so... [Tsk] [Sigh] [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, let me just cancel all my plans for today 'cause apparently this is my life now—professional hold music listener. [Whisper] I bet they're all just sitting there, laughing at us idiots on hold. [Angry] [Groan] [Happy] [Chuckle] My kid just asked if this is my job now—sitting here listening to terrible elevator music all day. [Sad] Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if anyone actually works there or if it's just, like, an empty building with phones ringing. [Slow] [Fast] [Angry] Every time it goes quiet for a second I think—but no, it's never a person, it's always just more music starting up! [Sarcastic] "Your estimated wait time is"—oh they stopped saying that twenty minutes ago, that's, um, super reassuring. [Disappointed] [Tsk] [Slow] [Sad] I could've driven to their office, sorted this out in person, and driven home by now, y'know? [Whisper] [Fast] Wait wait wait, I hear breathing—no, false alarm, I think that was just me. [Shout] [Laugh] This music is gonna haunt my dreams tonight! I mean, I'll probably hum it at dinner without even realizing— [Disappointed] The worst part? I'm gonna have to do this all over again tomorrow if I hang up now. [Sigh] [Slow] [Happy] Oh my God, a human voice! Wait—no, it's just the "thank you for holding" message again. [Groan] [Angry] [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] I should probably update my address with them 'cause I basically live on this call now, right?

Oh my god, so I had that interview today at Morrison & Associates? The marketing firm I was telling you about? And it went so well, like— I think it actually went really well.

[enthusiastic]
The creative director was asking me all these questions about campaign strategy and I just felt like, you know, like I was totally in my element. Like everything I said just clicked with what they were looking for.

[starting to deflate]
But then afterward I started thinking, like... I don't know, maybe I oversold myself? Like they wanted someone with five years of experience and I have eight, so maybe they're gonna think I'm gonna want too much money or that I'll get bored or—

[worried]
God, what if they think I'm gonna leave as soon as something better comes along? I should have played it down more, been less— less enthusiastic about my previous campaigns and stuff.

[surprised]
Oh wait, hold on— they're calling me right now. Should I— okay I'm gonna answer this, hold on.

[deflated] [confused]
That was... okay that was weird. They said I interviewed really well but they've decided to go with someone else because I'm— [sigh] because I'm overqualified and they're worried I won't be satisfied with the role.

[bitter] [half laugh]
So apparently being good at your job is now a bad thing? Great. Just great.

SCENARIO: Casually talking about a friend request they ignored, then checking who it was, then realizing it was someone important they should have accepted, spiraling into social media etiquette regret
==================================================

[casual]
Oh, um, so I got this random friend request yesterday on, uh, on Facebook. I didn't really look at it, just like— you know how it is, I just, um, I just declined it without really checking who it was.

[matter-of-fact]
I mean, I don't really, uh, I don't really accept requests from people I don't recognize anymore, you know? Too many weird, um, weird spam accounts and stuff. So I was just like, nope, delete, whatever.

[conversational]
But now I'm thinking about it and I'm like, uh, I'm like maybe I should've— maybe I should've at least looked at the, um, the profile first? Like what if it was someone, uh, someone legitimate, you know?

[slight concern]
Hold on, let me— let me just check real quick who it was. I think you can still see, um, see declined requests somewhere in the... [pause] Okay, here we go, recent activity and—

[realization dawning]
Oh. Oh no. Oh my god, that's— that's Sarah Mitchell. From, um, from the marketing conference? The one who said she'd, uh, she'd connect me with her boss about that job opening?

[panicking]
I declined her friend request! She probably thinks I'm, um, I'm completely rude now! What if she— what if she tells her boss I'm antisocial or something? [groan] This is a disaster! I literally just, uh, just sabotaged my own networking because I can't be bothered to— to look at a name for two seconds!

SCENARIO: Offhandedly talking about a vaccination they thought they had, then checking their records, then realizing they're not up to date on something important, spiraling into health anxiety
==================================================

[casual]
Oh, so I was at that new clinic today for my physical, and the doctor was asking about my tetanus shot. And I was like, yeah, I got that updated a couple years ago, no problem.

[matter-of-fact]
But then she's looking at her computer with this weird expression, you know? Like squinting at the screen. So she asks me to double-check my records when I get home, just to be sure about the dates.

[slightly concerned]
So I'm looking through my files right now and— [sigh] okay, wait, this doesn't look right. I thought I got it in 2021, but this says... [trailing off] this says 2019?

[more worried]
Hold on, let me check this app thing they have. [pause] Okay, so tetanus is supposed to be every ten years, but the last one before 2019 was... [sharp exhale] 2009? That's not— that's not ten years!

[anxious] [building]
Wait, oh my god, does this mean I've been unprotected this whole time? What if I get lockjaw? I was gardening last week! I probably have a thousand tiny cuts on my hands!

[spiraling] [panicked]
And what else am I missing? [frantic] What if my measles immunity wore off? There was that outbreak at the university! I take the bus every day! [whimper] I could be walking around like a disease magnet and not even know it!

SCENARIO: Mad about a busy signal, then getting through immediately on the next try
==================================================

[irritated]
Okay so I'm trying to call the doctor's office this morning, right? And I get this busy signal. Like an actual busy signal! Who even has busy signals anymore? It's 2024!

[getting more worked up]
So I'm like, fine, whatever, I'll try again in a few minutes. But then I start thinking about it and I'm like— this is so ridiculous. Like I have to take time out of my day to call them, and they can't even, like, put me on hold or something?

[frustrated] [indignant]
And it's not like I'm calling at some weird time, it's literally 10 AM on a Tuesday! [scoff] So I'm getting all worked up about it, like this whole rant in my head about how their phone system is probably from 1987 or whatever.

[building up steam]
I'm like, okay, one more try and then I'm gonna— I don't know what I'm gonna do but I'm gonna be really annoyed about it. So I call back literally thirty seconds later and—

[surprised] [deflated]
It goes straight through. Like immediately. The receptionist picks up on the first ring, super friendly, gets me scheduled right away.

[sheepish] [half laugh]
And now I feel like such an idiot for getting so mad about... nothing? Like maybe someone just hung up right before I called back. [chuckle] I was ready to write a whole Yelp review about their phone system.
