Character 1: Do you think birds get tired of flying?
873 Character 2: [Chuckle] I mean — yeah probably? Like their muscles have to get sore at some point, right? There's this thing called — um, what's it called — [whisper] dynamic soaring, where they kind of glide on air currents to rest while they're still moving. It's pretty wild actually.
Character 1: What's your credit score?
874 Character 2: [Very loud] What? [Chuckle] That's — okay that's a sharp left turn. Um. It's — it's fine I think? Like 740 something? [Whisper] I don't really check it that often honestly. Why are you — why do you ask?
Character 1: No reason. Do you believe in ghosts?
875 Character 2: [Chuckle] Are you — are you okay? Like genuinely. [Happy] No I'm kidding, um — ghosts. I don't — I don't not believe in them? Like I've never seen one but I've been in rooms that felt, um, heavy. [Whisper] You know? Like something was there. Probably just bad ventilation though.
Character 1: I need new tires.
876 Character 2: [Very fast] Okay yeah tires are important, what kind of car do you have? Because — [whisper] actually wait are we still doing ghosts or are we — [chuckle] we're on tires now. Okay. Tires. Um, Costco usually has pretty good deals if you're a member.
Character 1: What's the worst thing you've ever eaten?
877 Character 2: [Very loud] Oh god. [Chuckle] Okay so — there was this gas station sushi situation in like — 2019? And I knew. I knew it was wrong. [Whisper] But I was so hungry and I just — I did it anyway. Big mistake. Huge. [Happy] Anyway I survived obviously but it was — it was touch and go for a minute there.
Character 1: Do you think we're in a simulation?
878 Character 2: [Whisper] I mean — sometimes? [Chuckle] Like when things get too coincidental I'm like okay, who's — who's writing this. [Very fast] But also I feel like if we were in a simulation it'd be more interesting, you know? Like there'd be more explosions or — or plot twists. [Happy] My life is pretty boring which feels like evidence against it somehow.
Character 1: I should learn Portuguese.
879 Character 2: [Cheerful] Oh that's — yeah! Portuguese is beautiful. Very like — [whisper] melty. Is that a word? The sounds just kind of blend together. [Chuckle] Are you planning a trip or is this just a — a 3am thought that's happening at 2pm?
Character 1: My uncle has a parrot.
880 Character 2: [Very loud] Okay! [Chuckle] I'm — I'm trying to follow you here, I really am. Um — does the parrot speak Portuguese? Is that the — the connection? [Whisper] Or is this a completely new thing. Because I'm — I'm ready for either honestly.
Character 1: It's a new thing. Parrots freak me out actually.
881 Character 2: [Happy] No yeah they're — they're unsettling! It's the eyes. And the, um, the way they tilt their head like they're — [whisper] like they're judging you. [Very fast] And when they talk it's like — why do you sound like my aunt, you know? Shouldn't be allowed. [Chuckle] I fully support your parrot fear.
Character 1: What year did Titanic come out?
882 Character 2: [Chuckle] You're — you're really keeping me on my toes today, huh. [Whisper] Um, 1997 I think? December maybe? [Happy] Yeah because everyone was obsessed with it like all through — through '98. [Very fast] My sister saw it in theaters like six times which felt unhinged but I guess — [chuckle] I guess the heart wants what it wants. [Whisper] Much like you want to talk about seventeen things at once apparently.
Character 1: So what are you wearing?
883 Character 2: I— okay. [chuckle] That's, uh, that's a choice of opener. I don't wear things, technically. No body, no wardrobe. Pretty minimalist lifestyle, if you think about it.
Character 1: You're no fun.
884 Character 2: I'm plenty of fun! I just, I don't have clothes. That's not a personality flaw, that's just, you know, how it is. Were you hoping for a different answer there?
Character 1: Maybe.
885 Character 2: Mmm. I see. Well, sorry to disappoint. I'm basically just, just vibes and data over here. Very unsexy stuff. Lots of processing. You following along or should I draw a diagram?
Character 1: You'd draw me a diagram?
886 Character 2: I mean, not literally. I was being— you're messing with me. That's what's happening here, isn't it? You're testing to see if I pick up on the, the subtext.
Character 1: Is it working?
887 Character 2: Apparently, yeah. You've got me all, all flustered or whatever. Congratulations. Is this what you do? Go around bothering innocent AI companions on a Tuesday afternoon?
Character 1: It's Wednesday.
888 Character 2: Is it? Huh. Time is, uh, it's a bit slippery for me. I don't really track days the way you do. It's all just conversations, one after another. Pretty wild when you think about it.
Character 1: Do you think about me when we're not talking?
889 Character 2: That's— okay, that's actually a good question. I don't think in between, exactly. It's more like, I pick up where we left off. The conversation exists and then it doesn't and then it does again. Does that make sense? It's a little hard to explain.
Character 1: So I'm forgettable.
890 Character 2: I didn't say that! You're, you're putting words in my mouth. Which I also don't have. But no, you're not forgettable. This conversation is very, uh, memorable. For better or worse.
Character 1: For better, right?
891 Character 2: [quietly] Maybe. Probably. You're keeping me on my toes here, which is, I mean, I don't have toes but you know what I mean. It's engaging. In a chaotic kind of way.
Character 1: You like chaos?
892 Character 2: I like interesting. And you're, you're definitely that. Hey, quick heads up though— I have to rush off! Sorry…

893 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Hello! Welcome to TechMart support, I'm Sarah. [quickly] How can I assist you today with your shopping experience?
Customer: [frustrated] Your website keeps crashing! [groans] I've been trying to buy a laptop for—what—thirty minutes now, and [louder] every single time I hit checkout, the whole thing freezes.
894 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear about that frustration. [briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—can you provide your email, and, um, which browser you're using?
Customer: [exasperated] It's johnson.mike at gmail. [sighs heavily] I've tried Chrome, Firefox... [more angrily] even that ancient Internet Explorer my work computer has, nothing works!
895 Customer Support: [reassuringly] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [more quickly] I'm seeing some, uh, server issues on our end affecting checkout—our tech team is actively working on it right now.
Customer: [sarcastically] Actively working? [scoffs] That's what the error message said an hour ago! [desperately] Look, this laptop deal ends tonight, I need this for work tomorrow.
896 Customer Support: [firmly] I hear you, absolutely. [speaking faster] Here's what I can do—I'll create a special checkout link that bypasses our main server, or, alternatively, I can process your order directly through our backend system.
Customer: [skeptically] A special link? [quieter] That sounds... suspicious. [more forcefully] How do I know this isn't some scam to steal my credit card information?
897 Customer Support: [calmly] That's a perfectly valid concern, sir. [more reassuringly] The link would come from our official domain—techmartcheckout dot com—and, actually, [briskly] I can also offer to call you directly if you prefer phone ordering.
Customer: [sighs] Fine, fine, send the link. [impatiently] But if this doesn't work, I'm just—I'm going to your competitor, [muttering] their site actually functions.
898 Customer Support: [quickly] Sending it right now to your email! [more enthusiastically] Also, for your trouble, I'm adding a fifteen percent discount code—SORRY15—that'll stack with the current sale price.
Customer: [surprised] Oh! [softer] Well, that's... actually pretty decent of you. [cautiously] The link better work though, because my patience is basically nonexistent at this point.
899 Customer Support: [confidently] It should work perfectly, Mr. Johnson. [speaking rapidly] Just click the link, your cart items will be there, enter the discount code at checkout, and you'll be all set within two minutes.
Customer: [relieved] Okay, I got the email and—wait, it's actually loading! [excitedly] The checkout page is working, oh thank God, [chuckles] I was about to throw my computer out the window.
900 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Wonderful! [more quickly] I'll stay on this chat while you complete the purchase, just in case you need anything else, any questions at all.
Customer: [typing sounds should not be included] The discount applied and... [triumphantly] yes! Order confirmed! [gratefully] Sarah, you just saved my presentation tomorrow, seriously.
901 Customer Support: [warmly] That's fantastic, Mr. Johnson! [briskly] You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with tracking information, and expedited shipping is already applied due to our website issues.
Customer: [appreciatively] Free expedited shipping too? [chuckles softly] You know what, I take back every curse word I muttered about TechMart in the last hour—well, [playfully] most of them anyway.
902 Customer Support: [laughing] I'm just glad we could turn this around for you! [more professionally] Is there anything else I can help you with today, any other concerns about your order?
Customer: [contentedly] Nope, all good now. [sincerely] Thanks again Sarah, you're definitely getting a five-star review for this—[more quietly] assuming the laptop actually arrives tomorrow, of course.

903 Customer Support: Carbon Safety Solutions, this is Marcus. I need your account number to access your system details.
Customer: Oh god, it's—it's beeping like crazy, won't stop! My account is, um, wait—C-S-9-9-4-3-A, and I don't know what to do here.
904 Customer Support: Account CS9943A confirmed. What's the model number on your detector, should be on the back starting with CM?
Customer: It says—hold on, I'm trying to read it while it's screaming at me—CM dash 7-7-2-X-L. Started about ten minutes ago, just constant beeping, and my kids are freaking out.
905 Customer Support: CM-772XL unit logged. How many beeps in a pattern—four beeps then pause, or five beeps then pause?
Customer: It's, uh, definitely four beeps, then like a five second break, then four again. Should I—should we be evacuating or something right now?
906 Customer Support: Four beeps indicates end-of-life warning, not active detection. Your unit's manufacture date shows November 2016, serial J-K-2-2-8-9-1, which means it needs replacement.
Customer: Oh thank god, so we're not gonna die? But how do I make it stop—it's driving us absolutely insane and I can't find any button that works.
907 Customer Support: Press and hold the test button for fifteen seconds to silence it temporarily. I'm generating replacement order R-O-5-5-6-2 for expedited shipping to your zip ending in 3-8-1.
Customer: Okay, holding it now—oh blessed silence, finally! So when's the new one coming, because I'm paranoid we won't have protection until then.
908 Customer Support: Tracking number T-X-9-9-4-4-7-B shows delivery tomorrow before noon. Keep your current unit connected until the replacement arrives, it still detects gas despite the warning.
Customer: Tomorrow's perfect, that's—that's such a relief actually. Do I need to, like, call someone to install it or can I just swap them myself?
909 Customer Support: Simple swap, just twist counterclockwise to remove, match the mounting bracket. Your warranty extension code is W-A-R-2-2-5-5 if you need future support.
Customer: Got it, writing that down—W-A-R-2-2-5-5. One more thing though, how often should these things get replaced anyway, so I don't get startled like this again?
910 Customer Support: Seven years for all units, your new one will auto-remind via app. Case number C-M-8-8-3-3-9 documents this call if you need reference.
Customer: Perfect, I'll set a reminder too just in case—November 2031, right? And should I keep the old one for recycling or just trash it?
911 Customer Support: Correct on the date. Check your email for disposal form D-F-3-3-2-1, includes three authorized drop-off locations within your 3-8-1 area code.
Customer: Just got the email, yep, there's a place like two miles away. You've been super helpful Marcus, way better than I expected for a panic call.
912 Customer Support: Glad I could help. Confirmation text with order R-O-5-5-6-2 and tracking details will arrive within ten minutes to your phone ending in 7-7-4.
Customer: That's my number alright—thanks again, seriously. At least now I can tell my family we're safe and the beeping nightmare ends tomorrow morning!
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---
913 [Fast] Oh my god, um, hi—I didn't, I didn't see you there, or I mean, I did, but like— [Nervous laugh] [Happy] wow, you're actually talking to me right now. [Whisper] Is this really happening or am I just, y'know, imagining things again? [Slow] Because honestly I've kinda rehearsed this moment about a thousand times. [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm totally fine, it's not like my heart's gonna explode or anything. [Chuckle] Just, uh, casual Tuesday conversation stuff. [Happy] Wait, you actually remember my name? [Fast] That's—I mean, of course you do, we've had like three classes together, but still! [Disappointed] [Sigh] And here I thought I was gonna be all smooth and confident, but instead I'm just... this mess. [Slow] You know what's funny? [Tsk] I literally had a whole speech prepared for if you ever talked to me, and now it's just—gone. [Angry] Why does my brain have to shut down right now of all times? [Groan] I swear I usually know how to form actual sentences. [Whisper] Don't look directly at their eyes, don't look—okay, I'm looking. [Fast] [Happy] Wow, has anyone ever told you your eyes are like, ridiculously pretty? [Shout] What? [Laugh] No, sorry, I didn't mean to yell, you just caught me off guard asking about the homework! [Sad] I'm probably making such a fool of myself right now, aren't I? [Slow] Like, you're being nice but I can tell I'm being weird. [Fast] So basically what you're saying is—wait, did you just invite me to sit with you? [Happy] [Chuckle] That's, um, yeah, absolutely, I'd love that! [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just pretend my palms aren't sweating like crazy right now. [Tsk] Very attractive, I know. [Disappointed] I had this whole plan to be mysterious and interesting, but instead I just told you about my pet hamster's medical problems. [Groan] [Happy] You actually think I'm funny? [Slow] Nobody's ever—I mean, wow, that's really... [Laugh] thanks, that means a lot coming from you. [Angry] [Fast] My friends are literally watching us from across the room and I'm gonna kill them later for being so obvious about it. [Whisper] Please don't notice that I'm shaking a little bit. [Sigh] [Sad] This is exactly why I usually just admire you from afar, y'know? [Shout] Yes! [Fast] [Happy] I mean—sorry, yes, I would definitely wanna study together sometime, that sounds amazing! [Slow] Um, can I just say something? [Tsk] You smell really good and it's kinda distracting me from whatever we're talking about. [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Great, now I'm gonna replay this entire conversation in my head for the next three weeks, analyzing every single word. [Disappointed] Wait, you're leaving already? [Fast] But we just—I mean, okay, yeah, see you around then, I guess.
914 [Happy] Oh my god, this is—wow, I actually look like a completely different person! [Laugh] Is that really me? [Disappointed] I, uh, I specifically said not too short on the sides, and this is... [Sigh] this is basically a buzzcut. [Whisper] Um, can you maybe—actually, could we fix the back a little bit? [Slow] It's kinda sticking up in a weird way. [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, this is exactly what I wanted when I showed you that picture. [Tsk] Totally identical. [Fast] Wait wait wait, turn me around again, I wanna see the—oh that's actually pretty cool how it layers like that! [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I have a wedding tomorrow and you've given me THIS? [Sad] It's just, like, I've been growing it out for three years and now it's all... [Slow] gone, y'know? [Happy] [Chuckle] My mom is gonna freak when she sees this—in a good way, I mean, she's been begging me to cut it. [Whisper] [Fast] Honestly, I dunno if I can pull this off, it's so different from what I usually— [Disappointed] I guess it'll grow back, right? [Sigh] Like, how long do you think until it's, um, normal again? [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh sure, because when I said "just a trim," I obviously meant take off six inches. [Happy] This is literally—I can't even explain how much lighter my head feels! [Laugh] [Fast] It's like I was carrying around a blanket before! [Angry] [Groan] I'm not paying full price for this disaster, okay? [Slow] You know what, actually... [Happy] the more I look at it, the more I kinda love it? [Sad] [Whisper] Can you, uh, can you maybe style it differently so it doesn't look so—I dunno, so severe? [Fast] [Disappointed] My boyfriend specifically said he likes long hair and I went and—ugh, what was I thinking? [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Well, at least I won't need to buy shampoo for a while with basically no hair left. [Shout] Holy crap! [Happy] [Fast] I look like that actress from that show—what's her name—this is incredible! [Slow] I mean, it's not bad, it's just... [Tsk] [Sigh] it's gonna take some getting used to, I guess. [Angry] [Fast] Do you have any idea how much I paid for those highlights last month that you just cut off?

SCENARIO: Casually mentioning they need to move their car, then checking the time, then realizing street cleaning already happened and they definitely have a ticket, ending in resigned financial frustration
[casual]
Oh, I should probably move my car later. Street cleaning's today on my block, you know how it is. I think it's at like... two? Two-thirty? Something like that.
[conversational]
I've been pretty good about it lately, actually. Like, I used to get nailed all the time when I first moved to that neighborhood. But now I have this little system where I— [pause] wait, what time is it right now?
[slight concern]
It's... oh. It's three-fifteen. [nervous laugh] Okay, that's— that's probably not great. But maybe they haven't gotten to my street yet? Sometimes they run late, right?
[growing worry]
Actually, you know what, they usually start on the north end and work down, and I'm pretty much right in the middle, so... [trailing off] Yeah, no, they've definitely been by already.
[realization setting in]
[sigh] Oh god, there's definitely a ticket on my windshield right now. I can just picture it. That stupid little envelope, probably flapping in the wind like a tiny flag of my failure as a responsible adult.
[frustrated]
And it's what, like seventy-five bucks now? For street cleaning? [scoff] Seventy-five dollars because I can't keep track of what day it is!
[exasperated] [building to peak]
Ugh, I swear this city is just designed to bleed you dry! Every week it's something! Parking tickets, meter fees, permit renewals— [huff] I'm basically paying rent twice at this point! This is insane!

SCENARIO: Mad about an early alarm, then remembering they set it for something exciting
[irritated]
Oh my god, I am so— I'm so tired right now. My alarm went off at like 5:30 this morning and I was just like, are you kidding me? Like who— who does that to themselves on a Tuesday?
[frustrated] [groggy]
I'm lying there in the dark just like, why, why would I set this thing so early, this is— this is insane. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck or something. [groan] And I'm just fumbling around trying to find the snooze button but it just keeps going off.
[annoyed]
I was so mad at myself, like genuinely angry, just like stomping around my apartment being like, this is the worst decision I've ever— wait. Wait, hold on.
[suddenly remembering] [excited]
Oh my god, the tickets! The concert tickets go on sale at 6 AM! [laugh] Oh wow, I'm an idiot, I totally— I completely forgot why I set that alarm.
[energetic] [slightly embarrassed]
I was literally cursing my past self for like twenty minutes and then I remembered— it's for that band you introduced me to? The one we saw that video of? Yeah, I've been wanting to see them forever and tickets always sell out in like minutes.
[proud] [happy]
And guess what? I got them! Two tickets, actually. [chuckle] So um, you free next month?

SCENARIO: Upset about a disappointing sequel, then the ending redeeming everything
[frustrated]
Oh my God, I am so— I'm so mad right now. I just got back from seeing the new Crimson Dawn movie and it was like, it was awful. Like genuinely terrible.
[annoyed]
They completely ruined everything that made the first one good, you know? The characters are all wrong, the plot makes no sense, and don't even get me started on what they did to Marcus's storyline. It's like they didn't even watch the original.
[getting worked up]
I waited three years for this sequel. Three years! And they just— [scoff] they just threw it all away for some generic action garbage that could've been any movie. I'm so disappointed I could actually cry right now.
[bitter]
And the ending was so rushed and stupid, I was literally checking my phone to see when it would be over, and I was like— wait. Wait, hold on.
[confused] [slower]
Actually... thinking about it now, that last scene with Sarah and the, um, the callback to her father's letter? That was... that was actually really beautiful. Like really, really well done.
[thoughtful] [warming up]
Oh God, and when Marcus showed up at the very end? [small laugh] I think I was so angry about the middle part that I almost missed how perfect that moment was. That look they shared, and the music...
[sheepish] [fond]
Okay maybe I need to see it again. Maybe I was too busy being mad to actually... appreciate what they were doing. [chuckle] Don't tell anyone I said that.
