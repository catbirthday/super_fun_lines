873 Character A: [wearily] Hey, sorry I'm late. [slower] Had to stop three times on the way here—you know how it is. [soft chuckle] Or actually, you probably don't, which is fine. Just needed extra rest today.
Character B: [enthusiastically] Oh my god, you should try yoga! [getting faster] My instructor says it literally cures everything—anxiety, fatigue, probably cancer too. [excited squeal] I'll send you her Instagram! She has this amazing morning routine that starts at 5 AM.
874 Character A: [strained smile in voice] That's really thoughtful. [pause] [quietly] Though mornings are when my symptoms are worst. [more firmly] I actually work with a whole medical team already, but I appreciate you thinking of me, really.
Character B: [dismissively] But have you tried going gluten-free? [insistent] My cousin's friend totally cured her thing—whatever it was—just by cutting bread! [louder] You're probably just eating wrong. I read this article about inflammation that would blow your mind!
875 Character A: [exhausted sigh] I've tried seventeen different diets actually. [flatly] My condition is genetic, not dietary. [gentler] But speaking of food, how's that new restaurant you mentioned? Did you end up going there last week?
Character B: [brightening] Yes! Amazing tapas! [concerned tone] Though you look tired—are you sleeping enough? [accusatory] You're always on your phone at night. Blue light is toxic, you know. Maybe that's why you feel so bad lately.
876 Character A: [tight voice] I use my phone to track symptoms for my doctors. [measured] And to connect with support groups when I can't leave bed. [softer] Sleep is complicated when you're in pain, but I manage it best I can.
Character B: [skeptically] Support groups sound so depressing though. [cheerfully] You need positive vibes only! [sing-song voice] Mind over matter, babe! Have you tried just not thinking about being sick? The universe responds to what you put out there!
877 Character A: [hollow laugh] Wow, why didn't I think of that? [sarcastically sweet] Just think myself better! [dropping pretense] Look, I know you mean well, but chronic illness doesn't work that way. Can we maybe talk about literally anything else?
Character B: [hurt] I'm just trying to help! [defensive] You never want to try anything new. [whining slightly] My friend Sarah says you have to want to get better. Maybe you're just comfortable being sick? Some people get attached to their identity.
878 Character A: [sharp intake] Comfortable? [voice breaking slightly] I've lost my career, relationships, and independence. [steadier but cold] Nobody chooses this. I fight every single day just to function. Your friend Sarah doesn't know what she's talking about.
Character B: [awkwardly] Oh, I didn't mean... [trailing off] [quickly changing subject] Hey, want to go hiking next weekend? Fresh air would be good for you! [hopefully] We could do that easy trail, only like five miles!
879 Character A: [bitter laugh] Five miles? [incredulous] I can barely manage five minutes standing some days. [sadly] I used to love hiking, remember? Now stairs are my Everest. But thanks for still inviting me to things, even impossible ones.
Character B: [frustrated] Well you never want to do anything anymore! [accusingly] I'm trying here! [softer] Remember when we used to go out every weekend? [wistfully] I miss my fun friend. This isn't who you used to be.
880 Character A: [quietly pained] I miss her too. [stronger] Every single day I mourn who I was. [trembling] But I'm still me, just modified. I need friends who can accept this version, limitations and all. Can you do that?
Character B: [uncomfortable] Of course I accept you! [defensive again] I just think you're not trying hard enough. [pleading] My mom's friend had chronic fatigue and she's fine now! She just needed to push through it and stay positive!
881 Character A: [exhausted whisper] That's not acceptance. [clearer] That's you waiting for me to get "better." [firmly] Some things don't get better. They just get managed. I need you to understand that or this friendship won't survive my illness.
Character B: [quietly] I just don't know what to say anymore. [frustrated whisper] Everything I suggest upsets you. [confused] I'm trying to help but you shoot everything down. How am I supposed to be a good friend if you won't let me?
882 Character A: [gently] Just be here. [warmer] Don't try to fix me. Ask how I am without offering solutions. [hopeful] Adapt plans to include me. Believe me when I tell you my limits. That's all. Just see me, not my potential recovery.
Character B: [long pause] [thoughtfully] Maybe I have been trying to fix instead of just... be. [apologetic] I'm scared of losing you to this thing. [voice cracking] But I'm pushing you away instead, aren't I? Can we start over?
Script: 9bf753a5 | Role: Character B
Character A: [high-pitched squeal] OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! [breathless] Is this really—no way, it can't be the limited edition vinyl collection! [getting louder] Mom and Dad actually found it? This has been sold out everywhere for months!
883 Character B: [shrieking] WAIT, WAIT, WAIT! [trembling] Mine feels like jewelry—oh please be the necklace, please be the necklace! [faster] The weight is perfect, the box size is right, I'm literally shaking right now, I can't even open it properly!
Character A: [whispered excitement] Okay, okay, let's open them at the same time. [building intensity] Ready? One... two... [explosive shout] THREE! YES! IT IS! IT'S THE COMPLETE BEATLES REMASTERED SET! Look at this gorgeous packaging!
884 Character B: [piercing scream] AHHHHH! [sobbing with joy] It's grandmother's sapphire pendant! [quieter, emotional] The one from the estate that I thought was gone forever. How did they even get this? My hands won't stop trembling, this is absolutely insane.
Character A: [choked up] Stop it, you're going to make me cry too! [sniffling] That necklace is stunning on you. [more composed] Hey, there's another box under here with your name—it's suspiciously book-shaped and extremely heavy.
885 Character B: [suspicious tone] No freaking way. [gradually louder] If this is what I think it is... [screech] THE FIRST EDITION HARRY POTTER SET! WITH THE TYPOS! These cost more than my car! Are Mom and Dad completely insane this year?
Character A: [laughing hysterically] We must have been exceptionally good this year! [sarcastically] Or they're buttering us up for something. [nervous giggle] Remember last time they were this generous? They announced they were selling the lake house right after dinner.
886 Character B: [defensive shout] Don't you dare jinx this! [pleading] Let us have this perfect moment! [whispered conspiracy] Though you're right, this is suspicious. Check that envelope tucked behind the tree—it has both our names written on it.
Character A: [reading slowly] "Girls, these gifts are from Aunt Margaret's inheritance." [voice breaking] She left us each ten thousand dollars specifically for... [crying] "something that would make your hearts sing." I can't read anymore through these tears.
887 Character B: [sobbing] That beautiful woman! [hiccupping through tears] She always said life was too short for practical gifts. [soft whisper] Remember how she'd sneak us candy at every family dinner? [louder, emotional] This is so perfectly her!
Character A: [gentle tone] She knew us so well. [more firmly] Your love for rare books, my vinyl obsession. [wistful sigh] Even from beyond, she's still giving the most thoughtful gifts. Should we call Mom and Dad to thank them now?
888 Character B: [wiping tears, sniffling] In a minute. [determined] First, I'm putting on this necklace and you're playing that vinyl. [getting excited again] We're going to have the most epic Christmas morning dance party Aunt Margaret would have absolutely loved!
Character A: [brightening up] Yes! Beatles or Rolling Stones first? [mischievous tone] Actually, no—let's start with her favorite. [shouting] Where's that Ella Fitzgerald Christmas album? The one she played every single December without fail? That's the perfect tribute!
889 Character B: [squealing again] Bottom shelf, red sleeve! [rushed words] I saw it earlier! This necklace catches the tree lights perfectly—she would have loved seeing this. [voice cracking] God, I miss her. These aren't just presents; they're messages from her.
Character A: [reflective whisper] Every Christmas she'd say presents should create memories, not fill closets. [normal volume] She'd be so proud we're crying happy tears. [giggling] Remember when she gave Dad that karaoke machine just to torture him into singing?
890 Character B: [bursting with laughter] He was mortified! [through giggles] But by New Year's Eve he was doing full Elvis impersonations! [more seriously] That woman had gift-giving magic. [softly] I hope we inherited at least a fraction of her thoughtfulness.
Character A: [steady voice] We did—look what you got me last year. [emotional] That signed album that you drove three states to find. [firmly] That's pure Aunt Margaret energy. Speaking of which, should we open the rest or savor this moment?
891 Character B: [dramatically] Savor, definitely savor! [laughing] The other presents can wait—they'll pale in comparison anyway. [excitedly] Get that record player going! I want to dance around in grandmother's necklace like we're in an old Hollywood movie!
Character A: [announcing grandly] Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Chapman sisters' memorial Christmas spectacular! [quieter, loving] Featuring Aunt Margaret's impeccable taste and way too much hot chocolate. [shouting with joy] This is officially the best Christmas morning in the history of everything!
892 Character B: [yelling over music] TURN IT UP LOUDER! [singing badly] Let the whole neighborhood know the Chapman girls are having the time of their lives! [breathlessly happy] Aunt Margaret, wherever you are—[choking up] thank you for still making Christmas magical!

893 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Hello! Welcome to TechMart support, I'm Sarah. [quickly] How can I assist you today with your shopping experience?
Customer: [frustrated] Your website keeps crashing! [groans] I've been trying to buy a laptop for—what—thirty minutes now, and [louder] every single time I hit checkout, the whole thing freezes.
894 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear about that frustration. [briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—can you provide your email, and, um, which browser you're using?
Customer: [exasperated] It's johnson.mike at gmail. [sighs heavily] I've tried Chrome, Firefox... [more angrily] even that ancient Internet Explorer my work computer has, nothing works!
895 Customer Support: [reassuringly] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [more quickly] I'm seeing some, uh, server issues on our end affecting checkout—our tech team is actively working on it right now.
Customer: [sarcastically] Actively working? [scoffs] That's what the error message said an hour ago! [desperately] Look, this laptop deal ends tonight, I need this for work tomorrow.
896 Customer Support: [firmly] I hear you, absolutely. [speaking faster] Here's what I can do—I'll create a special checkout link that bypasses our main server, or, alternatively, I can process your order directly through our backend system.
Customer: [skeptically] A special link? [quieter] That sounds... suspicious. [more forcefully] How do I know this isn't some scam to steal my credit card information?
897 Customer Support: [calmly] That's a perfectly valid concern, sir. [more reassuringly] The link would come from our official domain—techmartcheckout dot com—and, actually, [briskly] I can also offer to call you directly if you prefer phone ordering.
Customer: [sighs] Fine, fine, send the link. [impatiently] But if this doesn't work, I'm just—I'm going to your competitor, [muttering] their site actually functions.
898 Customer Support: [quickly] Sending it right now to your email! [more enthusiastically] Also, for your trouble, I'm adding a fifteen percent discount code—SORRY15—that'll stack with the current sale price.
Customer: [surprised] Oh! [softer] Well, that's... actually pretty decent of you. [cautiously] The link better work though, because my patience is basically nonexistent at this point.
899 Customer Support: [confidently] It should work perfectly, Mr. Johnson. [speaking rapidly] Just click the link, your cart items will be there, enter the discount code at checkout, and you'll be all set within two minutes.
Customer: [relieved] Okay, I got the email and—wait, it's actually loading! [excitedly] The checkout page is working, oh thank God, [chuckles] I was about to throw my computer out the window.
900 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Wonderful! [more quickly] I'll stay on this chat while you complete the purchase, just in case you need anything else, any questions at all.
Customer: [typing sounds should not be included] The discount applied and... [triumphantly] yes! Order confirmed! [gratefully] Sarah, you just saved my presentation tomorrow, seriously.
901 Customer Support: [warmly] That's fantastic, Mr. Johnson! [briskly] You'll receive a confirmation email shortly with tracking information, and expedited shipping is already applied due to our website issues.
Customer: [appreciatively] Free expedited shipping too? [chuckles softly] You know what, I take back every curse word I muttered about TechMart in the last hour—well, [playfully] most of them anyway.
902 Customer Support: [laughing] I'm just glad we could turn this around for you! [more professionally] Is there anything else I can help you with today, any other concerns about your order?
Customer: [contentedly] Nope, all good now. [sincerely] Thanks again Sarah, you're definitely getting a five-star review for this—[more quietly] assuming the laptop actually arrives tomorrow, of course.

903 Customer Support: Carbon Safety Solutions, this is Marcus. I need your account number to access your system details.
Customer: Oh god, it's—it's beeping like crazy, won't stop! My account is, um, wait—C-S-9-9-4-3-A, and I don't know what to do here.
904 Customer Support: Account CS9943A confirmed. What's the model number on your detector, should be on the back starting with CM?
Customer: It says—hold on, I'm trying to read it while it's screaming at me—CM dash 7-7-2-X-L. Started about ten minutes ago, just constant beeping, and my kids are freaking out.
905 Customer Support: CM-772XL unit logged. How many beeps in a pattern—four beeps then pause, or five beeps then pause?
Customer: It's, uh, definitely four beeps, then like a five second break, then four again. Should I—should we be evacuating or something right now?
906 Customer Support: Four beeps indicates end-of-life warning, not active detection. Your unit's manufacture date shows November 2016, serial J-K-2-2-8-9-1, which means it needs replacement.
Customer: Oh thank god, so we're not gonna die? But how do I make it stop—it's driving us absolutely insane and I can't find any button that works.
907 Customer Support: Press and hold the test button for fifteen seconds to silence it temporarily. I'm generating replacement order R-O-5-5-6-2 for expedited shipping to your zip ending in 3-8-1.
Customer: Okay, holding it now—oh blessed silence, finally! So when's the new one coming, because I'm paranoid we won't have protection until then.
908 Customer Support: Tracking number T-X-9-9-4-4-7-B shows delivery tomorrow before noon. Keep your current unit connected until the replacement arrives, it still detects gas despite the warning.
Customer: Tomorrow's perfect, that's—that's such a relief actually. Do I need to, like, call someone to install it or can I just swap them myself?
909 Customer Support: Simple swap, just twist counterclockwise to remove, match the mounting bracket. Your warranty extension code is W-A-R-2-2-5-5 if you need future support.
Customer: Got it, writing that down—W-A-R-2-2-5-5. One more thing though, how often should these things get replaced anyway, so I don't get startled like this again?
910 Customer Support: Seven years for all units, your new one will auto-remind via app. Case number C-M-8-8-3-3-9 documents this call if you need reference.
Customer: Perfect, I'll set a reminder too just in case—November 2031, right? And should I keep the old one for recycling or just trash it?
911 Customer Support: Correct on the date. Check your email for disposal form D-F-3-3-2-1, includes three authorized drop-off locations within your 3-8-1 area code.
Customer: Just got the email, yep, there's a place like two miles away. You've been super helpful Marcus, way better than I expected for a panic call.
912 Customer Support: Glad I could help. Confirmation text with order R-O-5-5-6-2 and tracking details will arrive within ten minutes to your phone ending in 7-7-4.
Customer: That's my number alright—thanks again, seriously. At least now I can tell my family we're safe and the beeping nightmare ends tomorrow morning!
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---
913 [Fast] Oh my god, um, hi—I didn't, I didn't see you there, or I mean, I did, but like— [Nervous laugh] [Happy] wow, you're actually talking to me right now. [Whisper] Is this really happening or am I just, y'know, imagining things again? [Slow] Because honestly I've kinda rehearsed this moment about a thousand times. [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm totally fine, it's not like my heart's gonna explode or anything. [Chuckle] Just, uh, casual Tuesday conversation stuff. [Happy] Wait, you actually remember my name? [Fast] That's—I mean, of course you do, we've had like three classes together, but still! [Disappointed] [Sigh] And here I thought I was gonna be all smooth and confident, but instead I'm just... this mess. [Slow] You know what's funny? [Tsk] I literally had a whole speech prepared for if you ever talked to me, and now it's just—gone. [Angry] Why does my brain have to shut down right now of all times? [Groan] I swear I usually know how to form actual sentences. [Whisper] Don't look directly at their eyes, don't look—okay, I'm looking. [Fast] [Happy] Wow, has anyone ever told you your eyes are like, ridiculously pretty? [Shout] What? [Laugh] No, sorry, I didn't mean to yell, you just caught me off guard asking about the homework! [Sad] I'm probably making such a fool of myself right now, aren't I? [Slow] Like, you're being nice but I can tell I'm being weird. [Fast] So basically what you're saying is—wait, did you just invite me to sit with you? [Happy] [Chuckle] That's, um, yeah, absolutely, I'd love that! [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just pretend my palms aren't sweating like crazy right now. [Tsk] Very attractive, I know. [Disappointed] I had this whole plan to be mysterious and interesting, but instead I just told you about my pet hamster's medical problems. [Groan] [Happy] You actually think I'm funny? [Slow] Nobody's ever—I mean, wow, that's really... [Laugh] thanks, that means a lot coming from you. [Angry] [Fast] My friends are literally watching us from across the room and I'm gonna kill them later for being so obvious about it. [Whisper] Please don't notice that I'm shaking a little bit. [Sigh] [Sad] This is exactly why I usually just admire you from afar, y'know? [Shout] Yes! [Fast] [Happy] I mean—sorry, yes, I would definitely wanna study together sometime, that sounds amazing! [Slow] Um, can I just say something? [Tsk] You smell really good and it's kinda distracting me from whatever we're talking about. [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Great, now I'm gonna replay this entire conversation in my head for the next three weeks, analyzing every single word. [Disappointed] Wait, you're leaving already? [Fast] But we just—I mean, okay, yeah, see you around then, I guess.
914 [Happy] Oh my god, this is—wow, I actually look like a completely different person! [Laugh] Is that really me? [Disappointed] I, uh, I specifically said not too short on the sides, and this is... [Sigh] this is basically a buzzcut. [Whisper] Um, can you maybe—actually, could we fix the back a little bit? [Slow] It's kinda sticking up in a weird way. [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, this is exactly what I wanted when I showed you that picture. [Tsk] Totally identical. [Fast] Wait wait wait, turn me around again, I wanna see the—oh that's actually pretty cool how it layers like that! [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I have a wedding tomorrow and you've given me THIS? [Sad] It's just, like, I've been growing it out for three years and now it's all... [Slow] gone, y'know? [Happy] [Chuckle] My mom is gonna freak when she sees this—in a good way, I mean, she's been begging me to cut it. [Whisper] [Fast] Honestly, I dunno if I can pull this off, it's so different from what I usually— [Disappointed] I guess it'll grow back, right? [Sigh] Like, how long do you think until it's, um, normal again? [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh sure, because when I said "just a trim," I obviously meant take off six inches. [Happy] This is literally—I can't even explain how much lighter my head feels! [Laugh] [Fast] It's like I was carrying around a blanket before! [Angry] [Groan] I'm not paying full price for this disaster, okay? [Slow] You know what, actually... [Happy] the more I look at it, the more I kinda love it? [Sad] [Whisper] Can you, uh, can you maybe style it differently so it doesn't look so—I dunno, so severe? [Fast] [Disappointed] My boyfriend specifically said he likes long hair and I went and—ugh, what was I thinking? [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Well, at least I won't need to buy shampoo for a while with basically no hair left. [Shout] Holy crap! [Happy] [Fast] I look like that actress from that show—what's her name—this is incredible! [Slow] I mean, it's not bad, it's just... [Tsk] [Sigh] it's gonna take some getting used to, I guess. [Angry] [Fast] Do you have any idea how much I paid for those highlights last month that you just cut off?

SCENARIO: Casually mentioning they need to move their car, then checking the time, then realizing street cleaning already happened and they definitely have a ticket, ending in resigned financial frustration
[casual]
Oh, I should probably move my car later. Street cleaning's today on my block, you know how it is. I think it's at like... two? Two-thirty? Something like that.
[conversational]
I've been pretty good about it lately, actually. Like, I used to get nailed all the time when I first moved to that neighborhood. But now I have this little system where I— [pause] wait, what time is it right now?
[slight concern]
It's... oh. It's three-fifteen. [nervous laugh] Okay, that's— that's probably not great. But maybe they haven't gotten to my street yet? Sometimes they run late, right?
[growing worry]
Actually, you know what, they usually start on the north end and work down, and I'm pretty much right in the middle, so... [trailing off] Yeah, no, they've definitely been by already.
[realization setting in]
[sigh] Oh god, there's definitely a ticket on my windshield right now. I can just picture it. That stupid little envelope, probably flapping in the wind like a tiny flag of my failure as a responsible adult.
[frustrated]
And it's what, like seventy-five bucks now? For street cleaning? [scoff] Seventy-five dollars because I can't keep track of what day it is!
[exasperated] [building to peak]
Ugh, I swear this city is just designed to bleed you dry! Every week it's something! Parking tickets, meter fees, permit renewals— [huff] I'm basically paying rent twice at this point! This is insane!

SCENARIO: Mad about an early alarm, then remembering they set it for something exciting
[irritated]
Oh my god, I am so— I'm so tired right now. My alarm went off at like 5:30 this morning and I was just like, are you kidding me? Like who— who does that to themselves on a Tuesday?
[frustrated] [groggy]
I'm lying there in the dark just like, why, why would I set this thing so early, this is— this is insane. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck or something. [groan] And I'm just fumbling around trying to find the snooze button but it just keeps going off.
[annoyed]
I was so mad at myself, like genuinely angry, just like stomping around my apartment being like, this is the worst decision I've ever— wait. Wait, hold on.
[suddenly remembering] [excited]
Oh my god, the tickets! The concert tickets go on sale at 6 AM! [laugh] Oh wow, I'm an idiot, I totally— I completely forgot why I set that alarm.
[energetic] [slightly embarrassed]
I was literally cursing my past self for like twenty minutes and then I remembered— it's for that band you introduced me to? The one we saw that video of? Yeah, I've been wanting to see them forever and tickets always sell out in like minutes.
[proud] [happy]
And guess what? I got them! Two tickets, actually. [chuckle] So um, you free next month?

SCENARIO: Upset about a disappointing sequel, then the ending redeeming everything
[frustrated]
Oh my God, I am so— I'm so mad right now. I just got back from seeing the new Crimson Dawn movie and it was like, it was awful. Like genuinely terrible.
[annoyed]
They completely ruined everything that made the first one good, you know? The characters are all wrong, the plot makes no sense, and don't even get me started on what they did to Marcus's storyline. It's like they didn't even watch the original.
[getting worked up]
I waited three years for this sequel. Three years! And they just— [scoff] they just threw it all away for some generic action garbage that could've been any movie. I'm so disappointed I could actually cry right now.
[bitter]
And the ending was so rushed and stupid, I was literally checking my phone to see when it would be over, and I was like— wait. Wait, hold on.
[confused] [slower]
Actually... thinking about it now, that last scene with Sarah and the, um, the callback to her father's letter? That was... that was actually really beautiful. Like really, really well done.
[thoughtful] [warming up]
Oh God, and when Marcus showed up at the very end? [small laugh] I think I was so angry about the middle part that I almost missed how perfect that moment was. That look they shared, and the music...
[sheepish] [fond]
Okay maybe I need to see it again. Maybe I was too busy being mad to actually... appreciate what they were doing. [chuckle] Don't tell anyone I said that.
