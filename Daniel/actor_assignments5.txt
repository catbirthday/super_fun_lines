Character 1: Finally done with the bathroom.
294 Character 2: Oh my god, wait—the bathroom? You actually finished it? I thought you were gonna be working on that thing until like, I dunno, next year or something!
Character 1: Three months. Every weekend.
295 Character 2: Three months of—okay that's actually that's dedication. Was it the tiling that took forever? Because I remember you saying the tiling was gonna be a nightmare.
Character 1: Everything took forever. The plumbing almost broke me.
296 Character 2: No no no, hold on—you did the plumbing yourself? Like, actual pipes and water and stuff? That's... honestly that's kinda terrifying. I can barely change a shower head without flooding something.
Character 1: YouTube University.
297 Character 2: Stop it. You learned plumbing from YouTube? That's—I mean, that's either really brave or really stupid and I can't decide which.
Character 1: Both. Definitely both.
298 Character 2: Okay but like, how does it look though? Are we talking, y'know, Pinterest-worthy or more like... functional but questionable?
Character 1: It's good. Really good, actually.
299 Character 2: Wait wait wait—did you just, did you just compliment your own work? That's huge! You never—you literally never say stuff like that about anything you do.
Character 1: Well. The tile lines are straight. Mostly.
300 Character 2: Mostly? No, uh-uh, we're not doing the self-deprecating thing right now. You basically built an entire bathroom from scratch, right? That's like—that's incredible.
Character 1: My back disagrees.
301 Character 2: Oh god, yeah, I bet you're just... completely destroyed. Have you been like, living on ibuprofen? Because honestly after my tiny kitchen backsplash I was basically immobile for a week.
Character 1: Ibuprofen and regret.
302 Character 2: Okay but—but you're done now! You're actually done! We should like, I dunno, celebrate or something? Get drinks and you can tell me about all the times you almost gave up?
Character 1: There were many.
303 Character 2: I mean, yeah, obviously—but you didn't! You finished it! That's... honestly that's really something. Most people would've just hired someone after week two.
Script: 55f86a30_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: So. They approved it.
304 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? They approved—oh my god, are you saying what I think you're saying? The adoption? They actually—they said yes?
Character 1: Got the call this morning.
305 Character 2: I'm gonna cry. Like, I'm literally about to— how are you so calm right now? This is huge! This is like, this is everything you've been waiting for!
Character 1: I don't think it's hit me yet.
306 Character 2: Okay, yeah, no that's—that's totally normal. You've been in this process for what, like two years? And now suddenly it's just... happening? God, I can't even imagine.
Character 1: Two and a half years. But who's counting.
307 Character 2: Right, of course, who's— okay but seriously though, when do you meet them? Do you have pictures? I need, like, I need all the details right now.
Character 1: Next Tuesday. And yeah. One picture.
308 Character 2: Next Tuesday? That's—wait that's like five days! Oh my god, are you ready? I mean, nobody's ever really ready but like... how're you feeling?
Character 1: Terrified.
309 Character 2: Oh babe, of course you are. That's so—I mean, you're about to become a parent, y'know? That's gotta be the scariest, most amazing thing ever.
Character 1: What if I mess it up?
310 Character 2: Okay no no no, stop. You're not gonna—listen, the fact that you're even worried about that? That already makes you a good parent. Like, bad parents don't worry about being bad parents, right?
Character 1: I bought seventeen parenting books yesterday. Seventeen.
311 Character 2: Seven— okay that's actually adorable though. You're gonna be that parent who like, researches everything and has spreadsheets for playdates, aren't you?
Character 1: Already made the spreadsheet.
312 Character 2: Of course you did! But honestly? This kid—they're so lucky. Like, they're getting someone who fought for them for two and a half years, y'know? That's... that's love already.
Character 1: Yeah. Maybe.
313 Character 2: Not maybe—definitely. And I'm gonna be the most extra aunt or uncle, just so you know. I'm talking like, spoiling them rotten, sugar highs, the whole thing. You can't stop me.
Script: 6458ca1d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: You called my mom.
314 Character 2: I was worried about you! You weren't answering anyone's texts for like three days, and I—I thought something was wrong. I was trying to help.
Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.
315 Character 2: Okay okay, but you're acting like I just randomly decided to—look, you've been going through it lately, and I didn't know what else to do. Sorry for caring, I guess.
Character 1: You went behind my back.
316 Character 2: That's not—I mean, technically yeah, but it's not like I was trying to be sneaky about it. I literally thought you might be, I dunno, hurt or something. You can't just disappear and expect people not to worry.
Character 1: I needed space. That's all.
317 Character 2: And how was I supposed to know that? You didn't tell me you needed space, you just—you just vanished. I'm not a mind reader, y'know?
Character 1: So you tattled to my mother?
318 Character 2: Tattled? Seriously? That's—we're not in third grade here. I reached out because I was legitimately concerned. But fine, next time you wanna ghost everyone, maybe send a heads up first.
Character 1: There won't be a next time.
319 Character 2: What's that supposed to mean? Look look, I get that you're pissed, but come on—this is a little extreme, don't you think?
Character 1: You crossed a line.
320 Character 2: I was trying to—okay, fine, maybe I crossed a line. But you're acting like I did it to hurt you, and that's just... that's not what happened. I thought I was helping.
Character 1: You made everything worse.
321 Character 2: How was I supposed to know your mom would freak out like that? I'm not—I can't predict the future. I just told her you hadn't been responding, that's literally all I said.
Character 1: Right. Just that.
322 Character 2: Okay, and maybe I mentioned you'd been stressed about work, but— look, I'm sorry it turned into a whole thing, alright? But honestly? You kinda put me in an impossible position here.
Character 1: I didn't put you anywhere.
323 Character 2: You're right, you didn't. You just disappeared and left everyone else to figure out if you were okay. But sure, I'm the bad guy for actually giving a shit.
Script: a563bdfb_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: This is the third time this month.
324 Character 2: I know, I know, I'm literally the worst friend ever. Something came up with my mom and I—wait, that sounds like an excuse. It's not an excuse, I swear, she actually needed me to drive her to—
Character 1: You could have texted earlier.
325 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right. I kept thinking I could make it work, y'know? Like maybe if I hurried I could still—but then time just got away from me and suddenly it was already seven.
Character 1: I was already at the restaurant.
326 Character 2: Oh god. Oh no no no, you were—you were already there? I didn't... I thought we were meeting at eight, not—wait, was it seven-thirty? Oh my god, I'm such an idiot.
Character 1: Twenty minutes. In the rain.
327 Character 2: I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, completely sorry. I know I keep doing this and it's—it's not fair to you. At all. I don't even know why you still make plans with me honestly because I keep screwing them up.
Character 1: Yeah. You do.
328 Character 2: I wanna make it up to you. Please? Like, tomorrow—no wait, you have that thing. This weekend? I'll plan everything, I'll pick you up, my treat, the whole thing. And I promise—I mean really actually promise this time—that I won't cancel.
Character 1: You promised last time too.
329 Character 2: I did. I know I did. And the time before that, and—god, I'm like that boy who cried wolf, right? Except it's the girl who cried "emergency." But I mean it this time. I'm gonna put like five alarms in my phone.
Character 1: I don't know if I believe you anymore.
330 Character 2: That's— that's fair. That's completely fair. I wouldn't believe me either. But you're like, one of my favorite people, y'know? And I keep messing this up because I'm terrible at time management and I always think I can do more than I actually can.
Character 1: It makes me feel like I don't matter.
331 Character 2: No! No, you matter so much. You matter—god, I'm making you feel like that? That's the last thing I ever wanted. You're literally—you're so important to me. I'm just really, really bad at showing it apparently.
Character 1: Actions speak louder than words, you know.
332 Character 2: They do. They totally do. And my actions have been saying that I'm a flaky, unreliable friend who doesn't—who doesn't value your time. But that's not true, I swear it's not. I just get overwhelmed and then I handle it badly.
Character 1: Fine. One more chance. But this is it.
333 Character 2: Really? You'll—oh thank god. Thank you. I promise I won't mess this up. Saturday, two o'clock, that new place you wanted to try? I'm gonna be there at like 1:45. Early! Can you imagine? Me, early? But I will be. I promise.

SCENARIO: a kid named Amelia learns to ride a bike without training wheels
[encouraging but nervous]
Okay, so, um, so we're doing this. We're actually doing this today. The, uh, the training wheels are off and Amelia's just— she's just staring at the bike like it's gonna, I don't know, like it's gonna bite her or something. [nervous laugh] Which, I mean, I get it, I totally get it.
[muttering to self]
Alright, so I just— I just need to hold the back of the seat, right? That's what my dad did with me, I think. Or was it the, um, was it the handlebars? No, that doesn't— that doesn't seem right.
[slightly more confident]
Okay, seat. Definitely the seat. And then I just, uh, I just run alongside her and then at some point I let go and she— well, hopefully she doesn't just immediately crash into Mrs. Peterson's rose bushes. [sigh]
[brightening]
But she's got this, though. I mean, she's been asking about it for weeks, so she's— she's ready, right? She's totally ready.
[trailing off uncertainly]
I think she's ready. I hope she's, um, I hope she's ready...

SCENARIO: a writer named Elena holds the first copy of her published novel
[breathless, slightly awed]
Oh my god, okay, so this is— this is it. This is actually, um, this is actually my book. Like, my book book. With my name on it and everything. [nervous laugh] I mean, I knew it was coming, obviously, but seeing it here, like, physically here in my hands is just— it's so weird.
[muttering, flipping through]
The cover looks good, right? I think it looks— I mean, I hope it looks good. God, what if there's a typo on the first page? What if there's a typo on every page? [anxious laugh] No, no, that's— that's not gonna happen, Elena. They have editors for a reason.
[quieter, more tender]
"Chapter One." Wow. There it is. I remember writing this part at, um, at like two in the morning, drinking terrible coffee and thinking this was all garbage. And now it's— now it's real. It's a real thing that people can buy.
[slightly panicked]
Wait, people are gonna read this. Like, actual people. Strangers. Oh god, what if they hate it? What if— [sigh] okay, okay, one crisis at a time, Elena.
[trailing off, dreamy]
But still... my book. Huh.

Script: ecdf98cb | Role: Character B
Character A: [Screaming] WE GOT IT! WE GOT THE MORRISON ACCOUNT! [jumping up and down] Three years of pitching, and they finally said yes! [voice cracking with joy] I can't believe this is actually happening right now!
336 Character B: [Shrieking] SHUT UP, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! [gasping] Wait, wait, THE Morrison Industries? [getting louder] The fifty-million-dollar contract Morrison?! My hands are literally shaking—look at them shake! This is insane!
Character A: [Breathless] I just got off the phone with their CEO! [squealing] She loved our sustainability angle! [more excited] Remember when everyone said we were crazy for that green initiative pivot? WHO'S CRAZY NOW?!
337 Character B: [Hysterical laughter] We're buying champagne—the expensive stuff! [yelling] JANET! JANET, COME HERE! [voice breaking] We just became the agency that landed the whale everyone's been chasing since 2019!
Character A: [Quieter, trembling] My mom didn't believe in this company. [building volume] She said I should've stayed at my corporate job. [explosive] LOOK AT US NOW, MOM! We're about to expand to three new offices!
338 Character B: [Whispered awe] Do you realize what this means? [normal volume] We can finally hire that dream team we mapped out. [shouting gleefully] No more sixteen-hour days doing everything ourselves! Actual employees! Real desks!
Character A: [Sobbing with joy] I haven't slept properly in six months. [sniffling] All those rejected proposals, the failed pitches... [triumphant yell] Every single "no" led us to this massive, beautiful, life-changing YES!
339 Character B: [Rapid words] Quick, quick, we need to call everyone—the lawyers, accounting, our families! [slowing down] Wait, should we sit down first? [giggling uncontrollably] I think I might faint from all this screaming and jumping!
Character A: [Sing-song voice] We're getting bonuses, we're getting bonuses! [normally] Remember eating ramen for three months straight? [roaring] GOODBYE INSTANT NOODLES, HELLO MICHELIN STARS! This is our moment! Our actual moment!
340 Character B: [Hoarse whisper] My voice is almost gone from screaming. [louder] But I don't even care because WE DID IT! [raspily yelling] Five years of bootstrap startup life just paid off monumentally!
Character A: [Incredulous] They want us to start next Monday. [panicked excitement] NEXT MONDAY! That's four days away! [determined shout] We need to hire twenty people, like, yesterday! This is beautifully terrifying!
341 Character B: [Cackling] Remember when that investor laughed us out of his office? [mockingly] "Too ambitious," he said! [victorious scream] I'm sending him a photo of this contract with a giant smiley face!
Character A: [Shaky voice] I keep thinking I'm dreaming. [firmly] But the email is right here—it's real. [overwhelming joy] Our tiny startup just beat out three Fortune 500 companies. David just destroyed Goliath!
342 Character B: [Whimpering happily] My dad's going to cry when I tell him. [getting emotional] He mortgaged his house to help fund us. [weeping] Now we can pay him back triple! With interest! Today!
Character A: [Hushed intensity] This changes everything—our lives, our futures. [building up] No more wondering if we'll make rent! [exploding] WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FORBES! The "Thirty Under Thirty" list, here we come!
343 Character B: [Squeaking] My throat hurts so much from screaming! [raspily] But who cares?! [croaking loudly] We need to document this moment—where's your phone? Future us needs to remember this feeling forever!
Character A: [Giddy] The entire floor probably thinks we've lost our minds. [louder] Let them think whatever they want! [bellowing] WE JUST MADE COMPANY HISTORY! Ten years from now, they'll tell stories about today!
344 Character B: [Breathlessly] Stop, stop, I need water before I completely lose my voice. [urgently] But first—group hug! [muffled yelling] This is the best day of our entire professional lives, no question!
Character A: [Softly reverent] We actually pulled it off. [growing stronger] All those people who believed in us were right. [joyful sob] I'm so proud of us—we're going to change this entire industry forever.
345 Character B: [Exhausted whisper] I have no voice left, my legs are jelly. [faintly] But my heart is so full it might explode. [barely audible] We did it, partner. We actually, truly, magnificently did it.
Script: e7d815b8 | Role: Character A
346 Character A: [shaky breath] We did it, Sarah. [voice breaking] That baby—she's alive because of us. [quiet sob] I honestly thought we were going to lose them both when the cord wrapped around her neck like that.
Character B: [through tears] Twenty-three years I've been doing this, and my hands have never shaken like that. [wavering] When she finally cried... [relieved exhale] God, I've never heard a more beautiful sound in my entire life.
347 Character A: [sniffling] The mother kept asking if her baby was okay, and I couldn't speak. [more steadily] I just nodded like an idiot. [soft laugh] How do you tell someone their child almost didn't make it but now she's perfect?
Character B: [hushed tone] You don't. [firmly] You just hand them their miracle. [voice cracking again] Did you see the father's face when he held her? He looked at us like we were angels or something extraordinary.
348 Character A: [bitter laugh] Angels? I felt completely helpless for those three minutes. [faster, panicked] No doctor available, hemorrhaging wouldn't stop, and that tiny heart rate dropping—dropping—dropping. [whispered] I almost called it. I almost gave up on them.
Character B: [gently] But you didn't give up, and that's what matters here. [building emotion] We worked together, trusted our training, trusted each other. [choking up] That little girl is going to grow up because you didn't quit.
349 Character A: [exhausted whisper] I keep replaying it in my mind though. [more intensely] What if we'd been thirty seconds slower? [ragged breath] What if my hands had slipped when I was turning her? These what-ifs are killing me.
Character B: [sharp inhale] Stop that right now. We can't live in the what-ifs. [softer] We live in the what-is. [triumphant whisper] And what is—is a healthy baby girl, breathing and pink and absolutely beautiful.
350 Character A: [laughing through tears] You're right, you're absolutely right. [amazed] Six pounds, four ounces of pure fighter. [quieter] When she grabbed my pinky finger in that tiny fist, I completely lost it. She's so strong already.
Character B: [warmly] That's when I started crying too. [chuckling] Here we are, two professional nurses, sobbing like babies ourselves. [deep breath] My makeup is probably running down to my chin right now, isn't it?
351 Character A: [giggling] You look like a raccoon, honestly. [more seriously] But a raccoon who just saved two lives. [proud whisper] I'd work with you through a thousand emergencies, Sarah. You were absolutely incredible in there today.
Character B: [touched] Don't make me cry harder! [playfully scolding] We both know you're the one who noticed the cord compression first. [earnestly] Your quick thinking gave us those precious extra seconds we desperately needed to save her.
352 Character A: [thoughtfully] It's moments like these that remind me why I became a nurse. [building enthusiasm] Not the paperwork, not the difficult families, but this—this pure joy. [breathless] Knowing we made the ultimate difference for someone today.
Character B: [wistful] I needed this reminder too, especially after last month's loss. [steadier] Sometimes this job breaks your heart into pieces. [hopeful whisper] But today? Today it put all those pieces back together again somehow.
353 Character A: [suddenly urgent] Oh God, we should probably get back in there! [panicking slightly] We've been crying in this supply closet for ten minutes! [nervous laugh] The charge nurse is going to wonder where we disappeared to.
Character B: [dismissively] Let her wonder for another minute. [firmly] We earned this cry, damn it. [gentler] Besides, that wonderful family needs us composed, not looking like we've been through a hurricane.
354 Character A: [sighing deeply] You're right as always. [determined] Let me just fix my face and pull myself together. [watery laugh] Can't have the parents thinking we were out here crying over their baby.
Character B: [tenderly] Why not? It means we care deeply about what we do. [stronger] Every baby matters to us. [emotional whisper] Their daughter mattered enough to make two veteran nurses cry happy tears today.
355 Character A: [gratefully] Thank you for being there with me through all of that insanity. [meaningfully] Having you as my partner made everything possible. [quiet pride] We're a pretty amazing team when crisis hits, aren't we?
Character B: [joyfully] The absolute best team, I'd say. [taking deep breath] Now come here and give me a proper hug. [laughing] Then we'll go meet that miracle baby again—with dry eyes this time!

Script: 723bd428 | Role: Customer Support
356 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling MegaView TV support. [more quickly] My name is Sarah, how can I assist you today?
Customer: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I'm missing like half my channels. [groans] Yesterday everything was fine, but today—nothing. [more angrily] I'm paying for the premium package here!
357 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. [briskly] Let me just pull up your account real quick—can I have your account number or the phone number associated with the service?
Customer: [sighs heavily] It's, uh, 555-0182. [sarcastically] You know, the same number I've had for five years without any issues until now.
358 Customer Support: [quickly] Perfect, I've got your account here, Mr. Johnson. [more carefully] I see you have our Ultimate Plus package—let me just run a diagnostic on your connection.
Customer: [impatiently] Look, I already unplugged the box, waited thirty seconds, plugged it back in. [more loudly] Still missing ESPN, HBO, and basically everything worth watching!
359 Customer Support: [reassuringly] I understand your frustration, sir. [more quickly] The diagnostic shows there's actually a service interruption in your area—our techs are working on it. [apologetically] Should be resolved within two to three hours.
Customer: [outraged] Two to three hours?! [incredulously] I've got people coming over for the game tonight! This is—this is unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.
360 Customer Support: [calmly] I completely understand, Mr. Johnson. [speaking faster] As compensation for this inconvenience, I can offer you a twenty-dollar credit on your next bill, plus a free preview weekend of our sports package.
Customer: [skeptically] Twenty dollars? [chuckles bitterly] That's it? I'm paying a hundred and fifty a month and you're offering me twenty bucks?
361 Customer Support: [more firmly] Let me speak with my supervisor—one moment. [briskly] Actually, I can authorize up to fifty dollars credit, plus we'll upgrade you to our premium sports tier free for three months.
Customer: [sighs] Fine, I guess that's... something. [resignedly] But if this happens again, I'm switching to StreamFlix or whatever. [muttering] My neighbor never has these problems.
362 Customer Support: [quickly] I've applied those credits to your account right now. [more warmly] Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Johnson?
Customer: [tiredly] Just—just make sure those channels come back. [pause] Actually, wait, how do I know when they're working again?
363 Customer Support: [helpfully] Your box will automatically refresh once service is restored. [speaking rapidly] You'll see a quick reboot, maybe thirty seconds of a blue screen, then everything should pop right back up.
Customer: [doubtfully] It better. [more quietly] I mean, I appreciate the credits and all, but I just want what I'm paying for, you know?
364 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Absolutely, and that's completely reasonable. [reassuringly] Our technical team is prioritizing this issue—it's affecting several customers in your area.
Customer: [curious] Several customers? [groans] So it's not just me then. Why didn't anyone notify us about this?
365 Customer Support: [apologetically] We should have sent an alert, you're right. [more quickly] I'm making a note on your account to ensure you're enrolled in our service notifications going forward—text and email both.
Customer: [resigned] Yeah, okay, do that. [sighs] Thanks, Sarah. I guess I'll just... wait and hope for the best here.

366 Customer Support: Password manager support, this is Marcus. Can I have your account email or customer ID to get started?
Customer: Yeah, um, the ID is—wait, let me find it—okay, it's P-W-M-dash-8-8-3-4-2-A. But look, I don't understand what this 2FA thing even is or why it's suddenly blocking me.
367 Customer Support: I see your account, PWM-88342A. Your two-factor authentication was enabled last Tuesday at 3:47 PM. Are you not receiving the codes to your phone ending in 7-2-9?
Customer: Codes? What codes? I just—I don't get why I need codes when I already have a password, isn't that the whole point of a password manager?
368 Customer Support: Two-factor adds extra security by sending a 6-digit code to verify it's really you. Check your SMS messages for a code starting with V-K-dash.
Customer: SMS, you mean like text messages? But why—I mean, my password is already forty characters long with symbols and everything, so this seems completely redundant and unnecessary.
369 Customer Support: I understand your frustration. Let me generate a backup code for you: B-K-P-dash-7-7-2-1-9-5. Can you try entering that in the authentication field?
Customer: Where's the authentication field though? All I see is—there's just a spinning circle and something about "awaiting token" whatever that means, reference number E-R-R-4-4-1.
370 Customer Support: That error means the code expired. I'm sending a new one to your email on file, the one ending in at-gmail-dot-com. Check for subject line "Security Code S-C-9-9-0-1."
Customer: But if someone hacks my email, can't they just—wouldn't they get the code too? This whole system makes absolutely no logical sense to me whatsoever.
371 Customer Support: Valid concern, which is why I recommend switching to an authenticator app. Download one and I'll give you the setup key: Q-R-S-dash-5-5-8-8-T-T-4.
Customer: An app to get into my app? This is—I mean, what happens if I lose my phone or it breaks or something?
372 Customer Support: That's what recovery codes are for. I'll generate ten codes for you now. First one is R-C-V-dash-1-0-0-2-3. Do you have somewhere secure to write these?
Customer: Write them down, but then—if I'm writing down codes, isn't that just like writing down passwords, which everyone says never to do?
373 Customer Support: These are one-time emergency codes only, stored offline. Meanwhile, I see you're logged in successfully now using code V-K-7-7-2-1-9-5. Is that correct?
Customer: Wait, I am? But I didn't—oh, that's what that number did? I thought it was just an error code or something.
374 Customer Support: Yes, that was your access code. I'm creating case number C-S-T-dash-0-9-8-7-6 for future reference. Would you like me to walk through setting up the authenticator app?
Customer: I guess, but—why can't I just use my fingerprint like everything else on my phone does these days instead of all these numbers?
375 Customer Support: Biometric login is available in settings under Security Tab S-T-dash-0-0-3. You'll need to complete one more verification with code M-F-A-9-9-8 first though.
Customer: Fine, okay, but if this locks me out again—actually, you know what, maybe just leave it how it is now, I don't want to mess anything else up.

376 [Sad] Oh no, oh no, oh no—I can't believe I just... [Slow] that was your grandmother's, wasn't it? [Sigh] [Fast] Okay so maybe we can, like, glue it back together and nobody has to know? [Nervous] [Laugh] [Whisper] Did anyone else hear that? [Tsk] Maybe if I just, um, quietly sweep this up... [Angry] This is what happens when you leave expensive stuff just lying around! [Groan] I mean—sorry, that came out wrong. [Shout] Don't move! [Fast] There's glass everywhere and I gotta—just stay there while I get the broom! [Disappointed] I literally just told myself to be careful, and then I go and—ugh, I'm such an idiot. [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Well, there goes my entire paycheck. [Tsk] Hope you weren't, like, super attached to that thing or anything. [Slow] You know what, I'm gonna be honest with you... [Sad] I don't even know how that happened, it just sorta slipped. [Happy] Hey, at least now you have an excuse to get a new one, right? [Chuckle] I'm kidding—I'll pay for it! [Fast] It wasn't me—I mean, okay, it was me, but the cat startled me and I just—my hand kinda jerked! [Groan] [Whisper] Please tell me that wasn't the original. [Disappointed] [Slow] Please, please tell me you have insurance on this thing. [Angry] Why would you even own something this fragile?! [Sigh] Sorry, I'm just—I'm freaking out a little here, okay? [Sad] [Slow] I, um, I think I need to sit down for a minute because that sounded really expensive when it broke. [Sarcastic] Sure, just put the priceless antique right next to the doorway—what could possibly go wrong? [Tsk] [Fast] Apparently, me. I could go wrong. [Shout] Nobody panic! [Laugh] I mean, I'm panicking, but like, you don't have to! [Disappointed] This is literally the worst timing—your parents are coming over tomorrow and now I've gone and... [Groan] [Slow] I've really messed up. [Happy] Look at it this way, we're gonna have such a funny story about this in like ten years! [Chuckle] Maybe five? [Fast] [Angry] I told you not to make me carry it—I said I was gonna drop it and you were all "no, you won't!" [Whisper] [Sad] Do you think if we just, er, put the pieces in a box, we could find someone who fixes these? [Slow] So, hypothetically speaking, how mad would you be if—actually, never mind, you can see what happened. [Sigh] [Disappointed] I'll get my checkbook.
377 [Happy] Oh my god, these are—wait, are these actually for me? [Laugh] I mean, nobody's ever sent me flowers before, this is kinda crazy! [Whisper] Do you think it's, um, do you think it's someone from work? [Slow] Because I've been getting these weird vibes from accounting lately. [Sarcastic] Great, just what I needed—a stalker with a florist budget. [Tsk] [Fast] Can't wait to explain this to my roommate. [Disappointed] I was hoping they'd at least, you know, sign the card or something. [Sigh] Now I'm gonna be paranoid about literally everyone I talk to. [Angry] This better not be some kind of—ugh, if this is Jake trying to apologize again, I swear! [Groan] [Happy] [Fast] Wait wait wait, these are orchids, like, expensive orchids—whoever this is really went all out, didn't they? [Chuckle] [Slow] You know what's weird? [Whisper] I had a dream about getting flowers last week, and they looked exactly like these. [Sad] I wish I could just, um, enjoy this without overthinking everything. [Sigh] But my brain's already making a list of suspects. [Shout] Are you kidding me right now? [Happy] These are gorgeous! [Laugh] I don't even care who sent them! [Sarcastic] Oh sure, leave me guessing, that's not gonna drive me completely insane or anything. [Fast] [Tsk] Real smooth, secret admirer. [Disappointed] Honestly? [Slow] I thought if someone ever sent me flowers, it'd be more... I dunno, romantic? Not this creepy anonymous thing. [Happy] Should I, like—should I put these on Instagram? [Chuckle] Or is that basically asking the universe to reveal my secret admirer? [Angry] [Fast] I specifically told everyone at my birthday that I'm allergic to—oh wait, these are silk. [Laugh] Okay, that's actually thoughtful. [Whisper] What if it's, um, what if it's that person from the coffee shop? [Slow] The one who always remembers my order? [Sad] [Slow] My ex used to send me flowers like this, but he'd always—no, it couldn't be him. [Sigh] Could it? [Sarcastic] Let me guess, next comes the anonymous love letters? [Fast] Maybe some chocolates? [Groan] This is like a bad rom-com. [Happy] I'm literally shaking right now—look at my hands! [Laugh] [Fast] This is the most exciting thing that's happened to me all year! [Disappointed] They're beautiful, but I kinda—I mean, wouldn't it be better to just, you know, talk to me like a normal person? [Tsk] [Shout] Mom, if this is you trying to—actually, that's something you'd totally do! [Angry] [Groan] Please tell me this isn't you! [Whisper] [Slow] Okay so, hypothetically, if I wanted to find out who sent these... where would I even start?

SCENARIO: Casually mentioning a notification they dismissed, then checking what it was, then finding it was a fraud alert they ignored, ending in financial security panic
[casual]
Oh yeah, so I'm just sitting there eating lunch, and my phone keeps buzzing with notifications. You know how it is, probably just Instagram or whatever, so I'm just swiping them away without really looking.
[conversational]
I mean, who has time to check every single notification, right? It's usually just junk anyway. So I'm just— [dismissive noise] swipe, swipe, swipe, trying to eat my sandwich in peace.
[slight curiosity]
But now I'm kind of curious what I missed, you know? Let me just... [pause] okay, let's see what was so important that my phone had to have a seizure about it.
[mild concern]
Huh. There's one here from my bank. "Important security alert" or something. I probably just— wait, when did I get this? This was like two hours ago.
[growing worry]
"We've detected unusual activity on your account." What? [sharp intake] What unusual activity? I haven't done anything unusual! Oh god, what if someone—
[panic building]
It says here someone tried to make a $3,000 purchase in... in Nevada?! I've never been to Nevada! [voice rising] And it says I have 24 hours to respond and I— and I ignored it! For two hours!
[full panic]
Oh my god, oh my god, what if they got into my account? What if they cleaned me out while I was sitting here eating a stupid sandwich?! [frantic] I need to call them right now, I need to— my savings, my— [hyperventilating] why didn't I just look at my phone?!

SCENARIO: Excited about cooking, then messing up a step, then it turning out delicious anyway
[excited] [bouncy]
Oh my God, okay, so I was so pumped today because I finally decided to make that butternut squash risotto recipe I've been bookmarking for like months. You know the one from that food blog I'm always sending you? [chuckle] I went to three different stores to find the right kind of rice, I got the good parmesan, like the whole thing.
[enthusiastic]
And I'm like chopping everything up, I've got my mise en place all perfect like I'm on a cooking show or whatever, and I'm feeling so fancy. The butternut squash is roasting, smells incredible, I'm stirring the rice, adding the stock bit by bit like you're supposed to— I was in the zone, you know?
[frustrated] [slightly panicked]
But then I completely spaced and dumped like half the stock in at once instead of ladling it slowly. [groan] I was like, oh no, I just ruined it, it's gonna be like soup instead of creamy risotto. I was honestly ready to just order pizza and call it a day.
[confused] [slower]
But wait, actually— I'm eating it right now and it's like... it's actually really good? Like weirdly good. The rice absorbed it all somehow and it's got this perfect texture that's like—
[delighted] [warm]
Oh my God, it's better than I thought it would be even if I did it right! [laugh] Sometimes screwing up is the best thing that can happen, I guess.
