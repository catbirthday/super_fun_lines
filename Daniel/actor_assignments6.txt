Script: 69158c1c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: I won that lip sync thing last night.
380 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you WON? Oh my god, I thought you were just gonna like, participate and leave! What song did you even do?
Character 1: "Toxic." Britney Spears.
381 Character 2: Stop it. Stop— are you serious? YOU did Britney? Mr. "I Don't Dance"? I literally cannot picture this, like, at all.
Character 1: I had a wig.
382 Character 2: A WIG? Okay okay okay, now I'm—honestly I'm kinda mad you didn't tell me about this beforehand because I would've been there filming every second. Did you like, actually perform perform?
Character 1: Yeah. The whole thing. Even did the chair part.
383 Character 2: The chair—oh my GOD the chair choreography? That's so— I'm literally dying right now. Who were you even up against?
Character 1: Some guy doing "Eye of the Tiger." He punched the air a lot.
384 Character 2: Of course, of course it was some dude doing like, the most basic— I mean, no offense to him but that's such a safe choice, y'know? And you just went full Britney on him?
Character 1: Pretty much.
385 Character 2: This is—okay this is literally the best thing I've heard all week. What did you win? Please tell me there's like, a trophy or something.
Character 1: Fifty dollar bar tab and a plastic crown.
386 Character 2: A crown! Yes! Are you gonna—wait, did you keep it? Please say you kept the crown because that's basically, that's like your origin story now.
Character 1: It's in my car.
387 Character 2: Good, good good good. So um, real question though—how did it feel? Like, being up there doing... that?
Character 1: Kind of incredible, actually.
388 Character 2: See? SEE? I knew—I mean, I always knew you had this in you somewhere, you just needed the right, like, the right moment to let it out, y'know?
Character 1: My coworkers were there. Monday's going to be interesting.
389 Character 2: Oh no no no, Monday's gonna be AMAZING. You're literally gonna be a legend. The quiet one who destroyed everyone with Britney? That's—that's iconic, honestly.
Script: bad7410f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: This is the fourth time.
390 Character 2: I know, I know how it looks, okay? But I literally got rear-ended on the way here. Like, I have the guy's insurance info if you wanna—I'm not making this up.
Character 1: There's always something.
391 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not fair. You're acting like I plan for my car to break down or my boss to call me in last minute. This stuff just happens to me, I dunno why.
Character 1: Every single time we make plans.
392 Character 2: Okay okay, not every time. Last month we hung out like three times without any issues. You're just focusing on the bad ones because you're mad right now.
Character 1: Three times. Out of how many?
393 Character 2: I mean—look, I get that you're frustrated, I really do. But what am I supposed to do when my landlord literally floods my apartment the morning we're supposed to meet? Just swim through it?
Character 1: You could've called earlier.
394 Character 2: I did call! As soon as I—okay, maybe it was like an hour late, but I was kinda dealing with water everywhere and trying to save my laptop from drowning. Sorry I wasn't thinking about perfect communication timing.
Character 1: It's not about perfect. It's about respect.
395 Character 2: Respect? Seriously? I respect you, that's why I'm here now trying to explain. You're acting like I'm some—like I don't care about our friendship or something, which is honestly kinda hurtful.
Character 1: Actions speak louder.
396 Character 2: Oh, so all the times I've been there for you just don't count anymore? When your ex was being a nightmare, who stayed up til 4am with you? But sure, I'm just—I'm the worst friend ever because the universe hates me.
Character 1: Don't be dramatic.
397 Character 2: I'm not being— okay, fine. Maybe I am a little. But you gotta understand, this is frustrating for me too. You think I like having to cancel? You think I enjoy being the flaky friend?
Character 1: Then do something about it.
398 Character 2: Do what exactly? Control traffic? Predict when my mom's gonna end up in the ER? I'm trying here, I really am, but some things are literally—they're out of my control, y'know?
Character 1: Right. Out of your control. Everything always is.
399 Character 2: That's—wow. Okay. If that's really what you think of me, then I dunno what else to say. I came here to apologize and explain, but clearly you've already decided I'm just full of excuses, so... yeah.
Script: 24607571_script | Role: Character 2 (B)
Character 1: We need to talk.
400 Character 2: Oh! Um, yeah—yeah of course. Is everything okay? You seem kinda upset and I'm—wait, did I do something?
Character 1: Do you remember what happened at lunch yesterday?
401 Character 2: Lunch? I mean, we talked about a bunch of stuff, right? Your mom's surgery and then—oh! And I told you about my dentist appointment thing. Was there something specific or...?
Character 1: My mom's surgery. Right. We talked about that for maybe thirty seconds.
402 Character 2: Wait wait wait, that's not—I listened! I did! I remember you saying she was nervous and then I... oh god, I started talking about my root canal, didn't I?
Character 1: Like you always do.
403 Character 2: No no no, that's—okay, I can see how it looked but I was trying to relate, y'know? Like, I wanted you to know I understood the medical anxiety thing and—shit, I'm doing it again, aren't I?
Character 1: Every single time I try to talk to you about something important.
404 Character 2: I don't—that's not— okay. Okay, you're right. I just realized I literally cannot think of the last time we had a conversation that didn't somehow become about me and that's... that's really messed up.
Character 1: I told you my dad lost his job. You talked about your freelance stress for twenty minutes.
405 Character 2: Oh my god. I—I did do that. I'm so sorry, I didn't even—I thought I was being supportive? But I wasn't listening at all, was I? Just waiting for my turn to talk.
Character 1: I've been trying to tell you about Mom's diagnosis for three weeks.
406 Character 2: Diagnosis? What diagnosis? Oh god, is she—is it serious? I'm such a terrible friend, you needed me and I just kept rambling about my stupid problems.
Character 1: It's treatable. But scary. And I needed my best friend.
407 Character 2: I'm—fuck, I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, deeply sorry. You needed support and I just... made it all about me. Again. I don't even know why I do it, it's like—no, see, there I go again. This isn't about me.
Character 1: I just need you to actually hear me sometimes.
408 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right and I—I wanna do better. I will do better. Can you... would you wanna tell me about it now? About your mom? I promise I'll actually listen this time. No interruptions.
Character 1: Yeah. Okay. But if you start talking about yourself again, I'm leaving.
409 Character 2: I won't. I swear I won't. And if I slip up—which, knowing me, I might—just call me out, okay? I really don't wanna lose you over this. You mean too much to me.

410 SCENARIO: [scenario description]
Source: c26d56a5
SCENARIO: a new mother holds baby Emma for the first time
[whispered, awestruck]
Oh my god. Oh my— Emma? Emma, hi. Hi there. [soft laugh] I can't— I can't believe you're, um, you're actually here. Like, you're real. You're a real little person and you're— you're mine? That's, uh, that's still kind of hard to wrap my head around.
[gentle, rambling]
Okay so, um, how do I— how do I hold you properly? They showed me in the class but that was with, like, a fake baby and you're so much more— you're so much smaller than I thought you'd be. Your hands are tiny. Like, impossibly tiny.
[slightly anxious]
Wait, am I— am I supporting your head right? I feel like maybe I should— should I adjust my arm? The nurse said something about the neck but I can't remember if— [exhale] okay, you seem comfortable. You're not crying so that's, um, that's probably good.
[softer, wondering]
You smell like— what do you smell like? It's not baby powder or anything, it's just... you. Is that weird? That you already smell like you? I didn't know babies came with their own smell.
[tender, trailing off]
I'm your mom. That's so... I mean, I know that, obviously, but saying it out loud is just— wow. We're gonna figure this out together, aren't we, Emma? Both of us just... learning as we go.
--- CONVERSATION ---
Script: cc40452a | Role: Character A
411 Character A: [cheerfully] Beautiful evening, isn't it? [getting louder] I just love this time of year—the leaves, the crisp air! [Deep breath] Been driving for twelve hours straight but I'm still energized, you know what I mean?
Character B: [exhausted mumble] Mmm-hmm, yeah. [yawning] That's... that's great. [slower] Just got off a red-eye from Seattle, then straight to meetings all day. My brain feels like pudding right now, honestly.
412 Character A: [enthusiastically] Seattle! [pitched higher] Oh man, I've always wanted to visit the Space Needle! [rapid-fire] Is it true they have coffee shops on every corner? My cousin says the rain is actually quite peaceful there.
Character B: [flatly] Yeah, lots of coffee. [Sigh] And rain. [more quietly] Look, I'm sorry, I'm just really tired and need to close my eyes for a bit if that's okay with you.
413 Character A: [undeterred] No problem at all! [nervous chuckle] Though, funny story—last passenger who fell asleep ended up at the airport instead of downtown! [louder] Don't worry though, I've got your address right here on the app!
Character B: [alarmed] Wait, what? [groggily] Please just... follow the GPS. [desperate whisper] I really can't handle any detours tonight. My bed is calling my name like a siren song, you know?
414 Character A: [excitedly] Speaking of songs, you hear this one? [humming loudly] It's been stuck in my head all week! [Laugh] My wife says I should audition for one of those singing shows—what do you think?
Character B: [strained politeness] You sound... very enthusiastic. [clearing throat] That's nice your wife supports you. [more firmly] Hey, could we maybe turn the music down just a tiny bit? Headache starting to kick in.
415 Character A: [apologetically] Oh sure, sure! [softer] Traffic's getting thick here anyway. [speeding up] You know, I read somewhere that traffic patterns actually follow mathematical equations—chaos theory stuff! [excited whisper] Fascinating how everything connects, right?
Character B: [monotone] Chaos theory. [Exhale] That actually perfectly describes my entire day today. [sarcastically] Maybe the universe is trying to tell me something through this eternal car ride and your commentary.
416 Character A: [missing the sarcasm] Exactly! [gleefully] The universe speaks in mysterious ways! [getting philosophical] Like how we met tonight—what are the odds? Out of all the drivers and passengers in this massive city!
Character B: [defeated] Astronomical odds, truly. [muttering] At this point I'd calculate the odds of me surviving without screaming. [perking up slightly] Oh thank God, is that my street coming up on the right there?
417 Character A: [disappointedly] Already? [brightening] Time flies when you're having good conversation! [rushed words] Hey, before you go—I also do airport runs, special events, wine tours if you ever need a reliable driver!
Character B: [hurriedly] That's great, really great. [relieved sigh] I'll definitely keep that in mind for... future needs. [more quietly] Would you mind pulling up right by that blue door? My legs are basically jelly.
418 Character A: [enthusiastically] Blue door, got it! [helpfully] Need help with bags? [Chuckle] I've got strong arms from my CrossFit classes—did I mention I do CrossFit? Just started last month but I'm totally hooked!
Character B: [quickly] No, no, I'm good! [exhausted laugh] Just the one bag. [firmly] Thank you for the ride, really appreciate you getting me home safe despite my zombie-like state tonight.
419 Character A: [warmly] My pleasure! [calling out] Don't forget to rate five stars! [hopeful tone] And remember—if you need a ride tomorrow, request me specifically! Name's Gary, Gary with a 'G' like 'Great rides guaranteed!'
Character B: [walking away] Five stars, absolutely. [under breath] Gary with a 'G.' [louder] Have a good night, and maybe try some decaf for the rest of your shift, yeah?
420 Character A: [laughing] Decaf? [incredulous] Never touch the stuff! [shouting cheerfully] Life's too short for fake coffee! Oh hey, you forgot your—oh wait, that's my phone. Safe travels! See you next time!
Character B: [from distance] There won't be a—[Sigh] You know what, sure. [resigned whisper] See you next time, Gary. [to self] Note to self: always check the 'quiet ride' preference option in the app.
Script: b568b96a | Role: Character A
421 Character A: [panicked whisper] Did you hear that? [Sharp gasp] Something's moving between those trees, I swear I saw eyes. [voice breaking] We shouldn't have come this deep into the woods, Marcus, this was such a stupid idea.
Character B: [forced calm] Keep your flashlight steady. [trembling] Whatever it is, it's been following us for the last ten minutes. [quieter] Don't make any sudden movements—predators react to fear and we're already reeking of it.
422 Character A: [high-pitched terror] It's getting closer! [Choking sob] Oh God, oh God, I can smell it—like rotting meat and sulfur. [frantically] We need to run NOW, forget staying calm, we need to get out of here!
Character B: [harsh whisper] Running triggers the chase instinct! [more urgently] But you're right about the smell. [Shuddering breath] That's not any animal I've ever hunted. This thing, whatever it is, it's not from around here.
423 Character A: [barely audible] My grandfather told stories. [voice cracking] About things that hunt the hunters, creatures that wait for decades between meals. [Whimpering] I thought they were just campfire tales to scare kids away from dangerous places.
Character B: [grim realization] The old Sherman disappearances. [slower] Three hunters vanished right here in '87, then again in 2003. [Nervous laugh] Everyone said it was bears, but bears don't leave claw marks that deep in tree bark.
424 Character A: [screaming] THERE! RIGHT THERE! [gasping frantically] Its face—I saw its face in the moonlight! [sobbing openly] Those aren't human eyes, Marcus, nothing natural has eyes that glow like burning coals in the darkness!
Character B: [shouting] Back to back, NOW! [determined growl] Load your rifle with the silver rounds—I don't care if you think it's superstition. [through gritted teeth] My grandmother blessed these bullets, and right now I'll take any help.
425 Character A: [desperate pleading] The radio's dead, phones have no signal. [voice rising hysterically] We're completely alone out here! [Ragged breathing] Even if we scream until our throats bleed, nobody will hear us, nobody will come help us.
Character B: [deadly quiet] It's circling us. [measured words] Testing our defenses, looking for weakness like any apex predator would. [louder] When I say shoot, you empty your clip into whatever moves, understood? Don't hesitate, don't think.
426 Character A: [stuttering wildly] M-my hands won't stop sh-shaking! [Terrified shriek] Something just touched my shoulder! [crying] Was that you? Please tell me that was you touching my shoulder, please, please tell me that was you!
Character B: [ice cold fear] That wasn't me. [almost inaudible] I'm five feet away from you. [Shaky exhale] Don't turn around, just slowly step forward toward my voice and whatever you do, don't look behind you.
427 Character A: [whispering prayers] Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. [more frantically] It's breathing on my neck, I can feel its breath. [Muffled scream] Hot and wet and it smells like death itself.
Character B: [commanding shout] DROP AND ROLL! [fierce] NOW! [Grunting] I've got a clear shot—just get down and cover your ears because this is going to be loud and messy and probably won't stop it!
428 Character A: [exhausted panting] Did you hit it? [disbelieving] There's black blood everywhere but it's still moving! [stronger] The stories said fire—we need fire! My grandfather always said they're afraid of flames, ancient primal fear!
Character B: [urgently] The emergency flares! [rummaging sounds] In my pack, three of them. [determined tone] If this thing's been here since the frontier days, maybe the old ways are the only ways that work against it.
429 Character A: [sudden realization] Wait, listen. [confused whisper] It stopped. Everything's gone quiet—no birds, no insects, even the wind died. [growing dread] That's not good, is it? Silence like this means something worse is coming.
Character B: [strained whisper] It's above us. [barely breathing] In the trees, I can see its shadow against the stars. [Gulp] It's huge, bigger than I thought. Don't make eye contact when it drops, just run.
430 Character A: [building courage] On three we split up. [shaking but determined] It can't chase both of us, and whoever it doesn't follow makes it back to warn the others. [Heavy breath] One... two... this is our only chance.
Character B: [resigned acceptance] If I don't make it, tell Sarah I loved her. [final whisper] It's moving. [Roaring shout] THREE! RUN! GO GO GO! Don't look back, just run and don't stop until you hit the road!

Script: b21222f3 | Role: Customer Support
431 Customer Support: Returns desk, I'm Marcus. Do you have your receipt or order number?
Customer: Um, yeah, I got—wait, no that's not... Here, it's this one with all the numbers on it, R-K-3-3-9-2-A or maybe 8? The thing is broke.
432 Customer Support: I need the exact order number to look this up. Is it RK3392A or RK3398A?
Customer: The eight one, yeah. So like, I bought this—what do you call it—the exercise thing with the bands? And it's not, you know, it doesn't do what it's supposed to.
433 Customer Support: I see order RK3398A for resistance bands, purchased November 15th. What specific defect are you reporting?
Customer: It's not defective exactly, it's just—I thought it was gonna be different? Like bigger or, um, more heavy duty kind of thing for working out and stuff.
434 Customer Support: Our return policy requires items to be defective or unopened for a full refund. Since you've opened it and it's not defective, I can only offer store credit under policy code P-7-7-4.
Customer: But that's not—I mean, the picture showed something else! Can't you just, you know, take it back? I got the box still, mostly.
435 Customer Support: The product matches SKU number B-T-4-4-5-9-X listed on your receipt. Without a defect, I need manager approval for exceptions, which requires filling out form F-2-2-1.
Customer: Forms? No, no, I don't want—look, can't we just do this simple? I give you the thing, you give me money, like normal stores do.
436 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, but policy is policy. Let me call my supervisor, extension 4-5-6, to see if we can work something out.
Customer: Finally, someone who—wait, how long is that gonna take? I got places to be, and this whole thing is already taking forever with all these numbers and rules.
437 Customer Support: She'll be here in two minutes. Meanwhile, can you confirm the credit card ending in 7-8-9-2 for the potential refund?
Customer: Seven eight... yeah that's the one. But hold on, potential? What's potential about it? Either you're giving me my money or you're not, right?
438 Customer Support: The supervisor needs to review case number C-R-9-9-2-3-4 first. She has discretion to override policy P-7-7-4 for customer satisfaction purposes.
Customer: Case number now? How many numbers you people need? I just want my forty-seven dollars and ninety-nine cents back, or forty-eight, whatever it was.
439 Customer Support: Here's my supervisor now. She'll review everything under transaction ID T-M-6-6-5-4-3 and make a determination.
Customer: Transaction I—you know what, fine, whatever she needs to look at. Just please, can someone make this stop being so complicated?
440 Customer Support: Ma'am, this customer wants to return order RK3398A outside policy guidelines. Case number C-R-9-9-2-3-4 has been created for your review.
Customer: See, that's all I wanted from the start—someone to actually help instead of throwing all these codes and policies at me like I work here or something.
--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---
441 [Disappointed] So, um, I really gotta—I mean, my parking meter's definitely expired by now. [Fast] I should probably go check on that before I get a ticket. [Whisper] Hey, uh, I think my phone's been vibrating for like ten minutes straight? [Nervous laugh] [Sigh] Someone's probably wondering where I am. [Sarcastic] Wow, this is—this is fascinating, truly, but my cat's gonna starve if I don't leave right now. [Tsk] [Happy] Oh! [Fast] You know what, I just remembered I've got that thing—the thing I told you about last week? [Chuckle] Yeah, I should really run! [Slow] Listen, I'm gonna have to, uh... [Sigh] [Disappointed] I'm gonna have to stop you right there because I genuinely can't be late again. [Angry] Okay, I've been trying to—look, I've said "goodbye" three times already! [Groan] I really need to go! [Sad] I wish I could stay and hear the rest, honestly, but I'm just—I'm exhausted. [Slow] Maybe we can continue this another time? [Fast] [Happy] Right, so basically my Uber's here and the driver's texting me like crazy, so I'm just gonna—yeah, bye! [Whisper] Can I just—sorry, but I really have to use the bathroom. [Fast] Like, urgently. [Nervous laugh] [Shout] MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE! [Laugh] No, I'm kidding, but seriously though, I do need to leave. [Sarcastic] [Slow] Mhmm, yeah, absolutely riveting stuff here, but, uh, my dentist appointment was actually twenty minutes ago, so... [Disappointed] You're not really picking up on my hints, are you? [Tsk] [Fast] I've been edging toward the door for literally five minutes now. [Sad] I don't wanna be rude or anything, but I'm kinda—I mean, I'm getting a migraine? [Sigh] I just need to go lie down. [Angry] [Fast] No, no, no, we're not doing the whole story again—I heard it the first time! [Groan] I'm leaving! [Happy] Oh my god, wait—is that the time? [Laugh] [Fast] I totally forgot I'm supposed to pick up my kid from school! [Slow] [Whisper] So, um, this is awkward, but my ex just walked in and I really can't—yeah. [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Let me just, uh, let me just stop you right there—fascinating as your cousin's wedding drama is... [Sigh] [Disappointed] I've got actual work to do. [Shout] [Happy] ANYWAY! Great talk! Gotta bounce! [Laugh] See ya! [Slow] I'm gonna be honest with you here—I stopped listening about ten minutes ago? [Chuckle] [Sad] My brain's just completely fried today. [Fast] [Angry] Y'know what, I'm just gonna—I'm walking away now, like literally walking away, because apparently saying "bye" doesn't work! [Groan]

SCENARIO: Upset about a disappointing gift, then finds a heartfelt note inside they missed
[frustrated]
Ugh, so you know how I was all excited about my birthday yesterday? Well, my mom got me this— this stupid generic candle set from like the grocery store. Like, seriously? [scoff] I know she probably spent like twelve bucks on it, and it's just... it's so impersonal, you know?
[disappointed]
I mean, I don't need anything expensive, but it's like she doesn't even know me at all. It was just sitting there in this plastic wrap with like a "Happy Birthday" sticker slapped on top. I was trying not to look upset but I was just like... really?
[hurt]
I kept thinking about how Sarah's mom got her that beautiful necklace last month, and here I am with "Vanilla Dreams" and "Ocean Breeze" or whatever. I just— I felt so... forgotten, you know? Like she just grabbed whatever was closest to the checkout line.
[emotional]
So I was about to just shove the whole thing in my closet and— wait, there's something... there's like paper stuck under here. Hold on, let me just—
[voice catching]
Oh my god. Oh my god, there's a note. She... she wrote about how vanilla was my favorite when I was little, and how I used to say the ocean smelled like home after our beach trips.
[tearful] [warm]
She remembers everything. I'm such an idiot. [half laugh] I'm literally crying over candles right now.
