Character 1: So. My tutorial got featured.

862 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? Featured where? Oh my god, are you—are you serious right now? Like, featured featured?

Character 1: On the main page. Twenty thousand views already.

863 Character 2: Twenty thou— [Gasp] okay, okay I'm literally shaking for you right now. That's like—that's huge! Which one was it? The glowy one or the, um, the dramatic eye thing?

Character 1: The one I almost deleted. The "no-makeup makeup" one.

864 Character 2: Stop it. The one you said was boring? The one you literally—oh my god, I told you! Didn't I tell you that one was, like, perfection?

Character 1: You did. Multiple times.

865 Character 2: I mean, yeah because it was—it was so good! And now look, twenty thousand people agree with me. Are the comments nice? Please tell me they're being nice.

Character 1: Mostly. Some people think I used too much concealer.

866 Character 2: Oh, come on. There's always gonna be those people who just—ugh, whatever. [Groan] They probably use their fingers for everything. Have brands reached out yet?

Character 1: Three DMs. I haven't opened them.

867 Character 2: You haven't—babe, what? Why not? That could be like, that could be actual money! Or free stuff! Or—or both!

Character 1: It's weird. This was just for fun.

868 Character 2: Okay but like—no no no, listen. Fun doesn't mean you can't also, y'know, benefit from it? You're talented. That's—that's literally why it got featured in the first place.

Character 1: Maybe. I don't know. It feels different now.

869 Character 2: Different how? Like pressure different or like... scary different? Because honestly, both are kinda normal, right?

Character 1: Both. My mom already texted asking if I'm becoming an "influencer."

870 Character 2: Oh god, parents and—and air quotes around influencer. [Laugh] Classic. But seriously though, you don't have to be anything. You can just... keep doing what you're doing, y'know?

Character 1: Yeah. Maybe I'll check those DMs tomorrow.

871 Character 2: That's my girl! And hey—if they're weird or pushy or whatever, we can just, like, roast them together over wine. But I'm telling you, this is—this is really cool. You should be proud.

Script: 61811a9d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: My boss knows about my anxiety medication now.

872 Character 2: Oh god. Oh no no no, I didn't—wait, let me explain what happened. We were just talking about weekend plans and somehow health stuff came up and I—I mentioned it without thinking, I'm so sorry.

Character 1: You had no right.

873 Character 2: I know, I know! You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm literally the worst friend. It just kinda slipped out when she was talking about her own stuff and I thought—no, I wasn't thinking, that's the problem.

Character 1: That was private medical information.

874 Character 2: You're right, you're completely right. I just—we were having coffee and she was being so open about her own anxiety and I got comfortable and... [groan] that's not an excuse. I shouldn't have said anything, period.

Character 1: So you just decided to share mine too?

875 Character 2: No! I mean—not decided, it wasn't like a conscious choice or anything. But that doesn't matter, right? The damage is done and I—I honestly don't know what's wrong with me sometimes. Like my mouth just goes before my brain catches up.

Character 1: This could affect my promotion.

876 Character 2: Wait, what? No, she wouldn't—she was actually really understanding about it. [nervous laugh] She said tons of people deal with the same thing and it doesn't change how she sees you at all, I promise.

Character 1: That's not the point.

877 Character 2: Right. Yeah, no, you're—you're totally right. The point is I betrayed your trust and it wasn't my place to say anything regardless of how she reacted. I just... I wanna fix this so badly but I don't know how.

Character 1: You can't just fix everything by talking.

878 Character 2: I know that. God, do I know that. But I—what else can I do, y'know? I already feel terrible and I've been beating myself up about it since yesterday. Should I talk to her? Try to explain that it was my fault for oversharing?

Character 1: Don't make this worse.

879 Character 2: Okay. Okay, I won't. I just—I really need you to know that I get why you're mad. Like, if you'd told my boss something personal about me, I'd be furious too. [sigh] I completely violated your privacy.

Character 1: At least you understand that much.

880 Character 2: I do, I really do. And I'm gonna—I mean, from now on, anything you tell me stays with me. No exceptions. I know that's what I should've been doing all along but... I'm gonna be better. I have to be better.

Character 1: I need some time to think about this.

881 Character 2: Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. I'm just—I'm really, truly sorry. And um, whenever you're ready to talk, if you wanna talk, I'll be here. However you need me to be.

Script: 51fb72ee_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I got it.

882 Character 2: Wait, you—you got what? Oh my god, wait wait wait, are you talking about the apartment? The one with the, um, the exposed brick and everything?

Character 1: Yeah. They called an hour ago.

883 Character 2: Shut UP! Are you—oh my god, I'm literally gonna cry right now [Laugh] This is huge! After all that stress with the other places falling through, you actually—you got it!

Character 1: I know. Still processing.

884 Character 2: Okay okay, so like, when do you move? Have you told your landlord yet? God, I bet he's gonna be so pissed when you give notice.

Character 1: End of the month. Haven't told him.

885 Character 2: End of the—that's like two weeks! Oh man, we gotta start packing, like, immediately. I can help! Actually wait, do you even have boxes? Because I've got a bunch from when I—

Character 1: I haven't signed yet.

886 Character 2: You haven't—wait, what? Why not? Is there something wrong with the lease or... [Sigh] please don't tell me you're getting cold feet about this.

Character 1: What if it's a mistake? It's a lot more rent.

887 Character 2: Okay, no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. Remember how miserable you've been in that shoebox? With the neighbors and the, um, the weird smell in the hallway?

Character 1: The smell's gotten worse, actually.

888 Character 2: See? That's—exactly! And yeah, it's more money, but like, you got that raise, right? You can totally swing this. Plus you'll actually wanna, y'know, invite people over now.

Character 1: True. My place is embarrassing.

889 Character 2: It's not embarrass—okay it's a little embarrassing [Chuckle] but that's not your fault! That kitchen is literally from like 1982 or something.

Character 1: Try 1978. Found the original paperwork.

890 Character 2: Oh my god, that's—that's even worse than I thought. Babe, you deserve a place with, I dunno, a dishwasher? Counter space? Windows that actually open?

Character 1: The windows do open. Just not all the way.

891 Character 2: Right, like three inches. Super helpful in summer. Look, I'm just—I'm really really happy for you, okay? This is gonna be so good for you, I can just feel it.

Script: ee381b24_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: My mom was in the hospital.

892 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, I—I didn't know. Nobody told me, I swear I would've been there if I'd known. Is she okay? Is she—wait, when was this?

Character 1: Tuesday. I called you six times.

893 Character 2: Tuesday? That's—oh no. No no no, that was the day my phone died at work and I didn't—I didn't charge it until like midnight because I just crashed when I got home. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: Right.

894 Character 2: I mean it though, I literally had no idea. If I'd gotten your calls I would've dropped everything, you know that right? Like, you gotta know I would never just ignore you when something like that—when you needed me.

Character 1: But you weren't there.

895 Character 2: I know. I know and I—honestly, I don't even know what to say except I'm sorry. That's not enough, I get that, but I am so, so sorry. How is she now? Your mom?

Character 1: She's stable. No thanks to you.

896 Character 2: Okay, I deserve that. I do. But can we just—[sigh] I'm trying here, alright? I messed up, I should've had my phone on, I should've been reachable. I just... I wanna make this right somehow.

Character 1: You can't. I sat there alone for eight hours.

897 Character 2: Eight hours? Jesus. That must've been—I can't even imagine how scary that was. And lonely. God, I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? Like actually the worst.

Character 1: I really needed someone.

898 Character 2: I know you did. And I—the thing is, I've been there for you before, right? Remember when your dad had his surgery? Or when you got laid off? I was—I mean, I'm not trying to make excuses but—

Character 1: This was different.

899 Character 2: No, you're right. You're totally right, it was different and I—I failed you. Plain and simple. I failed you when it mattered most and that's gonna eat at me for a really long time. Probably forever, honestly.

Character 1: She asked where you were.

900 Character 2: She did? Your mom asked about me? [quieter] Now I feel even worse. Um, would it—would it be okay if I visited her? Brought flowers or something? I dunno, whatever she likes. Those magazines she reads?

Character 1: Maybe. I need time to think about it.

901 Character 2: Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—I really am sorry. And I'm gonna keep my phone charged from now on, like religiously. Whatever you decide, just... know that I'm here now, okay? If that still means anything.

Script: fe0b5539_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three extra people. Really?

902 Character 2: I know, I know—okay, that looks bad. But they were literally at my place when you texted and they heard me talking about coming over and I couldn't just—I mean, what was I supposed to say? "Sorry guys, you can't come"?

Character 1: Yes. That's exactly what you say.

903 Character 2: Right, yeah, I—I should've done that. You're right. I just... they were so excited and I'm really bad at saying no to people, you know? Like, really bad. [nervous laugh] Which is not an excuse, I'm just—I'm trying to explain what happened.

Character 1: I had food for two people.

904 Character 2: Oh god, the food—I didn't even think about that. I'm so sorry. We can—we can order something? I'll pay for everything, obviously. Pizza or Chinese or whatever you want. I've got my phone right here, just tell me what sounds good.

Character 1: That's not the point.

905 Character 2: No no no, you're right, it's not about the food. It's about—I violated your space, basically. Your home. Without asking. [Sigh] And that's... that's really messed up of me, honestly.

Character 1: I wanted a quiet night.

906 Character 2: I know you did. And instead you got—god, Tyler was so loud, wasn't he? I kept trying to get him to dial it down but he just... doesn't have an indoor voice, apparently. I should've—I should've just left when I saw how uncomfortable you were.

Character 1: You should've asked first.

907 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That's like—that's basic courtesy, right? Just basic human decency to ask before bringing a whole crew to someone's house. I don't—I don't know why I thought it would be fine. Actually, no, I didn't think. That's the problem. [quieter] I just didn't think at all.

Character 1: You never do.

908 Character 2: That's—okay, that's fair. I mean, it hurts, but it's fair. I do this thing where I just... assume everything will work out? And I don't consider how it affects other people. My therapist literally talked to me about this last week. I'm working on it, I swear.

Character 1: This isn't the first time.

909 Character 2: No, it's not. Remember your birthday dinner? When I brought my cousin? And that time at the movies... [Groan] Oh my god, I really do have a pattern, don't I? I'm—I'm that friend. The one who doesn't respect boundaries.

Character 1: I just wanted you to respect mine. Once.

910 Character 2: You're right to be mad. Like, genuinely, I would be furious if someone kept doing this to me. I don't—I don't wanna be that person anymore, okay? The one who makes you feel like your needs don't matter. Because they do. They really, really do matter to me.

Character 1: I need you to actually change this time. Not just apologize.

911 Character 2: I will. I mean—I want to. No, I will. Next time, I'll ask. Every time, actually. Even if it seems obvious that it's okay, I'll check with you first. And if I slip up, you can—you can call me out immediately. I wanna do better. For real this time.

912 SCENARIO: trying to decide which streaming service has the show they want

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I want to watch that show— what was it called? The, um, the one with the— [sigh] right, okay, focus. I know it's on one of these apps, I just need to, uh, I just need to figure out which one.

[slightly impatient]

Let me just— let me just check Netflix first because that's, like, that's usually where everything is, right? Except when it's not. Which is, um, which is most of the time now, actually. [tsk] Scrolling, scrolling... nope. Not seeing it.

[matter-of-fact]

Okay so maybe Hulu? I feel like I saw it on Hulu before, but that was like— that was like six months ago, so who knows if it's still— [groan] why do they keep moving things around? That's so annoying.

[brightening slightly]

Wait, wait wait. What about— what about HBO Max? Or is it just Max now? I can never remember what they're calling it. [hmm] Let me try that one. Although I'm pretty sure my subscription expired and I keep forgetting to—

[resigned]

You know what, I'm just gonna Google it. "Where to watch"— yeah, this is, uh, this is way easier than playing streaming service roulette for twenty minutes.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 6abc6d76 | Role: Character 1 (A)

913 Character 1: [panicked] The timer—it's stuck at thirty seconds! [voice rising] It hasn't moved for the past minute, which means— [Sharp intake of breath] Oh god, the real bomb must be somewhere else entirely in this building.

Character 2: [hushed terror] You're joking. [more urgently] Check the wiring again, maybe it's just frozen? [Nervous laugh] Because if you're right, we've been standing here like idiots while the actual device is counting down somewhere.

914 Character 1: [frantic whisper] Listen carefully—no ticking. [louder] Real bombs tick, this one's completely silent! [Gasping] We need to evacuate everyone now, but which floor? The basement? The roof? Where would you hide it?

Character 2: [eerily calm] Stop. Think. [quickening pace] If I wanted maximum casualties, I'd put it in the ventilation system. [Sharp exhale] The air ducts connect every floor—one explosion would distribute the blast through the entire structure.

915 Character 1: [defeated tone] Twenty-three minutes we've wasted on this fake. [angrier] Twenty-three minutes! [Bitter laugh] Their psychological warfare worked perfectly—we fell for the obvious decoy while the real threat lurks somewhere we haven't even checked yet.

Character 2: [commanding] Pull yourself together. [softer] Radio Martinez, tell her to check all maintenance shafts immediately. [Grunt] And for the love of— someone needs to sound the fire alarm without causing a stampede, understand?

916 Character 1: [shaking voice] My phone's dead. [more steadily] The EMP from earlier must have— wait, yours too? [Horrified whisper] They planned this perfectly, cutting our communications before we even realized we'd been played.

Character 2: [through gritted teeth] The emergency stairs. [desperately fast] We split up—you take floors one through five, I'll take six through ten. [Heavy breath] Look for anything unusual: new packages, fresh paint, recently disturbed ceiling tiles.

917 Character 1: [hollow voice] What if there isn't another bomb? [building intensity] What if making us panic and evacuate was the plan? [Dry chuckle] Create chaos, clear the building, then their real team moves in for whatever they're actually after.

Character 2: [coldly professional] Either way, we move. [increasingly urgent] Standing here debating gives them exactly what they want—paralysis through overthinking. [Hiss] I'd rather evacuate for nothing than explain to families why we hesitated over protocol.

918 Character 1: [wavering] You're right, I just— [steadier] The ambassador's suite is on the seventh floor. [Quick exhale] If this is an assassination attempt disguised as a bombing, that's where they'd strike during an evacuation.

Character 2: [grim realization] The panic room. [faster] He'll go straight to his panic room, which they've probably compromised. [Growl] Classic misdirection—make us think bomb when it's really an ambush waiting behind bulletproof glass.

919 Character 1: [exhausted] How did we miss this? [self-reproaching] Years of training, all those simulations, and we fell for a timer made of Christmas lights and duct tape. [Weak laugh] My instructor would be so disappointed right now.

Character 2: [sharp whisper] Stop the pity party. [louder] You hear that? [Tense pause] Footsteps above us—multiple sets, moving fast. Either that's our backup finally arriving, or we're about to have some very unwelcome company.

920 Character 1: [determined] Give me your knife. [hurried] If we can't call for help, we improvise—cut the main power, trigger the backup generators. [Grunt] The fifteen-second blackout might buy us time to reach the ambassador first.

Character 2: [skeptical] That's insane. [more consideringly] Although... darkness would slow them down too. [Sudden energy] Fine, but we do this together—I'm not explaining to headquarters how I let you go rogue with a utility knife.

921 Character 1: [breathless running] Third floor clear! [shouting back] Fourth floor has fresh plaster on the east wall though! [Panting] Could be nothing, could be where they broke through from the adjacent building last night!

Character 2: [distant yell] Forget the plaster! [closer now] I found something—a second timer in the kitchen freezer! [Triumphant exhale] This one's actually counting down: four minutes, seventeen seconds. The real one was hidden in plain sight!

922 Character 1: [stunned silence] Four minutes. [building panic] The kitchen is directly below the conference room where everyone's gathering for evacuation! [Desperate shout] We need to get three hundred people out of there right now!

Character 2: [steely calm] No time for evacuation. [quieter] We defuse it here and now, or we die trying. [Deep breath] Remember Prague? Same wiring configuration. Blue first, then yellow—and pray their bomb maker didn't get creative.

Script: a323cf8c | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Hi, yes, I need to add my baby to our insurance plan? [nervous chuckle] She was born last Tuesday, November 14th, and I—I honestly have no idea how this works. [more frantically] Do I need her Social Security number, because we don't have that yet?

923 Customer Support: Congratulations on your new arrival! Don't worry, this is perfectly normal. I'll help you through everything—can you first provide me your member ID? It should be on your insurance card, starts with XHP, followed by nine digits.

Character 1: [rustling sounds] Oh, okay, let me just... [sighs] Sorry, I haven't slept in four days. [reading slowly] It's XHP-4-7-2-8-3-9-0-1-6. [exhausted] Is that right? Wait, or is that my group number?

924 Customer Support: That's your member ID, perfect! Now, regarding the Social Security number—you have 30 days from birth to add her without it. I'll need the baby's full legal name, birth weight, and the hospital where she was born. [gently] Also, was this your first child?

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Her name is Emma Grace Richardson, born at Valley Medical Center on Oakwood Drive. [proudly] Seven pounds, four ounces! [suddenly worried] But wait—does the 30-day thing mean I'm already late? [panicking] Today is day six, right? Or is it seven?

925 Customer Support: You're absolutely fine, plenty of time left! [typing sounds] Valley Medical Center at 2847 Oakwood Drive, correct? Now, for coverage to begin retroactively from November 14th, I'll need to verify your current plan. Are you on the PPO-500 or the HMO-250?

Character 1: [uncertain] Um, I think it's the PPO? [frustrated groan] My wife usually handles this stuff, but she's obviously recovering. [more confidently] Actually yes, PPO-500, because we specifically chose it for the maternity coverage. [tiredly] The deductible was already met, thankfully.

926 Customer Support: Excellent choice for growing families! Adding Emma will increase your monthly premium by $287.50, effective immediately. Your new family deductible becomes $3,000 instead of $2,000. Would you like to keep the same pediatrician network, or explore our extended care options?

Character 1: [shocked] Two hundred and—wow, okay, babies are expensive even for insurance! [sighs deeply] We'll keep the same network, our pediatrician is Dr. Martinez at the clinic. [confused again] But hold on, when do we get her insurance cards? [urgently] We have her two-week appointment next Monday!

927 Customer Support: [reassuringly] Temporary cards will be emailed within 24 hours to your address on file. That's still jacob.richardson at techflow dot com, correct? [efficiently] Physical cards arrive in 7-10 business days to 458 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. Emma's member ID will be XHP-4-7-2-8-3-9-0-1-6-D for dependent.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank God, yes, that email is right. [suddenly remembering] Actually wait—should I add her to my dental and vision too? [chuckles nervously] Do babies even need vision insurance? [bewildered] She can barely open her eyes half the time!

928 Customer Support: That's a common question! Vision coverage for infants includes important screenings starting at six months. Adding her to dental costs $12 monthly, vision is $8.50. Most parents add both for peace of mind—shall I include those as well?

Character 1: [decisively] Yeah, yes, let's do both—better safe than sorry. [calculating] So that's what, $307 total monthly increase? [sighs] My paternity leave budget just got tighter. [gratefully] But honestly, thank you for making this so easy!

929 Customer Support: Actually $308, but who's counting? You're all set—Emma Grace Richardson is now fully covered. Your confirmation number is BCN-2024-11-20-7743A. Is there anything else regarding the coverage I can help clarify?

Character 1: [writing frantically] BCN-2024—sorry, what was after the 20? [apologetically] My brain is basically mush. [more clearly] 7-7-4-3-A, got it. [thoughtfully] Oh, one more thing—how do prescriptions work for her?

930 Customer Support: The confirmation number is BCN-2024-11-20-7743A, correct! For prescriptions, Emma uses the same pharmacy benefits as you. Your Pharmacy ID is RX-9982-RICH, copays are $10 generic, $30 brand name. [reassuringly] Most infant medications are covered at the generic rate.

Character 1: [writing] RX-9982-RICH, perfect. [suddenly worried] And if—God forbid—we need emergency room visits? [nervously] Not that I'm paranoid, but she made this tiny wheeze yesterday and I almost drove to the ER at 3 AM. [embarrassed laugh] First-time parent syndrome, right?

931 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Completely normal to worry! [calmly] ER visits have a $250 copay, waived if admitted. However, your plan includes a 24/7 nurse hotline—888-NURSE-01. They're wonderful with new parent concerns and can save you those 3 AM panic drives!

Character 1: [gratefully] Oh my God, that number is going straight to speed dial! [relieved sigh] 888-NURSE-01, this might save my sanity. [appreciatively] You've been incredibly helpful, uh—I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name? [sincerely] I'd like to mention you if there's a survey.

932 Customer Support: That's so kind of you! I'm Sarah, employee ID S-4472. [professionally] You should receive a survey email within 48 hours. [cheerfully] Congratulations again on baby Emma, and remember—we're here 24/7 if you need anything else!

Script: b5aa297f | Role: Customer Support

933 Customer Support: [professionally] Good afternoon, how can I help you today? I see you're here about a deposit—let me pull up your account information for you.

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, I deposited a check three days ago and it's—it's still on hold! [louder] I need that money today for my rent, [desperately] this is ridiculous!

934 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir. Let me check the details of that deposit—ah, I see it's a $3,500 check from an out-of-state account, which triggers our standard five-business-day hold policy.

Character 1: [exasperated] Five business days? [sarcastically] Nobody told me about five days when I made the deposit! [groans] How am I supposed to pay my landlord?

935 Customer Support: I'm sorry for the confusion—the teller should have mentioned the hold period. [more quickly] However, I can see you've been a customer for... six years, so let me speak with my manager about a partial release.

Character 1: [impatiently] A partial release? [sighs heavily] I need all of it, not—not just part of it. [demanding] Can't you just override this somehow?

936 Customer Support: Unfortunately, I don't have authority to fully override holds over $2,500. But wait—I can release $1,200 immediately, and the rest will clear tomorrow morning at 9 AM.

Character 1: [skeptically] Tomorrow at nine? [pause] You're absolutely sure about that? [anxiously] Because last time someone told me "tomorrow," it took another three days.

937 Customer Support: Yes sir, I'm marking it in the system right now. The remaining $2,300 will be available tomorrow—I'm actually expediting it from the original hold date. [earnestly] Would you like that in writing?

Character 1: [relieved] Oh, that's—yes, please, I need it in writing. [more calmly] And the twelve hundred, [hopefully] I can withdraw that right now?

938 Customer Support: Absolutely, the $1,200 is available immediately—cash or cashier's check? I'll print the hold release documentation while you decide.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Cash, definitely cash. [chuckles nervously] After this whole mess, I don't trust checks anymore. [curiously] Why do out-of-state checks take so long anyway?

939 Customer Support: [quickly] It's a federal regulation thing—basically fraud prevention for large deposits. Out-of-state checks need extra verification time, but your history with us helped me reduce the hold.

Character 1: [appreciatively] Well, thank you for that, at least. [sighs] I just wish someone had explained this when I deposited it—would've saved me the panic attack this morning.

940 Customer Support: I completely understand, and I'll make a note about the communication issue. Here's your release form, and [briskly] let me count out your twelve hundred for you.

Character 1: [gratefully] Thank you, really. [more relaxed] So tomorrow, nine AM sharp, [confirming] I can get the rest through the ATM or mobile app?

941 Customer Support: ATM, mobile app, in branch—any method works after 9 AM. The system updates overnight, so you'll see the full balance available first thing.

Character 1: [relieved] Perfect, that'll—that'll work. [chuckles] My landlord can wait one more day, I guess. [casually] You've been really helpful, unlike the person who took my deposit.

942 Customer Support: I'm glad I could help resolve this for you. And here's your cash—twelve hundred exactly, would you like an envelope for that?

Character 1: [hastily] Yes, please, an envelope would be great. [more warmly] Thanks again for fixing this mess—I'll definitely be back at nine tomorrow! [laughs] Probably at 9:01, actually.

963 SCENARIO: Casually talking about a skincare product they've been using, then reading ingredients, then finding something they're allergic to that explains recent issues, spiraling into self-inflicted frustration

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, by the way, I've been using that new serum you recommended? The vitamin C one from that brand you're always talking about. It's been pretty good actually, like my skin does feel smoother.

[conversational]

Though I have been breaking out a bit more lately, but I figured it was just, you know, the usual stuff. Stress, not drinking enough water, whatever. [light laugh] The price we pay for being adults, right?

[matter-of-fact]

But I was putting it on this morning and I actually looked at the bottle for once. Like really looked at it, not just grabbed it and squeezed. And I'm reading through all these ingredients I can't pronounce...

[slight concern]

Wait, hold on. [pause] Tocopheryl acetate, hyaluronic acid, and— [stops short] Oh. Oh no. Lanolin? 

[realization dawning]

It has lanolin in it. I'm— I'm allergic to lanolin. I've been allergic to lanolin since I was twelve!

[frustrated]

Are you kidding me right now? I've been putting this on my face for three weeks! Three weeks! [exasperated laugh] No wonder I look like a pepperoni pizza!

[spiraling] [self-directed anger]

How did I not check this? I always check! I'm the person who reads every single label, and the one time I don't— [groan] I'm such an idiot! Sixty dollars down the drain because I can't be bothered to read!
