Character 1: Do you even realize what you do?

631 Character 2: What? What do you—oh god, are you mad at me? Did I do something? I mean, obviously I did something or you wouldn't be—wait, what did I do?

Character 1: You never apologize first. Ever.

632 Character 2: That's not—okay wait wait wait, that's not true! I apologize all the time! Like literally yesterday I said sorry for being late to lunch, and—and last week when I forgot to text you back—

Character 1: After I brought it up.

633 Character 2: No, that's—[nervous laugh] okay maybe that time, but I definitely apologize! I'm like, constantly apologizing for stuff, you know that about me, I'm basically a walking apology most days.

Character 1: Only after I tell you I'm upset. Never on your own.

634 Character 2: Oh. Oh shit, you're—you're right. I just realized—god, I do that, don't I? I wait until you say something and then I'm all "sorry sorry sorry" but I never just... notice on my own. That's really messed up.

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

635 Character 2: I honestly didn't—I mean, that's not an excuse, but I genuinely didn't realize I was doing that. It's like I get so caught up in my own head that I don't even—[sigh] I don't notice when I hurt you until you tell me.

Character 1: Every single time. I have to spell it out.

636 Character 2: That must be so... exhausting. Having to like, constantly explain why you're upset when I should just—I should just know. Or at least check in with you, y'know? Ask if you're okay instead of assuming everything's fine.

Character 1: It makes me feel like you don't care.

637 Character 2: No no no, I care! I care so much, I swear. I just—I'm really bad at reading people sometimes? But that's not—that's my problem to fix, not yours. You shouldn't have to teach me how to be a decent friend.

Character 1: I'm tired of always being the one who has to bring things up.

638 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right and I'm—god, I'm sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. Not just for this but for all the times I made you do the emotional labor of explaining what I did wrong when I should've—I should've been paying attention.

Character 1: I need you to actually try. Not just say you will.

639 Character 2: I will. I mean—no, I hear how that sounds. Let me—[groan] I'm gonna set reminders on my phone to check in with you, ask how you're doing, like actually ask. And I'll try to be more aware when I mess up instead of waiting for you to tell me.

Character 1: That would help. A lot, actually.

640 Character 2: I really am sorry. For this and for... all of it. For making you feel like I don't care, because I do—I care about you so much and I've been a really shitty friend. Thank you for telling me even though you shouldn't have had to.

Script: d67da840_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about what you said yesterday.

641 Character 2: What I—oh, about the outfit thing? Look, I was just trying to help. You always say you wanna know what looks good on you, so I thought—I dunno, I thought I was being a good friend.

Character 1: By telling me I looked "tired" and "washed out"?

642 Character 2: That's not—okay okay, I didn't say it like that. I said that color maybe wasn't the best for your skin tone, which is literally just fashion advice. [Scoff] Everyone says stuff like that.

Character 1: Not everyone. You do.

643 Character 2: Because you ask me! You're always like "does this look okay" and "be honest" and then when I'm actually honest, suddenly I'm the bad guy? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?

Character 1: There's honest and there's cruel.

644 Character 2: Cruel? Are you—wow. Okay. So now I'm cruel for suggesting maybe navy isn't your color. That's where we're at.

Character 1: It's every time we go out. Every single time.

645 Character 2: That's not—that's such an exaggeration and you know it. Sometimes I compliment you! I literally told you last week that dress looked amazing. But I guess you don't remember the good stuff, just the—[frustrated laugh] whatever.

Character 1: "Your hair would look better if." "Have you considered." "Maybe try."

646 Character 2: Oh my god, those are suggestions! I'm trying to—look look, you said you wanted to change up your style. I'm literally just trying to help you figure out what works. That's what friends do.

Character 1: Friends don't make each other feel like shit.

647 Character 2: I didn't—okay, if I made you feel bad, that wasn't what I meant to do. But also, like, you can't ask for my opinion and then get mad when it's not just "you look perfect" every single time. That's not real.

Character 1: I stopped asking months ago.

648 Character 2: You—what? No you didn't. You literally asked me about your jacket last Friday.

Character 1: I said "ready to go?" That's it.

649 Character 2: And I thought—ugh, fine. [Sigh] Maybe I misread that. But I still don't think it's fair that you're acting like I'm some kinda bully when I genuinely thought I was helping. Like, my intentions were good here.

Character 1: Your intentions don't matter when I've asked you to stop.

650 Character 2: When did you—okay, you know what? Fine. Message received. I won't say anything about how you look ever again. Hope that's what you want, because honestly, I don't even know how to be around you if I'm gonna be walking on eggshells all the time.

Script: b359c3c9_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You laughed at my poetry.

651 Character 2: Oh god, no no no—that's not—I wasn't laughing AT it, I swear. It was just the timing of when you read that line about—okay wait, that's making it worse, isn't it?

Character 1: You said it was "cute."

652 Character 2: I didn't mean cute like—like condescending cute! I meant, um, endearing? Like genuinely sweet? [nervous laugh] Okay, I'm realizing how that sounds now and I'm just gonna stop talking.

Character 1: In front of everyone.

653 Character 2: I know, I know, that was—god, that was so stupid of me. I was trying to be supportive but it came out all wrong and then Jake started laughing and I kinda just—I panicked and made it worse somehow.

Character 1: You know how hard it was for me to share that.

654 Character 2: I do. I really, really do, and that's why I feel like such absolute garbage right now. You trusted me with something personal and I just—[groan]—I basically trampled all over it like an idiot.

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

655 Character 2: Listen, I—I've been thinking about this all night, right? And I realized that I do this thing where when I'm uncomfortable with emotional stuff, I kinda deflect with humor? But that's not—that's not an excuse, it's just me being a coward.

Character 1: I've been writing for three years. It's not a joke to me.

656 Character 2: No, of course not! And honestly? Your poetry is actually really good. Like, that line about the ocean and memory? That hit me, y'know? I just—I didn't know how to say that without sounding fake, so I said something stupid instead.

Character 1: So you mock things that make you uncomfortable?

657 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. Which is—that's pretty messed up, isn't it? I'm literally just now realizing how often I probably do that to people.

Character 1: It hurt.

658 Character 2: I know. And I'm—I'm so sorry. Really. I wanna make this right, I just don't know how. Should I tell everyone I was being an ass? Because I will, I'll literally text the group chat right now.

Character 1: That would just make it weird.

659 Character 2: Right, yeah, you're—you're right. Um, what if I just... next time you wanna share something, I promise I'll actually listen? Like really listen, not just wait for my turn to make a dumb joke? [sigh] I know that's not enough but—

Character 1: It's a start, I guess.

660 Character 2: Yeah? Okay. Okay, good. And hey—I meant what I said about the ocean line. That was... that was really beautiful, actually. You're gonna be published someday, I know it.

661 SCENARIO: waiting for the spin cycle to finish

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, fifteen minutes? Twenty? I feel like it's been— it's been forever, but it's probably, uh, probably only been like five minutes or something. [sigh] Why does the spin cycle take so— why does it take so long?

[slightly impatient]

I mean, it's just spinning, right? It's not like it's, um, it's not like it's doing anything complicated. Just, uh, just spin the water out and we're done. But no, it has to do this whole— this whole dramatic buildup thing where it goes slow, then fast, then it stops, then it— [groan] come on.

[conversational]

I could be doing other stuff right now. I could be, um, I could be folding the stuff from yesterday that's still sitting in the, uh, in the basket. But instead I'm just standing here like— like some kind of laundry sentinel or whatever.

[resigned, slightly amused]

Although, I mean, if I walk away now it's gonna finish the second I leave. That's just— that's just how these things work, right? Murphy's law of laundry or something. [laugh] Okay, okay, I'll just wait another— oh, there it goes. Finally.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 6984f796 | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [trembling voice] I keep thinking this isn't real, that tomorrow you'll still be here. [Shaky breath] We've been through everything together since we were kids, and now [voice breaking] I don't know how to do this without you.

662 Character 2: [quietly] Hey, come here. [warm but sad] It's not forever—eighteen months will fly by, I promise. [Deep sigh] Remember when we thought summer camp was the end of the world? This is just [pause] a longer version of that.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Summer camp didn't involve bullets and bombs. [more desperately] What if something happens and I never get to tell you how much you mean to me? [Choked sob] What if our last conversation is about something stupid?

663 Character 2: [firmly] Nothing's going to happen to me. [softer now] But if it makes you feel better, let's promise—no stupid conversations from here on out. [slight chuckle] Though technically, that eliminates about ninety percent of what we usually talk about together.

Character 1: [through tears] Remember the treehouse? [nostalgic whisper] We swore we'd live there forever, just the two of us against the world. [Sniffling] Sometimes I wish we could go back to being eight and believing that was actually possible.

664 Character 2: [wistfully] I still have that terrible drawing we made of it. [getting thicker] The one where we gave it rocket boosters? [voice cracking] God, I'm taking it with me—need something to remind me what I'm fighting to come back to.

Character 1: [suddenly urgent] Promise me you'll write. [rapid words] Real letters, not just emails—something I can hold when everything feels too empty here. [pleading] Even if it's just one line saying you're okay, that you're still you.

665 Character 2: [steadier] Every week, without fail. [in measured tones] I'll tell you about the boring stuff too—what I ate, how hot it is, [softer] all the mundane details that'll make you roll your eyes and feel normal.

Character 1: [angry suddenly] This is so unfair! [louder] Why does it have to be you? There are millions of people in this country. [Breaking down] But no, my best friend has to be the hero. [Bitter sob] I hate this.

666 Character 2: [gently] I'm not trying to be a hero. [more seriously] Someone has to do it, and I'd rather it be me than someone who has nobody waiting for them. [pause] At least I know I have something worth coming home for.

Character 1: [hollow whisper] Your mom made me promise to look after your dog. [trying to smile] Like I wouldn't have stolen him anyway. [voice wobbling] He's going to sleep on your pillow every night until you come back to claim him properly.

667 Character 2: [laughing weakly] He'll be so spoiled by then. [more emotional] Thank you for that, for taking care of things here. [quieter] It makes leaving a tiny bit easier, knowing you'll keep my life warm for me while I'm gone.

Character 1: [desperate] What if you change? [faster] What if the person who comes back isn't the one who left? [Ragged breath] What if we can't find our way back to this, to us, to everything we've built together here?

668 Character 2: [confidently] The core of me isn't going anywhere. [thoughtful tone] Yeah, I might see things that change me, but [firmly] the part that's your best friend? That's carved in stone. [whispered] That's the part I'll protect most over there.

Character 1: [exhausted] I brought you something. [rustling sounds] It's stupid, just that keychain from the arcade—[voice lifting] remember when we spent forty dollars trying to win it? [Soft laugh] Figured you could use some good luck from our misspent youth.

669 Character 2: [touched] Are you kidding? This is perfect. [getting emotional] I can't believe you kept it all these years. [Shaky exhale] Now I'll have to come back—can't leave you without your half of our legendary arcade victory, can I?

Character 1: [suddenly clear] When you come back, we're taking that road trip. [building energy] No excuses, no delays—straight to the coast like we always planned. [fiercely] Two weeks of terrible music and gas station coffee, and absolutely no talk about any of this.

670 Character 2: [matching energy] Deal. You better start making the playlist now. [lighter] I want twenty hours of music minimum, and at least [chuckling] three songs that'll make us cry for good reasons. [pause] Happy tears only on that trip, agreed?

Character 1: [breaking completely] I love you, you know that right? [through sobs] Not romantically, just—you're my person, my family. [gasping] The thought of this world without you in it makes me feel like I'm drowning in advance.

671 Character 2: [voice thick] I love you too. [pulling together] And hey, I'm too stubborn to not come back. [watery laugh] You're stuck with me for at least sixty more years. [whispered promise] This is just a chapter, not the ending.

--- CS ALPHANUMERIC ---

Script: d3d1f93f | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [whispered] So, I've got this... situation with my business expenses from 2023. [nervously] I run a consulting firm at 4782 Shadow Lane, but some receipts are, uh, [pause] let's say creatively documented.

672 Customer Support: I see, Mr...? [expectant pause] Well, IRS Publication 535 outlines legitimate business deductions. Every expense needs proper documentation—receipts, invoices, bank statements showing the transaction occurred.

Character 1: [defensive] Look, my company ID is XB-77291-K, totally legitimate! [quieter] But sometimes clients pay in cash for, you know, discrete advisory services. [sighs] Can't I just estimate based on my calendar?

673 Customer Support: Cash transactions still require documentation, sir. The IRS expects contemporaneous records—that means written logs from when the expense actually happened, not reconstructed months later.

Character 1: [frustrated] Okay, okay, but what about entertainment expenses? [hopefully] I took clients to that club on Riverside—$3,847 in January alone! [chuckles nervously] Business development is expensive these days, right?

674 Customer Support: Entertainment deductions are... complicated post-2017 tax reform. Most entertainment isn't deductible anymore unless it's directly on your business premises or for the benefit of employees.

Character 1: [disappointed] Employees, right... speaking of which, my assistant's salary—$85,000 annually. [more eagerly] She also happens to be my cousin, but she really does work! [defensive] Twenty hours a week, at least.

675 Customer Support: Related party transactions face extra scrutiny. You'll need timesheets, job descriptions, proof the salary matches market rates for similar positions. The IRS loves auditing family employment arrangements.

Character 1: [anxiously] What about my home office then? [quickly] I use 2 out of 8 rooms exclusively for business—that's 25% of my mortgage, utilities, everything! [hopeful whisper] That's completely legitimate, isn't it?

676 Customer Support: [measured] The home office deduction requires exclusive and regular use for business. [carefully] If those rooms serve any personal purpose—even storing holiday decorations—[pause] the deduction could be disallowed entirely.

Character 1: [irritated] Fine, fine, but travel expenses? [defensive] I flew to Vegas six times last year for "conferences"—code TRV-892B on my expense tracker. [muttering] Networking happens everywhere, doesn't it?

677 Customer Support: Business travel requires a primary business purpose for the trip. Attending a two-hour seminar doesn't justify deducting a five-day Vegas stay. The IRS examines the proportion of business versus personal time.

Character 1: [desperate] Come on, there must be something! [pleading] What about charitable contributions—I gave $15,000 to the, uh, Save the Pigeons Foundation. [quieter] My buddy runs it from his garage.

678 Customer Support: Charitable deductions require donations to IRS-recognized 501(c)(3) organizations. You can verify status using Tax ID numbers on the IRS website. Garage-based operations rarely qualify.

Character 1: [defeated] This is impossible! [frustrated groan] My quarterly payments are already killing me—$12,000 each to account 98-4455-TX. [sarcastically] Maybe I should just claim my yacht as a second office?

679 Customer Support: Please don't do that! Yachts as offices trigger immediate red flags unless you're legitimately in marine transportation. Sir, aggressive deductions increase audit risk exponentially.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Audit risk, huh? [curious] What if I keep everything under those automatic thresholds—you know, $599 here, $598 there? [hopefully] They can't track everything, right?

680 Customer Support: That's called structuring, and it's actually worse than claiming large amounts properly! The IRS has algorithms that detect payment splitting patterns. This conversation is making me very uncomfortable.

Character 1: [backtracking] No, no, I'm just thinking out loud! [nervously laughing] Hey, what about professional fees—can I deduct what I'm paying you for this consultation? [hopeful] Invoice number PRO-2024-333?

681 Customer Support: Yes, tax preparation and planning fees are generally deductible for businesses. That's one deduction you won't have to worry about. Now, shall we focus on organizing your legitimate expenses properly?

Script: bfeddc6f | Role: Customer Support

682 Customer Support: Good afternoon, SecureShield Systems, this is Marcus speaking. How can I assist you today with your security concerns?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I'm calling about the—the alarm system that keeps going off. [sighs heavily] It's happened four times this week, and I'm... I'm just exhausted from dealing with this.

683 Customer Support: I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing these issues. Let me pull up your account right away—may I have your account number or the address associated with the system?

Character 1: [impatiently] It's 4782 Maple Avenue, account ending in 3967. [more agitated] The neighbors are starting to complain, and honestly, I don't blame them—it went off at 3 AM last night!

684 Customer Support: Oh my, 3 AM, that's completely unacceptable. I see here you have our Premium Package with motion sensors and... yes, I'm seeing multiple false alarm reports this week.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Multiple? Try constant! [groans] The thing goes off when my cat walks by, when the heat kicks on—yesterday it triggered because of a spider, a SPIDER!

685 Customer Support: [reassuringly] I completely understand your frustration, and we're going to fix this immediately. It looks like your sensitivity settings might be too high—we can adjust those remotely right now, actually.

Character 1: [skeptically] You've said that before though. [sighs] Last month someone supposedly "fixed" it, and here we are... [desperately] I just need it to work properly without terrifying my family every other night.

686 Customer Support: You're absolutely right to be upset about this recurring issue. I'm going to do two things—first, recalibrate your sensors now, and second, I'll waive this month's monitoring fee for the inconvenience.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh, well that's... that's actually helpful. [more calmly] But what if it keeps happening? I can't keep going through this cycle of false alarms and temporary fixes.

687 Customer Support: If these adjustments don't resolve it completely, we'll send our senior technician out—no charge. He'll replace any faulty sensors and do a full system diagnostic within 48 hours, guaranteed.

Character 1: [relieved] Okay, that sounds more like it. [cautiously] And you're sure this technician actually knows what they're doing? Because the last guy seemed... confused by my setup.

688 Customer Support: Tom Harrison will be your technician—fifteen years experience, handles all our complex cases. He's actually our trainer for new techs, so you'll be in excellent hands, I promise.

Character 1: [sighs] Alright, I guess that's fair. [more cooperatively] So you're adjusting the settings now? Should I test it somehow, or... how do we know it's working?

689 Customer Support: Great question! The changes are processing now—should take about thirty seconds—then I'll have you do a walk-through test while I monitor from here.

Character 1: [chuckles dryly] A walk-through test, sure. [tiredly] Just promise me this won't involve me crawling around pretending to be a burglar like the last technician suggested.

690 Customer Support: No, definitely not! Just normal walking past the sensors, nothing theatrical required—we're testing for everyday movement, not auditioning for a heist movie.

Character 1: [more relaxed] Good, because my acting skills are terrible. [thoughtfully] You know what, Marcus, you've been really helpful—much better than my last three calls about this.

691 Customer Support: Thank you so much for saying that. Okay, settings are updated—whenever you're ready, just walk through your living room normally, and I'll watch the readings here.

Character 1: [cooperatively] Alright, walking now... past the front sensor, through the hallway... [hopefully] And? Please tell me we're not setting off the entire neighborhood again.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

692 [Disappointed] Look, I've been trying to, um, trying to be nice about this, but you keep—you just keep pushing. [Sigh]

693 [Fast] Okay so basically what I'm saying is I need space, like actual space, not this weird thing where you text me every five minutes! [Angry]

694 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, just show up at my work again, that's totally normal friend behavior. [Tsk]

695 [Slow] I value our friendship, I really do, but, uh, but this is getting to be too much, you know? [Sad]

696 [Whisper] Can we just—can we talk about why you always gotta make everything about you? [Disappointed] [Sigh]

697 [Happy] Hey, I figured out a solution—we hang out once a week, scheduled, and that's it! [Chuckle] No more surprise visits!

698 [Shout] I said NO, okay? [Angry] That's a complete sentence, and I, I dunno why you can't respect that!

699 [Sad] You're kinda suffocating me here, and I—I hate that I have to say this out loud. [Slow]

700 [Fast] [Sarcastic] Right, because clearly my opinion doesn't matter when you've already decided what we're doing this weekend, again.

701 [Disappointed] I thought you'd understand when I said I needed—actually, why am I even explaining myself? [Tsk] This is exhausting.

702 [Whisper] Sometimes I literally hide when I see your car pull up. [Sad] [Sigh] That's not normal, is it?

703 [Angry] You went through my phone? [Shout] Are you—that's so far over the line, I can't even!

704 [Chuckle] Remember when we used to have, like, separate lives? [Happy] Yeah, let's, um, let's bring that back.

705 [Slow] [Disappointed] I'm gonna need you to stop calling my mom when I don't answer your texts, that's just... wow.

706 [Fast] So here's the thing—wait, no, let me finish—I get to decide who I hang out with and when! [Angry]

707 [Sarcastic] I mean, I guess boundaries are just suggestions to you, huh? [Laugh] Must be nice living in your world.

708 [Sad] This friendship used to be, er, it used to be fun, but now it feels like a full-time job. [Slow] [Sigh]

709 [Happy] You know what? I'm actually proud of myself for finally saying this! [Fast] I need Tuesday nights to myself, period!

710 [Whisper] [Disappointed] I shouldn't have to lock my door to get five minutes alone, but here we are.

711 [Groan] Honestly, if you show up uninvited one more time, I'm just—I'm done, okay? [Angry] I'm completely done.

712 SCENARIO: Offhandedly describing a time they didn't hold the door for someone, then remembering who it was, then realizing it was someone they know and it definitely seemed intentional, ending in rudeness anxiety

==================================================

[casual]

So I'm, um, I'm leaving the coffee shop earlier and there's this person behind me, right? And I just— I don't know, I was, uh, I was on my phone or whatever, so I just, um, I just let the door close. You know? Not like, uh, not intentionally or anything, I just— [shrug] it happens.

[matter-of-fact]

But then I'm thinking about it now and I'm like, wait, who— who was that person? Because I feel like I, um, I feel like I recognized them from somewhere, you know? Like the, uh, the back of their head looked familiar or something.

[slight concern]

And now I'm trying to remember and I think— oh god, I think it might have been that girl from, um, from my marketing class? Sarah? The one with the, uh, the really curly hair who always sits in the front row?

[growing anxiety]

Oh no. Oh no, no, no. It was— it was definitely her. She was wearing that, um, that green jacket she always wears. [nervous laugh] And she probably saw me look back, didn't she? She probably thinks I, uh, I saw her and just— just let it slam in her face.

[spiraling]

God, what if she thinks I did it on purpose? What if she's telling people I'm, um, I'm some kind of door-slamming psychopath? [groan] I have to sit next to her tomorrow in class and she probably thinks I, uh, I hate her or something!

[frantic]

Should I text her? Do I even have her number? Oh my god, what if she posts about it? "Some girl from my class is literally, um, literally the rudest person alive." [whimper] I'm never leaving my apartment again.
