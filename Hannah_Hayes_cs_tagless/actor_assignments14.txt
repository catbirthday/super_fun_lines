Character 1: So that jacket sold.

1093 Character 2: Oh the—wait, the one you were working on? The denim one with all the, um, the embroidery stuff?

Character 1: Yeah. For twelve hundred.

1094 Character 2: I'm sorry—twelve? Twelve HUNDRED? [Gasp] Are you actually serious right now? That's like—wait wait wait, you bought that for what, twenty bucks?

Character 1: Fifteen.

1095 Character 2: Fifteen dollars and you just—okay, okay I need to sit down. That's literally insane profit margins, like that's what, almost eighty times what you paid?

Character 1: Something like that.

1096 Character 2: And you're just—you're so calm about this! I'd be like, screaming, honestly. How long did it even take you to do all the work on it?

Character 1: Maybe ten hours total.

1097 Character 2: So you basically made over a hundred dollars an hour? That's—I mean, that's more than lawyers make sometimes, y'know? [Laugh] Should I be calling you CEO now or—

Character 1: It's just one sale.

1098 Character 2: No no no, don't do that thing where you like, minimize your success. This is huge! Are you gonna—I mean, are you thinking about doing more? Making it a real business?

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe.

1099 Character 2: Because like, you clearly have the eye for it, right? And the skills—I couldn't even sew a button if my life depended on it, honestly.

Character 1: Buttons aren't that hard.

1100 Character 2: Okay but that's—that's exactly my point! [Chuckle] To you it's nothing, but you've got this whole talent that people will literally pay twelve hundred dollars for.

Character 1: Feels weird taking that much money for old clothes.

1101 Character 2: Um, excuse me? You didn't just sell old clothes—you made art, basically. That person saw the value in what you created, y'know? They wanted it that badly.

Character 1: Yeah. They messaged me about doing a custom piece too.

1102 Character 2: Wait WHAT? They want—okay buried the lead much? That's incredible! You're gonna do it, right? Please tell me you're gonna at least consider it because this could be like, your actual thing.

Script: ef0a10ef_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I passed the bar.

1103 Character 2: Wait wait wait—WHAT? You passed the—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like, you're actually gonna be a lawyer? This is—this is huge!

Character 1: Yeah. Found out this morning.

1104 Character 2: And you're just—you're just sitting there like it's nothing? [Laugh] I mean, holy shit, do you know how many people fail that thing? Like, the first time especially?

Character 1: Sixty percent pass rate, actually.

1105 Character 2: Okay but still—still! You're in that sixty percent! We should be, I dunno, popping champagne or something. How do you feel? Like, honestly?

Character 1: Relieved, I guess. Tired.

1106 Character 2: Yeah no, I bet you're—god, you've been studying for like, what, three months straight? Every single day. Your brain must be completely fried right now.

Character 1: Something like that.

1107 Character 2: Have you told your parents yet? Because your mom is gonna—[Gasp] oh she's gonna absolutely lose it. In like, the best way possible, y'know?

Character 1: Haven't called them. You're the first.

1108 Character 2: I'm the—wait, really? You told me first? That's... okay that's actually really sweet. But also like, you gotta call them! They've been so worried about you.

Character 1: I know. I will.

1109 Character 2: Are you—okay, can I ask something? You seem kinda... I dunno, not as excited as I thought you'd be? Which is totally fine, I'm just—

Character 1: It doesn't feel real yet.

1110 Character 2: Oh totally, totally. That makes sense. It's probably like—what's that thing called? Post-exam weird empty feeling? When you've been working toward something for so long and then suddenly it's just... done?

Character 1: Yeah. Exactly that.

1111 Character 2: Well I'm—I'm proud of you. Like, genuinely so proud. You worked your ass off for this and you did it. [Softer] You actually did it.

Character 1: Thanks. Means a lot.

1112 Character 2: So um, when do you get to like—when's the swearing in ceremony thing? Because I'm definitely coming to that, just so you know. Non-negotiable.

Script: 20ee3626_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I got invited to show at the Riverside Art Fair.

1113 Character 2: Wait wait wait—are you serious? That's like, that's huge! Oh my god, I mean, do you even realize how competitive that is? They only pick like what, thirty artists?

Character 1: Twenty-five.

1114 Character 2: Twenty—okay that's even more insane! How are you so calm right now? I'd be literally bouncing off the walls. When did you find out?

Character 1: Yesterday. Still processing.

1115 Character 2: Of course you are, I mean—this is kinda life-changing stuff, y'know? Like, galleries scout at Riverside. Real ones. [Laugh] God, I'm getting nervous for you and it's not even my thing.

Character 1: That's the problem. What if my stuff isn't ready?

1116 Character 2: Okay no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. Your work is incredible and you know it. Actually, you probably don't know it because you're like, chronically modest, but trust me on this one.

Character 1: I've never shown this many pieces at once. It's different.

1117 Character 2: Well yeah, obviously it's—I mean, it's gonna feel different because it IS different. But isn't that kinda... good? Like you're finally getting the space you deserve?

Character 1: Space costs money. Booth fees, transport, insurance. It adds up.

1118 Character 2: Oh. Oh shit, I didn't even—[Sigh] okay yeah, the business side is rough. But like, can't you get sponsors or something? My cousin did that crowdfunding thing for her gallery show.

Character 1: Maybe. I don't know. Feels weird asking for money.

1119 Character 2: It's not weird, it's literally how artists survive! Everyone does it. Actually wait—doesn't your job have that arts grant program? The one where they—you know what I'm talking about?

Character 1: They discontinued it last year.

1120 Character 2: Of course they did, because why would they actually support—ugh, sorry. I'm just frustrated for you. This should be pure celebration and instead you're stressed about logistics.

Character 1: It's fine. I'll figure it out. Always do.

1121 Character 2: You will, you totally will, but like—let people help? Please? I know you hate that but honestly, we all wanna see you succeed. This is such a big deal.

Character 1: Thanks. Really. Just need to sit with it for a bit.

1122 Character 2: Yeah, no, totally get that. Just—promise me you won't talk yourself out of it? Because this is your thing, this is what you've been working toward for like, years now. [Softer] You deserve this.

Script: 106055b9_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I heard about the promotion. From Derek.

1123 Character 2: Oh. Um, okay—look, I was gonna tell you, I swear, I just... I wasn't ready to tell anyone yet, y'know? It literally just happened like two weeks ago and I'm still processing it myself.

Character 1: Two weeks.

1124 Character 2: Yeah, I know how that sounds, but—[sigh] honestly, I haven't told anyone. Derek only knows 'cause he works in HR and saw the paperwork. That's not me choosing to tell him over you.

Character 1: You could've told me you weren't ready to talk about it.

1125 Character 2: How? How was I supposed to—"Hey, I have big news but I can't tell you"? Come on, that's not... that's not how conversations work. You would've just pushed until I told you anyway.

Character 1: So you just said nothing instead.

1126 Character 2: I didn't—okay okay, fine, I didn't bring it up. But it's my news, right? Like, I get to decide when I'm ready to share it. [frustrated laugh] I'm not obligated to immediately broadcast every single thing that happens in my life.

Character 1: We talked three times last week. You never mentioned it once.

1127 Character 2: Because I wasn't ready! I just—I dunno, I needed time to figure out what this means for me, for my life, before everyone starts having opinions about it. Is that really so terrible?

Character 1: I'm not "everyone."

1128 Character 2: No, you're not, but you're also—look look, you know how you get. You would've immediately started planning my whole future, telling me what apartment to get, how to negotiate, and I just... I needed to sit with it first.

Character 1: Right. Because I'm so overbearing.

1129 Character 2: That's not—[groan] that's not what I'm saying and you know it. You care, I get it, but sometimes caring means giving people space to process their own stuff, y'know? Not everything has to be a joint decision.

Character 1: I would've given you space if you'd asked.

1130 Character 2: Would you though? Really? 'Cause last time I tried to keep something to myself—remember my dad's surgery?—you literally got mad that I was being "distant" and "shutting you out."

Character 1: That was different.

1131 Character 2: How? How was it different? I needed time then, I needed time now. But apparently I'm just—I'm the bad friend either way, right? I either share too much or not enough. There's literally no winning with you sometimes.

Character 1: At least I don't lie by omission.

1132 Character 2: Okay, you know what? Fine fine, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the promotion the second it happened. But I'm not gonna apologize for needing time to process my own life. [scoff] That's not lying, that's just... being human.

1133 SCENARIO: discovering the thing they bought went on sale the next day

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh, you've got to be— you've got to be kidding me. The, um, the speaker I bought yesterday is literally— it's literally forty percent off today. Forty percent! [sigh] I mean, what are the, uh, what are the odds?

[slightly incredulous]

I was so proud of myself too, like, "Oh good job, you actually, um, you actually did the research this time." Looked at reviews, compared prices, the whole— the whole thing. And now it's, uh— [groan] now it's basically half price.

[faster, working through it]

Okay, so, um, so what can I do here? I could return it, right? But then I'd have to, uh, I'd have to drive all the way back, wait in that line again, and then— and then rebuy the exact same thing? That seems, um, that seems kind of ridiculous.

[contemplative]

I mean, it's not like I— it's not like I can't afford it. It's just the principle, you know? Like, why does this always— why does this always happen to me? [tsk] It's like the universe has, um, has terrible timing.

[resigned, trailing off]

Whatever. I guess that's just... that's just how it goes. The speaker works fine, I like it, so, um... I'll just pretend I never saw the sale. Right. Easy enough.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: d15ca656 | Role: Character 1 (A)

1134 Character 1: [breathless] Marcus, look at those towers! [louder] They're completely intact after all these centuries. [Gasping] The golden inscriptions are still glowing somehow—this changes everything we thought we knew about the Aztari civilization and their technology.

Character 2: [whispered awe] I can't believe we actually found it. [trembling] Twenty years of searching, and here it stands. [Sharp intake] Wait—do you see those symbols moving on the walls? They're shifting like they're alive or something.

1135 Character 1: [urgently] We need to document everything before the sun sets! [excited squeal] Oh my God, that's a perfectly preserved astronomical calendar! [faster pace] Quick, hand me the camera—no archaeologist has ever seen craftsmanship this intricate before in pre-Columbian ruins!

Character 2: [nervous laugh] Should we really be touching anything? [quieter] This place feels... sacred, almost watchful. [Long exhale] The air tastes different here, metallic and ancient, like breathing in centuries of untold secrets waiting to be discovered.

1136 Character 1: [dismissively] Don't be superstitious now! [enthusiastic shout] This is the discovery of the millennium! [Chuckle] Though I admit, those statues do seem to follow you with their eyes—probably just clever architectural angles designed to intimidate visitors.

Character 2: [hushed reverence] Listen to that humming sound coming from the temple. [more slowly] It's almost like a heartbeat, rhythmic and deep. [Soft gasp] The entire structure must be hollow inside—imagine what treasures could be waiting in there!

1137 Character 1: [determined] Then let's go investigate the inner chambers. [wavering slightly] Although... why are there no signs of decay anywhere? [thoughtfully] Even the fabric banners are pristine, as if someone's been maintaining this place all along.

Character 2: [fearful whisper] Marcus, there are fresh footprints in the dust over there. [voice rising] Someone's been here recently—very recently. [Nervous giggle] Maybe we should radio base camp first, let them know what we've found before proceeding any further.

1138 Character 1: [mockingly] And risk someone else claiming our discovery? [firm tone] Absolutely not happening! [Excited yelp] Besides, look at that jade altar—it's covered in hieroglyphs we've never seen before! This could rewrite history books completely!

Character 2: [amazed] You're right, these symbols predate anything in our databases. [getting quieter] They almost look alien in origin. [Whistles softly] The precision of these carvings would be impossible even with modern tools—how did they achieve this?

1139 Character 1: [contemplative] What if they had help we don't understand? [more excitedly] The legends always spoke of sky visitors! [Heavy breathing] That doorway ahead is opening on its own—the mechanisms still work after all this time somehow!

Character 2: [panicked] That's impossible! Stone doesn't move by itself! [calmer] Unless there's some kind of counterweight system we triggered. [Shaky exhale] Either way, that chamber beyond looks untouched—we could be the first humans inside for millennia.

1140 Character 1: [triumphantly] Then what are we waiting for? [softer] History is calling our names! [Delighted squeak] Can you imagine the academic papers, the lectures, the complete revolution in archaeological understanding this will bring to our field?

Character 2: [reluctantly] Fine, but we stick together no matter what. [steadier voice] And if anything seems dangerous, we leave immediately. [Sharp laugh] Though I doubt ancient booby traps are still functional after all this time has passed.

1141 Character 1: [sarcastically] Famous last words, my friend! [playful tone] But you're probably right about the traps. [Gasps loudly] Oh wow, the walls in here are covered in pure gold leaf—this wealth is absolutely staggering to behold!

Character 2: [stunned silence] That's not just gold—those are star maps! [increasingly excited] Incredibly detailed astronomical charts! [Choking up] They knew about star systems we only discovered with telescopes—this knowledge shouldn't have been possible back then!

1142 Character 1: [mysteriously] Unless they had telescopes we haven't found yet. [more intensely] Or something even better. [Nervous laughter] That pedestal in the center is holding something—it's glowing with its own light source, pulsing like it's alive!

Character 2: [barely audible] Should we touch it? [stronger] Every instinct says no, but scientifically... [Trail off] The energy readings on my equipment are going absolutely crazy—whatever that thing is, it's still active and generating power somehow.

1143 Character 1: [resolutely] We came here to make history! [gentler] Whatever happens, we do this together. [Deep breath] On three, we both reach for it—one, two—wait, do you hear those footsteps echoing behind us now?

Character 2: [terrified whisper] Those aren't our footsteps, Marcus. [voice cracking] Someone's coming up the passage behind us. [Panicked gasp] The door we came through—it's sealing itself! We're trapped in here with whatever's approaching us right now!

Script: d305baa4 | Role: Character 1

1144 Character 1: [confused] Excuse me, um, I'm trying to use this AR thing on my phone but—[frustrated sigh]—nothing's happening when I point it at product SKU-4478B. [hesitantly] Is there like a specific angle I need or something?

1144 Customer Support: Hello! I see you're having trouble with our AR feature. [reassuring tone] First, make sure you've enabled camera permissions in settings—that's under menu ID 3.2A. Are you seeing the blue scanning frame appear at all?

Character 1: [relieved] Oh wait, yeah, there's a frame now! [excitedly] But it keeps saying "calibration needed" and—[groans]—the percentage just stuck at 47%. Should I try moving to aisle 12-B instead where the lighting's better?

1145 Customer Support: Ah, calibration issues are common in low-light areas. [more enthusiastically] Try holding your device exactly 8 to 10 inches from the product barcode. [patiently] Once it hits 100%, you'll see option code V-2.0 for virtual try-on appear.

Character 1: [amazed] Whoa, it just—it worked! [laughs nervously] I can see the sofa in my living room now, but um, the color looks weird? [puzzled tone] Like it's showing beige but the tag says item color BLU-445?

1146 Customer Support: Sometimes our AR renderer has sync issues with color hex codes. Can you tap the refresh icon—it's the circular arrow near coordinate X234-Y556? That should load the correct texture file, version 3.1.4.

Character 1: [frustrated groan] Now the whole thing crashed and there's an error—[reading slowly] "Exception at memory address 0x7B4A." [sarcastically] Super helpful, right? My session ID was, uh, let me check... AS-99412-K if that matters?

1147 Customer Support: Oh dear, that's a cache overflow error. Don't worry though—just force-close the app and clear your temporary files. When you restart, use quick-scan mode QS-7 instead of the default enhanced mode.

Character 1: [skeptically] Okay, it's back up but—[surprised gasp]—wow, there's like twenty different furniture pieces floating everywhere! [bewildered] Is this supposed to happen with multi-scan batch MRX-200, or did I break something at coordinates 41.2, -73.8?

1148 Customer Support: You've activated our showroom mode by accident! Double-tap with two fingers to exit, then select single-item view SIV-1. [reassuringly] Your location data and all 20 scanned items are saved under profile reference PRF-8823-QM though.

Script: 327bfee2 | Role: Customer Support

1149 Customer Support: Good afternoon, thank you for calling TechNet Support, my name is Sarah. How can I assist you today with your internet service?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi Sarah, look—this is the FIFTH time my internet's gone out this month. [sighs heavily] I work from home, and I'm... I'm honestly at my breaking point here.

1150 Customer Support: Oh, I completely understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account right away—can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Character 1: [irritated] It's 555-0147, and before you ask, yes, I've already unplugged the router. [sarcastically] I've done the whole song and dance—waited thirty seconds, plugged it back in, nothing works.

1151 Customer Support: Perfect, I see your account here, Mr. Davidson. [concerned] You're right, I'm seeing multiple outage reports and... wow, five incidents is definitely not acceptable. Let me check what's happening in your area.

Character 1: [exasperated] Every single time someone says they'll fix it permanently, yet here we are again. [groans] Do you people even keep notes about previous calls, or do I need to explain everything from scratch?

1152 Customer Support: I absolutely see all your previous calls documented here, Mr. Davidson. It looks like there's been ongoing maintenance in your area that's been... well, poorly coordinated. This shouldn't have affected you this many times.

Character 1: [angrily] Poorly coordinated? That's the understatement of the year! [louder] I've lost three clients because of dropped video calls—this is costing me actual money, not just inconvenience.

1153 Customer Support: That's completely unacceptable, and I want to escalate this immediately. I'm going to transfer you to our technical escalation team, but first—I'm applying a credit for this entire month's service to your account.

Character 1: [skeptically] A credit is nice and all, but what I really need is reliable internet. [sighs] Can someone actually come out today? Like, an actual technician who knows what they're doing?

1154 Customer Support: Yes, absolutely, I'm scheduling priority dispatch right now. [confidently] We'll have our senior technician there between 2 and 4 PM today—not tomorrow, today. They'll check your line from the pole to your modem.

Character 1: [cautiously] Senior technician, that sounds promising, I guess. [tiredly] The last guy just... he looked at the box outside for two minutes and said everything was fine. [chuckles bitterly] Clearly, it wasn't.

1155 Customer Support: This technician will do a complete diagnostic, I promise you that. [rapidly] They'll test signal strength, check for interference, inspect all connections, and replace any questionable equipment. We're treating this as a critical issue.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Okay, okay, that's... that's actually more thorough than usual. [hesitantly] Should I be home for this, or can they access everything from outside?

1156 Customer Support: Someone should be home—they'll need to test your internal connections too. The technician will call you thirty minutes before arrival, and I'm also... I'm waiving any service fees for this visit.

Character 1: [relieved] Well, that's something at least. [more firmly] But Sarah, if this happens again next week, I'm switching providers. [sighs] Five years as a customer should mean something, right?

1157 Customer Support: [earnestly] It absolutely does mean something, Mr. Davidson. I'm personally flagging your account for our regional manager's review, and—I'm giving you my direct extension for any future issues.

Character 1: [surprised] Your direct extension? That's... well, that's actually helpful. [cautiously optimistic] Maybe you guys are finally taking this seriously then.

1158 Customer Support: We are, one hundred percent. Extension 4782, ask for Sarah, I'm here Monday through Friday. I'll also call you tomorrow to confirm everything was resolved properly.

Character 1: [appreciatively] Alright Sarah, I'll... I'll give you one more shot here. [more calmly] Thanks for actually listening instead of just reading from a script. [sighs] See you at 2 PM, I suppose.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1159 [Angry] This is—oh come ON, not now, not TODAY of all days! [Groan] They're gonna be here in, what, twenty minutes?

1160 [Fast] Okay okay okay, where's the plunger, where did I—it's gotta be around here somewhere, right? [Tsk]

1161 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, yeah, this is exactly how I wanted to spend my afternoon. [Sigh] Just me and the toilet having a moment.

1162 [Whisper] Please, please just go down, I'm literally begging you right now.

1163 [Happy] Wait, I think it's actually—yes! [Laugh] Oh thank god, it's finally working!

1164 [Disappointed] I, um, I really thought that would fix it, but it's still just... sitting there. [Sigh]

1165 [Shout] Can someone grab me the—actually, never mind, I'll get it myself!

1166 [Slow] You know what, maybe if I just, like, wait a few minutes it'll kinda resolve itself?

1167 [Sad] This is so embarrassing, I mean, what am I gonna tell them when they need to use the bathroom? [Groan]

1168 [Fast] [Angry] I don't have time for this, I really don't have—ugh, why is nothing working?!

1169 [Chuckle] Honestly, this would be funny if it wasn't, you know, literally about to ruin my entire party.

1170 [Whisper] [Slow] Just gonna try one more time, nice and easy, no sudden movements.

1171 [Disappointed] The plumber said he can't get here until tomorrow, so that's, uh, that's not gonna help. [Tsk]

1172 [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Great, now there's water on the floor too—this just keeps getting better!

1173 [Happy] [Fast] My neighbor has a snake thingy, she said I can borrow it right now!

1174 [Angry] [Shout] Who puts an entire roll of paper towels in here?! WHO DOES THAT?!

1175 [Slow] [Sad] I guess we could just, um, put an out of order sign on it?

1176 [Fast] Google says baking soda and vinegar, but like, do I even have time to—okay, worth a shot.

1177 [Disappointed] [Sigh] Seven people coming over and one working bathroom—this is gonna be a disaster, isn't it?

1178 [Happy] [Chuckle] You know what, forget it, we're just gonna laugh about this later, right?

1179 SCENARIO: Calmly describing a social media comment they left, then checking the thread, then seeing they completely misread the situation and look like an idiot, spiraling into public comment shame

==================================================

[casual]

So, um, you know that whole thing with the— the city council meeting about the, uh, the new bike lanes? I saw this post about it earlier and, um, I left what I thought was like a really, uh, a really thoughtful comment. Just, you know, supporting local businesses and how they need, um, they need adequate parking for customers to— to survive, right?

[matter-of-fact]

I was, uh, I was pretty proud of it actually. Like I— I really laid out the, um, the economic argument, you know? How small businesses are already struggling and, uh, removing parking spaces would just— it would hurt them more.

[slight concern]

But let me just, um— let me just check real quick to see if anyone, uh, if anyone responded... [pause] Oh. Oh wait. Hang on a second here.

[growing worry]

The post is about— it's about adding bike lanes, but they're not— they're not removing parking? They're, um, they're removing a traffic lane to— to make room for the bikes. So I just— [nervous laugh] I just went on this whole rant about parking when—

[mortified]

Oh my god. Oh my god, there's like— there's twelve replies to my comment and they're all just— [groan] they're all pointing out that I, um, I completely misunderstood the entire— the entire proposal! I look like a total— like I didn't even, uh, I didn't even read the thing!

[spiraling]

And now everyone thinks I'm just some anti-bike, pro-car person who can't be bothered to— to actually understand the issue before shooting my mouth off! [frustrated laugh] This is exactly why I shouldn't— why I shouldn't comment on anything ever! I'm never— I'm never living this down!
