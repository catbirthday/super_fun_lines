Character 1: You took their side.

1271 Character 2: I didn't—that's not what happened. I didn't take anyone's side, I just said I could see where they were coming from, which—honestly, is that really such a crime?

Character 1: I needed you to back me up.

1272 Character 2: And I get that, I do, but you're asking me to like, blindly agree with you even when—look, you know I care about you, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna pretend you were totally right when you weren't.

Character 1: So I was wrong.

1273 Character 2: That's not—[frustrated laugh] see, this is what you do. You twist everything. I'm saying there were valid points on both sides, which is literally just being objective.

Character 1: Objective. Right.

1274 Character 2: Yeah, objective. I mean—what, you wanted me to just jump in and be like "yeah, they're totally wrong, you're totally right" when that wasn't even true? That's not who I am and you know it.

Character 1: I thought you'd have my back.

1275 Character 2: I do have your back! But having your back doesn't mean—okay okay, it doesn't mean I have to agree with every single thing you say or do. [Sigh] That's not friendship, that's just... I dunno, enabling or whatever.

Character 1: You embarrassed me in front of everyone.

1276 Character 2: How? By saying "I can see both perspectives"? Come on, that's barely—that's nothing. You're acting like I threw you under the bus when all I did was try to be fair.

Character 1: Fair to everyone but me.

1277 Character 2: That's—god, that's so unfair. You know what? I'm kinda getting frustrated here because you're making me out to be this terrible friend when I've literally been there for you through everything else.

Character 1: Everything else doesn't matter right now.

1278 Character 2: Doesn't matter? Are you—[scoff] wow. Okay. So all those times I did support you, even when you were dead wrong, just... poof, gone?

Character 1: This was different. This was important.

1279 Character 2: And I'm sorry it felt like I let you down, I am, but—look look, you gotta understand, I can't just turn off my brain and pretend I don't see both sides of something. That's not fair to ask of me.

Character 1: I didn't ask you to turn off your brain.

1280 Character 2: No, but you're asking me to pick sides when it's not even—when there shouldn't have to be sides between friends. I mean, can't I just... exist in the middle sometimes without it being this huge betrayal?

Script: 6f70c7f4_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So that design blog posted about the kitchen.

1281 Character 2: Wait wait wait—THE design blog? The one you're like, obsessed with? Oh my god, are you—are you serious right now?

Character 1: Yeah. Yesterday.

1282 Character 2: I'm literally—okay I need to see this immediately. Like right now. Is it—wait, did they say nice things? They better have said nice things because honestly that kitchen is [Gasp] gorgeous.

Character 1: They called it "refreshingly unpretentious."

1283 Character 2: Unpre—okay that's actually kinda perfect for you though, right? I mean, you hate all that like, showy stuff. Remember when we went to that open house and you were basically horrified by the gold fixtures?

Character 1: That was a lot of gold.

1284 Character 2: But seriously though, this is—this is huge! Like, people are gonna be pinning your kitchen all over Pinterest now. You're basically famous. How do you even feel about that?

Character 1: Weird. My sink is on the internet.

1285 Character 2: Your sink is— [Laugh] okay only you would focus on that part. But like, aren't you even a little bit excited? You worked so hard on that whole renovation.

Character 1: Six months of dust. For unpretentious.

1286 Character 2: No no no, stop being all—you know what you're doing. You're deflecting. This is amazing and you know it's amazing and I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

Character 1: The contractor saw it. Texted me this morning.

1287 Character 2: Oh god, what did he—wait, let me guess. Something about how he knew it was special all along? Those guys always do that after the fact, like they weren't the ones suggesting beige everything.

Character 1: He wants to use it in his portfolio now.

1288 Character 2: Of course he does! [Groan] That's so—ugh, typical. But whatever, you know? Let him. You're the one with the vision. Did they mention the backsplash? Because that backsplash is honestly art.

Character 1: First paragraph. Called it "unexpected."

1289 Character 2: Unexpected! See? That's—that's what I've been saying! You have like, this whole aesthetic that's just... you. I mean, I could never pull that off but on you it's perfect, y'know?

Character 1: Mom wants to show her book club.

1290 Character 2: Oh my god your mom—wait, she must be like, losing her mind right now. This is the best thing that's happened to her since you graduated. She's gonna print it out, isn't she? Frame it probably.

Script: 79bf7394_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So you think Jake's "not good enough" for me.

1291 Character 2: That's not—I never said those exact words. I just said maybe you should, y'know, think about whether he's really gonna be there for you long-term. That's all.

Character 1: Right. Just looking out for me.

1292 Character 2: Yeah, actually, I am. Because last time you dated someone who was "figuring things out" you got hurt, remember? And I'm the one who had to—[sigh]—whatever, forget it.

Character 1: This isn't last time.

1293 Character 2: Okay okay, but come on, he literally just quit his third job this year. I'm not being judgmental, I'm being realistic. There's a difference.

Character 1: Is there?

1294 Character 2: Um, yeah? Look, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I'm some kind of—like I'm attacking him personally. I don't even know the guy that well. I'm just worried about you.

Character 1: You called him a loser. To my face.

1295 Character 2: I said he seemed like he was—okay fine, that was harsh. [frustrated laugh] But honestly? Someone who lives with their parents at thirty and has no plan isn't exactly—I mean, I'm allowed to have an opinion.

Character 1: Not when I didn't ask for it.

1296 Character 2: So what, I'm supposed to just watch you make the same mistakes and say nothing? That's what friends do now? Just nod and smile while you—while you settle for less than you deserve?

Character 1: That's not your call to make.

1297 Character 2: I know that. I do. But I've been your friend for eight years and I—look look, I'm not trying to run your life here. I just thought maybe you'd wanna hear the truth from someone who cares about you.

Character 1: Your truth. Not mine.

1298 Character 2: Okay, that's—[scoff] that's real profound. But y'know what? When this goes south, and you need someone to talk to at 2 AM, you're gonna call me. Like you always do.

Character 1: Maybe I won't this time.

1299 Character 2: Seriously? You're gonna—that's where we're at now? Because I said what literally everyone else is thinking but won't say? I mean, even your sister thinks—

Character 1: Don't.

1300 Character 2: Fine. Fine fine. I'm sorry I'm not being supportive enough or whatever. But I'm not gonna pretend I think this is a good idea just to make you feel better. That's not—I dunno, that's not who we are.

Script: 46021380_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You believed them. Without even asking me.

1301 Character 2: Oh god, I—okay, I know how it looks but I didn't mean to take sides! They just told me what happened and I—I guess I just assumed... which was wrong, totally wrong.

Character 1: You guess?

1302 Character 2: No no no, that came out wrong. I mean, I definitely—I should've talked to you first. Obviously. I just, they seemed so upset and I got caught up in the moment, y'know? But that's not—[groan] that's not an excuse.

Character 1: Three years of friendship. And you just believed whatever they said.

1303 Character 2: I know, I know. God, when you put it like that... I really messed up, didn't I? Like, majorly. I wasn't thinking about—I wasn't thinking at all, honestly. I just reacted.

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

1304 Character 2: Can I just—can I explain? Not to make excuses but just... they called me crying and I'd never seen them like that before and I kinda panicked? And then before I knew it I was—I was comforting them and agreeing with them and [nervous laugh] I didn't even stop to think wait, what's the other side of this story?

Character 1: So you automatically assumed I was the bad guy.

1305 Character 2: No! Well—okay, maybe for like a second but that's because I didn't have context! If I'd known your side, if I'd just called you first like I should've... ugh, I'm literally the worst friend ever.

Character 1: At least we agree on something.

1306 Character 2: I deserve that. I do. But please, just—let me fix this? I wanna hear your version now. The real version. I promise I'll actually listen this time instead of just... jumping to conclusions like an idiot.

Character 1: Why should I bother? You've already made up your mind.

1307 Character 2: That's not—I haven't though! I really haven't. After I had time to think about it, I realized how out of character it would be for you to do what they said you did. And then I felt like such garbage because [sigh] I shoulda known that right away, y'know?

Character 1: But you didn't.

1308 Character 2: No. I didn't. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna regret that for a really long time. But I'm here now, right? Trying to make it right? That's gotta count for something... doesn't it?

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe.

1309 Character 2: Look, I—I get it if you need time. Or if you can't trust me the same way anymore. I just... I miss my best friend and I hate that I hurt you. I hate it so much.

Character 1: I needed you to have my back. That's all I needed.

1310 Character 2: I know. And I failed you. Completely. But if you give me another chance—and I totally understand if you won't—but if you do, I swear I will never, ever make that mistake again. Your back, always. No matter what.

1311 SCENARIO: debating whether to try a new route or stick to the usual

==================================================

[contemplative]

Okay, so, um, I've got like fifteen minutes before I need to be there, and I'm just— I'm standing here like an idiot trying to decide if I should, uh, if I should take the usual way or try that, um, that new route I saw on the map thing.

[slightly uncertain]

I mean, the regular way takes what, like twelve minutes? Maybe thirteen if there's, uh, if there's that backup at the light. But this new way could be— I don't know, it could be faster? Or it could be, um, it could be a total disaster and I'll end up lost and late and—

[muttering]

Right, okay, but how hard can it be? It's just, like, straight down Miller instead of taking the, uh, the usual left on Oak. That's not— that's not rocket science. I mean, I've lived here for how long now?

[conflicted]

But what if there's construction? What if it's one of those streets that looks fine on the map but is actually, like, a nightmare in real life with no parking and— [sigh] God, why am I overthinking this?

[resigned but curious]

You know what? Screw it. I've got time. Let's, um, let's see what Miller Street is all about. Worst case scenario, I'll know for next time, right?

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 880b9e8b | Role: Character 1 (A)

1312 Character 1: [choking back tears] She saved us all, Maya. [Shaky breath] Every single one of us owes our freedom to her sacrifice. [whispering] I can still hear her voice telling us to run while she held them off.

Character 2: [bitter] And we ran. [louder] We left her there to die alone! [voice cracking] These flowers, these prayers—they're nothing compared to what she deserved. She needed backup, not mourners.

1313 Character 1: [defensively] You think I don't know that? [Sob] You think I don't replay it every night? [quieter] But she gave the order. Following her command was the last way we could honor her wishes.

Character 2: [hollow tone] Honor. [Scoff] Such a clean word for such a dirty choice. [trembling] My hands haven't stopped shaking since that day. Sometimes I wonder if surviving was the real punishment.

1314 Character 1: [fierce whisper] Don't you dare dishonor her memory with that talk. [steadier] She believed in this cause more than anything. [voice breaking] The resistance lives because she died—that was always her plan, even if we couldn't see it.

Character 2: [exhausted] I'm so tired of being brave. [Shuddering breath] Every mission without her feels wrong, like fighting with a missing limb. [softer] She knew exactly what to say when things got dark.

1315 Character 1: [nostalgic tone] Remember how she'd make us laugh before raids? [Chuckle] That terrible impression of the general she'd do. [more serious] God, I'd give anything to hear that stupid voice one more time.

Character 2: [sudden anger] The general's still breathing while she's six feet under! [Growl] Where's the justice in that? [defeated whisper] Sometimes I think about going rogue, finishing what she started myself.

1316 Character 1: [urgently] She'd haunt you forever if you threw your life away like that. [gentler] We finish this together, the way she taught us. [firmly] United we stand—that was her first lesson, remember?

Character 2: [quivering] The new recruits don't even know her name. [more shakily] They call her "the martyr" like she's just another symbol. [Bitter laugh] She hated symbols. She just wanted us to be free.

1317 Character 1: [determined] Then we make them remember her name. [rising volume] Elena Rodriguez wasn't just a martyr—she was a fighter, a friend, a sister. [passionate whisper] Every victory we win, we scream her name.

Character 2: [hoarse] My throat's already raw from screaming. [Sob] But you're right. [stronger] If they want a symbol, we'll give them a legend. Her story dies when we stop telling it.

1318 Character 1: [trembling whisper] I brought her favorite chocolate. [nervous laugh] Stupid, right? [voice cracking] But I thought maybe... maybe wherever she is, she'd know we remembered the little things too, not just the heroic stuff.

Character 2: [warmly] That's not stupid at all. [Sniffle] I brought sheet music—that song she always hummed. [quieter] Maybe the wind will carry it to her. Maybe she's finally getting that rest she never took.

1319 Character 1: [broken] Why did it have to be her? [more desperately] There were twenty of us that day. [Gasping breath] Twenty chances for someone else to be the hero. But no, Elena always had to be first.

Character 2: [philosophical tone] Because that's who she was. [slowly] First to fight, first to protect, first to fall. [with reverence] Some people are just built to be shields for others. She wore that burden like armor.

1320 Character 1: [angrily] Armor with too many holes in it, apparently. [Grunt] The medics said she took seventeen bullets. [horrified whisper] Seventeen. How does someone even stay standing that long?

Character 2: [in awe] Love. [certain] Pure, stubborn love for every soul she was protecting. [voice breaking] That's the only force strong enough. She turned herself into a wall of flesh and fury for us.

1321 Character 1: [resigned] The sunrise looks different without her. [Sigh] Colors seem muted, like the world knows it lost something irreplaceable. [softly] But we keep watching them, because she can't anymore.

Character 2: [with finality] Then we'd better make these sunrises count. [Deep breath] Every dawn is a gift she bought with blood. [fierce whisper] I swear on this grave, Elena—we won't waste a single one.

Character 1: [flatly] Hi, I'm calling about my MindfulMe app, account ID MM-7842-X9. [sighs heavily] I just... I noticed you updated your privacy policy again, and [trailing off] I don't know if I even care anymore, but what changed?

1322 Customer Support: [warmly] Thank you for reaching out about your account, MM-7842-X9. [reassuringly] I understand privacy updates can feel overwhelming. The main changes involve data sharing with our new wellness partners at 2847 Harmony Boulevard—would you like me to explain the specifics?

Character 1: [monotone] Sure, whatever. [long exhale] I've been using this app for like, what, three months? [more quietly] Nothing's really helping anyway, so maybe my data doesn't even matter.

1323 Customer Support: I hear that you're feeling discouraged, and that's completely valid. Regarding your data, we now share anonymized usage patterns with research code RX-92B only. But first—have you been able to access our new crisis support feature at all?

Character 1: [dismissively] Crisis support, meditation tracks, mood journals... [groans] I've tried them all since October 23rd. [flatly] So you're selling my sad little check-ins to researchers now, is that it?

1324 Customer Support: We never sell personal data—that's against our core policy 14.2A. The research partnership only uses aggregated, completely anonymous patterns. Your individual entries, especially from your journal feature, remain encrypted with key protocol AES-256.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh good, my 3 AM anxiety spirals are safe behind some... some fancy numbers. [sighs] Look, can I just—can I opt out of everything? [defeated] Delete account number MM-7842-X9 entirely?

1325 Customer Support: You absolutely have that option under section 8.4 of our terms. [pause] Before you decide though, I see you've built quite a streak—47 days. [encouragingly] Would you consider maybe just pausing sharing instead of full deletion?

Character 1: [bitterly] Forty-seven days of what exactly? [quieter] Pressing buttons, rating my mood from one to ten every morning at 7:15? [sighs deeply] Fine, how do I pause this sharing thing without losing everything?

1326 Customer Support: I can help you with that right now—it's under Settings, then Privacy Control tab PC-3. You'll see toggle switch PS-001 for research sharing. And hey, those 47 days of showing up? That actually means something, even when it doesn't feel like it.

Script: 54567cea | Role: Customer Support

1327 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Valley Medical Labs, this is Sarah speaking. How can I help you today—do you have a patient ID number ready?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, it's 4-7-2-9-6, and I've been waiting for my blood work for two weeks now. [sighs heavily] My doctor said it would be three days, maybe five at most.

1328 Customer Support: Let me just... pull that up for you right away. Oh, I see there's been a delay with your lipid panel—looks like the sample needed to be re-run.

Character 1: [incredulous] Re-run? Nobody called me about this! [getting louder] I've been checking my patient portal every single day, refreshing it like... like I'm waiting for concert tickets or something.

1329 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, and you're absolutely right—someone should have contacted you. The system shows a notification was sent, but, um, sometimes those get caught in spam filters.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, so my health results are sitting in spam next to Nigerian prince emails. [groans] When exactly will I get these results then?

1330 Customer Support: The good news is the re-test was completed yesterday morning. Your results should be uploaded within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, definitely by Thursday at the latest.

Character 1: [skeptically] Should be? Or will be? [pause] [more urgently] Because I have a follow-up appointment Friday, and if I don't have these numbers, the whole visit is basically pointless.

1331 Customer Support: I'm putting a priority flag on your file right now—actually, let me... [briskly] I'm sending a direct message to the lab supervisor to expedite this for your Friday appointment.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well, that's... that's something at least. [sighs] Can you guarantee I'll have them by Thursday evening, though?

1332 Customer Support: While I can't make absolute promises, the priority flag means your results jump to the front of the queue. In my experience, these usually process within twelve hours once flagged.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll... I'll wait another day. [more firmly] But if they're not there by Thursday noon, I'm calling back and asking for you specifically, Sarah.

1333 Customer Support: Please do ask for me—I'll be here nine to five. [quickly] I'm also adding my direct extension to your file notes, it's 2-2-4.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh, that's actually really helpful. [pause] [more appreciatively] Sorry for getting snippy earlier, I'm just stressed about these cholesterol numbers, you know?

1334 Customer Support: No apologies needed—waiting for health results is incredibly stressful. We see it every day, and honestly, two weeks is unacceptable for a standard panel.

Character 1: [curiously] Does this happen often? The whole re-running thing? [more concerned] Because now I'm wondering if the results will even be accurate.

1335 Customer Support: It's actually quite rare, maybe one in two hundred samples. Usually it's due to temperature issues during transport or, occasionally, insufficient sample volume—but the re-test results are completely reliable.

Character 1: [relieved] Okay, that's... that makes me feel a bit better. [chuckles nervously] I was imagining them just losing my blood somewhere in a giant warehouse of tubes.

1336 Customer Support: I promise we're much more organized than that! Is there anything else I can help with while I have your file open—update contact information, anything like that?

Character 1: [decisively] No, I think we're good. [more hopefully] I'll just keep refreshing that portal and, um, hopefully see those results pop up soon—fingers crossed for tomorrow.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1337 [Nervous] I know everyone thinks it's ridiculous, but like, elevators are basically death traps waiting to—to just drop, you know? [Fast] What if the cable snaps?

1338 [Whisper] Dogs can sense fear, right? [Tsk] So every time I see one, even a tiny one, I'm convinced it knows I'm terrified.

1339 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, flying is "statistically safe," but statistics don't help when you're thirty thousand feet up in a metal tube. [Groan]

1340 [Sad] My friends don't invite me to beach trips anymore because I just—I can't do the ocean thing. [Sigh] Too much water, too many unknowns underneath.

1341 [Angry] It's not funny, okay? [Shout] Balloons literally make me break out in a sweat—the popping, the static, everything about them!

1342 [Happy] You wanna know something hilarious? [Laugh] I'm a grown adult who still runs up the basement stairs because of the dark!

1343 [Slow] The thing about spiders is, um, they move in this really unpredictable way that just... [Whisper] I dunno, it makes my skin crawl.

1344 [Disappointed] I tried therapy for the needle thing, but honestly? [Tsk] Still can't even watch medical shows without covering my eyes.

1345 [Fast] Okay so basically my whole family thinks I'm being dramatic but thunder is LOUD and sudden and—and you never know when it's coming! [Groan]

1346 [Sarcastic] "Just face your fears," they said. [Chuckle] Yeah, let me just casually approach that clown at my nephew's birthday party—that'll go well.

1347 [Sad] I haven't been to the dentist in, uh, three years? [Slow] The drill sound alone makes me literally nauseous just thinking about it.

1348 [Angry] People act like I choose to be scared of heights—trust me, I'd love to enjoy rooftop bars like everyone else! [Sigh]

1349 [Whisper] Sometimes I'll be driving and imagine the bridge just, like, collapsing? [Fast] And then I grip the wheel so tight my knuckles go white.

1350 [Happy] My boyfriend bought me a bird—a BIRD—for my birthday without knowing about my whole wing-flapping phobia thing. [Laugh] [Sarcastic] That was a fun surprise.

1351 [Disappointed] I wanted to be a chef, y'know? [Tsk] But I can't even look at raw chicken without getting all panicky about germs and contamination.

1352 [Slow] Moths are just... they're so erratic and dusty and they always—always—fly straight at your face. [Shout] Why do they DO that?!

1353 [Fast] I mean, everyone gets a little nervous public speaking, right? [Nervous] But I literally threw up before my wedding toast—my own wedding!

1354 [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm totally fine with bees—if by "fine" you mean I once abandoned my car in a parking lot because one flew in. [Chuckle]

1355 [Sad] The worst part about being scared of crowds is that, um, you basically can't do anything fun anymore—no concerts, no festivals... [Sigh] Nothing.

1356 [Angry] My therapist keeps saying "mice are more afraid of you," but like—that doesn't help when one runs across my kitchen! [Fast] [Groan] I stood on a chair for an hour!

==================================================

[casual] [conversational]

So I've been doing this whole new skincare thing, right? Found this amazing routine on Reddit where you're supposed to wash your face with, like, straight lemon juice and baking soda. I know it sounds weird, but the post had like three thousand upvotes and everyone was raving about how it cleared up their skin overnight.

[matter-of-fact]

I've been doing it for two weeks now and honestly, my face has been feeling a little... tight? But the internet said that's normal, you know, it means it's working. Getting all the toxins out or whatever.

[slight concern]

Actually, wait, let me just double-check something real quick. [pause] I'm looking up "lemon juice baking soda face wash" and... huh. That's weird. The first result is saying— oh. Oh no.

[growing alarm]

It says here that lemon juice is super acidic and baking soda is super basic and mixing them can literally— [sharp exhale] —can literally burn your skin? Like, chemical burn your face off?

[panic building]

What do you mean "severe irritation and scarring"? [nervous laugh] I've been doing this for two weeks! My face isn't tight because it's working, it's tight because I'm— [groan] —because I'm slowly dissolving my skin!

[spiraling] [frantic]

Oh my god, I'm gonna be scarred forever! I trusted Reddit with my face! With my FACE! [whimper] Why would three thousand people upvote skin destruction? What is wrong with the internet? What is wrong with me?!

[slightly puzzled]

Wait, let me just— okay, this one's $4.99 and this one's... $4.97? Two cents? Really? That's, um, that's what we're dealing with here? I mean, it's two cents, but like, two cents is two cents, right?

[rambling]

But maybe the cheaper one is, uh, is older stock or something? Like, maybe it's been sitting here longer and that's why— no, that doesn't— that doesn't make sense. It's detergent, not, um, not produce.

[deadpan]

Oh wait. [laugh] Oh my god. One of them has a coupon thing stuck to it. A little, uh, a little yellow sticker that says "Save 50 cents!" So it's actually more expensive. Cool.

[resigned]

You know what? I'm just gonna grab this one and, um, and call it a day. My clothes will be clean either way, and I've already spent way too much brain power on— on laundry soap. [exhale] Priorities, right?

Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, fifteen minutes? Twenty? I feel like it's been— it's been forever, but it's probably, uh, probably only been like five minutes or something. [sigh] Why does the spin cycle take so— why does it take so long?

[slightly impatient]

I mean, it's just spinning, right? It's not like it's, um, it's not like it's doing anything complicated. Just, uh, just spin the water out and we're done. But no, it has to do this whole— this whole dramatic buildup thing where it goes slow, then fast, then it stops, then it— [groan] come on.

[conversational]

I could be doing other stuff right now. I could be, um, I could be folding the stuff from yesterday that's still sitting in the, uh, in the basket. But instead I'm just standing here like— like some kind of laundry sentinel or whatever.

[resigned, slightly amused]

Although, I mean, if I walk away now it's gonna finish the second I leave. That's just— that's just how these things work, right? Murphy's law of laundry or something. [laugh] Okay, okay, I'll just wait another— oh, there it goes. Finally.

Wait, hang on— hang on a second. Something feels, um, something feels weird about this shirt. Like, the seam is— why is the seam on the, uh, on the outside? That's not— that's not right.

[slightly embarrassed]

Oh my god. Oh my god, it's inside out, isn't it? I've been walking around with my shirt inside out like some kind of, um, like some kind of person who doesn't know how shirts work. [groan] How long have I— how long have I been like this?

Okay, so I got dressed this morning, and I was, uh, I was rushing because I was running late, and I just grabbed the first— the first clean shirt I could find. But did anyone notice? Please tell me no one noticed.

Maybe it didn't go through? Sometimes texts just, um, they just don't— no, wait, it shows delivered. It says delivered right there. So they got it, they just, uh, they just haven't responded yet.

Or maybe I said something weird? Let me just— let me read it again. "Hey, are we still on for tonight?" That's, that's normal, right? That's not— I'm not being clingy or anything, I'm just, um, I'm just confirming plans.

God, I hate this part. The, uh, the waiting part. Like, just respond with literally anything. Even just "yeah" would be— would be totally fine.

But it's not— it's not in my bag, obviously, because that would be, um, that would be too easy. [tsk] I can just picture it sitting there on my, uh, on my kitchen counter, looking all smug and— and unused.

[slightly impatient]

I mean, they say a watched pot never boils, but that's— that's not actually true, right? It's just, uh, it's just that time moves differently when you're standing here staring at— at nothing. [tsk] Maybe I should do something else while I wait?

But then what if I, um, what if I forget about it and it boils over? That happened last week with the— the pasta water, and it was such a mess. So maybe I should just— just stay here and, uh, and babysit this thing.

Are those bubbles? No, no that's just— that's just the bottom of the pot. False alarm. [hmm] God, this is like watching paint dry, except I actually need this water to, um, to cooperate with me here.

Let me just— [sigh] okay, so the date says... March fifteenth. And today is, uh, today is the eighteenth. So that's, what, three days? That's not— that's not that bad, right? I mean, it's yogurt, it's supposed to be, like, fermented or whatever.

[slightly skeptical]

But it looks a little, um— is that supposed to be watery on top? That's probably just, uh, just the whey separating, that's normal. I think that's normal. [hmm] Smells fine. Smells like, you know, like yogurt.

[rationalizing]

I mean, people eat expired stuff all the time and they're— they're totally fine. My grandmother used to say those dates are just, um, just suggestions anyway. And I'm not gonna waste four dollars of organic yogurt because of three little days.

I mean, it's not— it's not that weird, right? People forget to text back all the time. It happens. I'm just gonna, um, I'm just gonna respond now and maybe add like a little "sorry for the late reply" thing?

[trailing off, uncertain]

Although that might make it worse because then I'm, like, calling attention to how late it is, which maybe she hadn't even... ugh, I don't know.

Okay, so, um, I just need to— I just need to get these stupid things untangled and then I can, uh, I can actually listen to something. How do they even— how do they even get this twisted up? I literally just, like, threw them in my bag yesterday and now they're— [sigh] now they're like some kind of, um, some kind of puzzle.

[slightly impatient]

Alright, so if I pull this part here, and then— no, wait, that's making it worse. That's definitely making it worse. Okay, um, let me just— let me just start over. There's gotta be, like, a system to this, right? Like, there's gotta be some kind of, uh, some kind of method.

[focused, talking slower]

So this loop goes through— no, wait, that's not a loop, that's just— [tsk] okay, that's just more tangled cord. Um, maybe if I work backwards from the, uh, from the plug thing? The jack? Whatever you call it.

[brightening]

Oh wait, I think I see— yeah, if I just pull this bit through here and then— [hmm] actually, you know what, maybe I should just— maybe I should just buy wireless ones like a normal person.

I should probably just, um, just sit here and wait, right? But I was gonna— I was gonna make that sandwich, and I need to, uh, to text Sarah back about tomorrow, and— [tsk] why didn't I think of this earlier?

[slightly whiny]

Maybe if I'm really, really careful I could just— no, no no no, that's how you get, um, that's how you get those little dent marks in the polish. I've done that before and it's so— it's so annoying.

[frustrated]

So Jake totally bailed on me today for our movie plans. Like, we've had this planned for two weeks, and he just texts me this morning like "can't make it, sorry" with literally no explanation.

[annoyed]

I'm just— I'm so tired of people doing this, you know? Like I already bought the tickets, I turned down other stuff, and now I'm just sitting here with nothing to do on a Saturday.

And it's not even like he gave me a real reason, it's just "something came up" which is like, what does that even mean?

[irritated] [hurt]

I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting but it just feels like— like he doesn't value our friendship or whatever. Like my time doesn't matter.

I was actually really looking forward to this too, we were gonna see that new horror movie and get dinner after, and now I'm just—

[surprised]

Oh wait, he's calling me. That's weird, he never calls. Um, hold on a sec... [pause]

Wait, what? You're— you're outside my apartment right now?

[confused] [dawning realization]

Oh my God. Oh my— he's here with like a whole group of people for my birthday. Which is next week but I guess— [laugh] 

I completely forgot I mentioned wanting a surprise party like months ago.

[guilty] [happy]

I feel like such an idiot. He was trying to get me to stay home without being obvious about it.

So I had this little whitehead on my chin yesterday, you know? Just sitting there being all obvious. And I was like, whatever, I'll just give it a gentle squeeze before my shower.

[light] [chuckle]

It was so satisfying too! Like, it just popped right out, clean as anything. I felt like I'd won the skincare lottery or something. [satisfied sigh] You know that feeling, right?

[conversational]

I thought I was being so responsible about it too. Used clean hands, didn't go crazy with it. Just a little— you know, just enough to get it out.

[slight concern]

But now I'm looking at it this morning and it's like... [pause] it's definitely redder than it was yesterday. Like, noticeably red.

[growing worried]

Actually, wait. [sharp inhale] Oh no. Is that— is that a yellow ring around it? That's not... that doesn't look normal.

Oh my god, I think it's infected. Like, actually infected! It's hot to the touch and everything's all puffy around it! [panicked] What if it scars? What if I gave myself some horrible skin thing?

So of course it starts pouring the second I get to campus, and I'm just standing there under this tiny little overhang with like fifteen other people, all of us just staring at the sky like idiots. And I'm supposed to meet Professor Chen in twenty minutes but I can't even make it across the quad without getting completely soaked.

[exasperated]

I'm literally watching people with umbrellas just walking by all casual, and I'm like—ugh, that could be me right now if I wasn't such a— if I just remembered to grab the stupid thing from by the door where I literally keep it for this exact reason.

[trailing off] [confused]

Wait, is it... is it stopping? Like the rain is just—

[surprised] [relieved]

Oh wow, it actually stopped. Like completely stopped. The sun's even coming out a little bit.

==================================================

[casual]

So I was at the, um, coffee place this morning, and this guy next to me is, uh, he's telling his friend about how, like, you shouldn't eat carbs after 6 PM because your, um, your metabolism just shuts down completely. And I'm like— I mean, I couldn't help myself, you know?

[matter-of-fact]

So I, uh, I turn around and I'm like, "Actually, that's not really how metabolism works." Because it's not, right? Like, your body doesn't just— it doesn't have a, um, a timer or whatever. I was being helpful, you know what I mean?

[a bit pleased with self]

The guy seemed, um, grateful actually. He was like, "Oh, really?" and I explained the whole— the whole thing about how it's really just, uh, calories in versus calories out, and timing doesn't— it doesn't really matter that much.

[starting to doubt]

But now I'm thinking about it and, um... wait. [pause] Hang on, doesn't your metabolism actually, like, slow down at night? I mean, uh, I think I remember reading something about circadian rhythms and—

[growing uncertainty]

Oh god. Oh no, no, no. [nervous laugh] I think— I think there actually is something about, um, about not eating late because your body processes food differently when you're, uh, when you're getting ready to sleep?

[mortified]

I totally— [groan] I completely corrected this guy with the wrong information! He probably went home and told people that some, um, some know-it-all at the coffee shop said metabolism myths aren't real, and now I'm— [frustrated laugh] I'm the idiot spreading misinformation!

[spiraling with shame]

What if he posts about it? What if he's like, "This person confidently told me I was wrong and they were completely— they were completely wrong!" [whimper] I can't— I can't show my face at that coffee place ever again. I'm never, um, I'm never correcting anyone about anything ever again!

[annoyed]

And I'm already running late for work, so I'm like frantically clicking refresh, clicking back, trying again. Nothing. Just that, that loading screen mocking me.

The whole page is frozen and I'm like, are you kidding me right now?

[irritated]

So then I try a different browser, thinking maybe it's Chrome or whatever. Same thing! Just sits there loading forever.

I'm like, this is 2024, how is your website this broken? It's a bank! [scoff] Like you'd think they'd have their stuff together.

[light]

Actually, it's funny because I remember when she first told me she was thinking about applying. This was like, what, two months ago? She was so nervous about it, kept saying how she didn't think she had enough experience.

[a bit concerned]

Wait, did she— [pause] did she tell you about the promotion yet? Because I feel like she mentioned it was supposed to be announced this week, but I can't remember if she said it was public or...

[more worried]

Oh no. Oh no, wait. [nervous laugh] She specifically said not to tell anyone until after the official announcement. I remember now, she was like, "Don't say anything yet," and I was like, "Of course, of course."

[panicking]

[sharp exhale] And I just— I just told you! What if you see her before she tells you? What if she asks if I said anything? [groaning] Oh my god, I'm the worst secret keeper in the world!

Oh man, so you know how I've been swamped with those quarterly reports? Well, I found this amazing shortcut today. [light laugh] Instead of doing all the individual calculations, I just copied last quarter's format and updated the main numbers. Saved me like three hours.

[conversational]

I mean, the data's basically the same, right? Just different dates and totals. Nobody's gonna notice, and I actually got to leave at a reasonable time for once. [satisfied sigh] Felt pretty clever, honestly.

[slight hesitation]

Although... now that I'm thinking about it, I probably should've double-checked some of those subcategories. But the big picture stuff was right, so— [pause] Wait, what if someone actually looks at the details?

[growing concern]

Oh god, what if they compare it to the raw data? I didn't— I didn't actually verify that the breakdowns matched. [nervous laugh] I just assumed they'd be similar enough.

Oh no. Oh no, no, no. The presentation is tomorrow morning. With the whole executive team. And if they ask about any specific metrics, I'm— [sharp exhale] I have no idea what's actually in there.

Wait, is that— is it supposed to look that angry? Like, the whole area is kind of raised now and it wasn't before. [sharp exhale] God, why do I always do this?

Actually, let me just check real quick while I'm thinking about it. [pause] Okay, so that's the one I saw, but— wait. There's another one here for thirty-seven dollars. "Premium Web Solutions." What the hell is that?

Hold on, let me scroll down more. Oh no. Oh no, there's— [sharp exhale] there's like six charges here I don't recognize. Forty-two dollars, eighteen dollars, seventy-three dollars. What is happening right now?

But then I'm— I'm pulling into my driveway and I suddenly remember that, uh, that Jake and Sarah were in the car with me. Like, the whole time.

==================================================

[casual]

So, uh, I had this little, um, this little incident this morning with my water bottle. I was, like, rushing around getting ready and I just— I knocked it right over on the kitchen counter. Water everywhere, you know? But I was like, um, okay, no big deal, just— just grab some paper towels and, uh, and clean it up.

[matter-of-fact]

I mean, I thought I got it all. I was pretty, um, pretty thorough about it, you know? Wiped down the counter, the, uh, the floor, even got under the, um, the coffee maker a little bit. Felt all responsible and stuff. Like, look at me being an adult, cleaning up my— my messes immediately.

[slight concern]

But then, like, just now I was walking through the kitchen and I— I stepped on this wet spot. And I'm like, um, wait, that's weird, because I thought I— I thought I got everything this morning, you know? So I'm, like, feeling around with my foot and it's— it's definitely wet.

[growing unease]

So I, uh, I move the coffee maker to check and— oh god. Oh no. The water, it— it went under there and it's been sitting there for, um, for like eight hours now. Just— just soaking into the, uh, the wood underneath.

[anxious] [rambling]

And now I'm like, um, is this— is this how water damage starts? Like, do I need to— should I be calling someone? Because I don't— I don't know how long wood can, uh, can sit in water before it just— [nervous laugh] before it starts rotting or warping or— oh god, what if it's already— what if I just, um, what if I just destroyed my kitchen with a stupid water bottle?
