Character 1: So I got the blue check yesterday.

365 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you got verified? Like, actually verified? Oh my god, that's—that's huge! I mean, I knew it was gonna happen eventually but like... how do you feel about it?

Character 1: Weird. People are treating me differently already.

366 Character 2: Oh no, like—are they being weird about it? Because honestly, you're still the same person, y'know? The checkmark doesn't change anything about who you actually are.

Character 1: My follower count jumped by three thousand overnight.

367 Character 2: Three thou—[Gasp] okay that's actually kinda terrifying? Like, where do all these people even come from? It's like they just... materialize out of nowhere when they see that little blue thing.

Character 1: And now everyone expects me to post more. Be more "professional."

368 Character 2: Ugh, no no no—that's literally the worst part about it. Like suddenly you're supposed to be this, this perfect content machine or whatever? That's not—that's not why you started posting in the first place, right?

Character 1: My mom called. She saw it somehow.

369 Character 2: Your mom? [Laugh] Oh god, what did she—actually, I can totally picture her being like, super proud but also completely confused about what it means.

Character 1: She asked if I'm famous now. I said no. She didn't believe me.

370 Character 2: I mean... technically? You're kinda—okay not famous famous, but like, verified is definitely something, y'know? It's recognition for all the stuff you've been doing.

Character 1: My DMs are a nightmare.

371 Character 2: Oh god, I bet—wait, are people like, pitching you stuff already? Because that happens so fast, it's honestly ridiculous how people just assume you wanna promote their random whatever now.

Character 1: Mostly people asking how I did it. Like there's a formula.

372 Character 2: Right? As if you didn't just, like—as if you haven't been consistently creating amazing content for literally years. They want the shortcut that doesn't exist, basically.

Character 1: I might turn it off.

373 Character 2: You can—wait, you can turn it off? I didn't even know that was a thing. But honestly? [Sigh] If it's making you uncomfortable, then yeah, maybe take a break from it.

Character 1: It feels like I sold out. And I didn't even get paid.

374 Character 2: Okay, hey—no. You didn't sell out, you got recognized for being good at what you do. That's—that's completely different. But I get it, I really do. The pressure must be... yeah.

Script: e199a5b4_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I won something.

375 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you won something? Like, what kind of something? Because you never—I mean, you literally never enter contests, so this is kinda huge.

Character 1: That streetwear brand I follow. They picked me.

376 Character 2: Shut UP. Shut up right now. The one you're always—oh my god, the one with the drops you stay up for? [Gasp] That's actually insane!

Character 1: Yeah. Full collection. Everything from the new line.

377 Character 2: Okay okay okay, I need you to understand that this is like—this is literally your dream, right? How are you so calm right now? I'd be, I dunno, screaming?

Character 1: It doesn't feel real yet.

378 Character 2: No no, I totally get that. It's like—when good things happen, sometimes your brain just... doesn't compute? But babe, this is real. You actually won!

Character 1: They want me to do an unboxing video.

379 Character 2: Oh—oh that's... hmm. Are you gonna? Because I know you're not really the whole social media thing, but like, it could be fun? Maybe?

Character 1: I don't do videos. That's not me.

380 Character 2: Yeah, no, totally fair. You shouldn't have to—I mean, they picked you, right? Not some influencer. [Chuckle] Maybe just tell them thanks but no thanks?

Character 1: Already did. They said it's fine.

381 Character 2: See? That's—that's actually really cool of them. So when does all this stuff arrive? Because honestly, I'm dying to see everything. Like, dying.

Character 1: Thursday. There's a jacket worth two grand.

382 Character 2: Two GRAND? For a—okay, you know what? You deserve this. After all those L's on the app, all those sold-out drops... karma finally showed up.

Character 1: My mom thinks I should sell it.

383 Character 2: Oh god, of course she does. [Groan] But like—no, this is YOUR thing, you know? You've wanted this stuff forever, so just... enjoy it?

Character 1: Yeah. I'm keeping it all.

384 Character 2: Good! Good good good. That's—honestly? That's the right call. This is like, your moment. Own it, babe. When Thursday comes, I wanna see everything, okay?

Script: e4385d20_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told Alex. About me.

385 Character 2: I—okay, yeah, I did, but hear me out. They were literally talking about how nobody ever shows interest in them and I thought—I dunno, I thought I was helping you both out.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

386 Character 2: Look look, I get that you're mad, but you've been crushing on them for like six months without doing anything about it. [frustrated laugh] Someone had to make a move here.

Character 1: Someone. But not you.

387 Character 2: Fine, not me, but—come on, you know you never would've said anything. You're acting like I ruined your life when honestly? Alex was actually really happy about it.

Character 1: That's not the point.

388 Character 2: Then what is the point? Because I'm—I'm trying to understand why you're this upset when it literally worked out. They wanna talk to you now, isn't that what you wanted?

Character 1: I wanted to do it myself. When I was ready.

389 Character 2: When you were ready? You mean never? Because that's—that's what it was gonna be and we both know it. [sigh] I'm sorry I didn't ask first, okay? But I'm not sorry for trying to help.

Character 1: You weren't helping. You were interfering.

390 Character 2: Oh, interfering. Right. Like when you told Jake I liked him sophomore year? But I guess that was different somehow, huh?

Character 1: You asked me to tell him.

391 Character 2: I—no, I said I wished he knew, which is basically what you've been saying about Alex for months! You're being such a hypocrite right now, seriously.

Character 1: I never asked you to get involved.

392 Character 2: You didn't have to! That's what friends do—they help each other out even when—especially when you're too scared to help yourself. But fine fine, next time I'll just watch you pine forever.

Character 1: There won't be a next time.

393 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So that's—you're really gonna throw away our entire friendship over this? When Alex literally wants to go out with you now? [scoff] That makes total sense.

Character 1: You broke my trust.

394 Character 2: And I'm—look, I'm sorry about that part, I am. But you're not even giving me a chance to—whatever. When you're done being dramatic and realize I actually did you a favor, you know where to find me.

Script: 7ac61b83_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Got into the Barcelona program.

395 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what?! Oh my god, are you serious? The one you were like, super stressed about? The architecture one?

Character 1: Yeah. Full scholarship too.

396 Character 2: I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is everything you wanted, right? When do you— [Gasp] when do you leave?

Character 1: September. For a year.

397 Character 2: A whole year... wow. That's—I mean, obviously I'm gonna miss you like crazy, but this is... you gotta be freaking out right now, yeah?

Character 1: I don't know if I should go.

398 Character 2: Hold on, what? You're not—are you actually thinking about turning this down? Because that's... I mean, help me understand here.

Character 1: It's far. Really far.

399 Character 2: Okay okay, yeah, it's—it's definitely far. But like, isn't that kinda the point? You've been talking about getting out of here since, what, sophomore year? [Soft laugh] Remember?

Character 1: That was different. That was just talk.

400 Character 2: No no no, that wasn't just—you literally made a Pinterest board called "Barcelona Dreams" with like, a thousand pics of Gaudí buildings. Don't even try to pretend.

Character 1: My mom cried when I told her.

401 Character 2: Oh... oh babe. That's—ugh, that's really hard. Was it like, sad crying or proud crying or... both? Probably both, right?

Character 1: Both. Mostly sad, I think.

402 Character 2: Yeah, that's... I mean, of course she's gonna be sad. But honestly? [Sigh] She'd probably be more sad if you stayed just for her, y'know?

Character 1: Would you go? If it were you?

403 Character 2: Um, in a heartbeat? Like—okay wait, that's not fair because I'm not you and I don't have your family situation, but... yeah. Yeah, I'd go.

Character 1: I already paid the deposit.

404 Character 2: You—wait, you already paid?! So you're just like, torturing yourself for fun? Oh my god, you're actually going! You're gonna— [Laugh] you're really gonna do this!

Script: ed87c681_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You compared me to Jamie again.

405 Character 2: I wasn't—okay, I mentioned Jamie, but it wasn't like a comparison comparison. I was just trying to point out that, y'know, it's possible to get through this stuff.

Character 1: "If Jamie can do it, so can you." Direct quote.

406 Character 2: That's not—[sigh] okay okay, maybe I said that, but I meant it as encouragement. Like, you're just as capable as anyone else, that's all I was trying to say.

Character 1: I'm not Jamie.

407 Character 2: I know that! Obviously I know that. But you're acting like I'm some terrible friend when I'm literally just trying to help you see that you can do this. You've been so down on yourself lately and I—I dunno what else to do.

Character 1: Maybe don't bring up how everyone else is doing better.

408 Character 2: That's—that's not what I'm doing though. You're twisting it into something negative when honestly, I'm just trying to motivate you. [frustrated laugh] Like, sorry for believing in you, I guess?

Character 1: That's not believing in me. That's you being disappointed I'm not them.

409 Character 2: Whoa, no no no, that's completely unfair. I'm not disappointed in you—I mean, maybe I'm frustrated that you can't see how great you are, but that's different. You're putting words in my mouth.

Character 1: "Sarah got promoted already." "Mike finished his degree." You say these things constantly.

410 Character 2: Because—look, because I thought it might help to see that it's not impossible, y'know? Not because I think you're less than them. But fine, apparently everything I say is wrong.

Character 1: It hurts.

411 Character 2: Okay, I—[sigh] I hear that, and I'm sorry it hurts, but also like... you gotta understand I'm coming from a good place here. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I'm trying to help.

Character 1: By making me feel worse.

412 Character 2: That's not—ugh, come on. You know that's not the intention. And honestly? Sometimes it feels like you just wanna stay stuck and get mad at anyone who tries to push you forward.

Character 1: So now I'm the problem.

413 Character 2: No, I didn't—see, this is what you do. I try to explain myself and suddenly I'm the bad guy. Look look, we both kinda suck at this conversation right now, okay?

Character 1: Stop comparing me to other people. That's all I'm asking.

414 Character 2: Fine. Fine, I'll stop. But I still think you're—whatever. [quieter] I just wanted you to see what you're capable of, but I'll find another way, I guess.

415 SCENARIO: waiting for the dryer to finish

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, twenty minutes? Thirty? I feel like it's been— it's been forever, but it's probably, uh, probably not even close to done yet.

[slightly impatient]

These things always take, what, like an hour? Maybe more? I should've, um, I should've checked the timer when I started it, but I was just— I was in a rush to get it going and now I'm just, uh, just standing here like an idiot.

[conversational]

I mean, I could go do something else, right? Like, I don't have to just— just hover around the laundry room like some kind of, um, some kind of dryer stalker. [laugh] That's weird. That's a weird thing to say.

[second-guessing]

But what if it's almost done and I miss it? Then my clothes are just gonna sit there getting all wrinkled and— and I hate ironing. I really, really hate ironing.

[listening intently]

Wait, is it— is it slowing down? It sounds different. Or maybe I'm just, uh, maybe I'm just imagining things because I want it to be done.

[resigned]

You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm gonna go make some coffee and check back in like fifteen minutes. Yeah. That's, um, that's the adult thing to do here.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: da0c3139 | Role: Character 1 (A)

416 Character 1: [sharp tone] Excuse me, but your daughter's bag is blocking Mackenzie's makeup station. [getting louder] We've been here since five-thirty this morning to claim this spot, [clipped words] and I'd appreciate some respect for our preparation space.

Character 2: [relaxed drawl] Oh, sorry about that. [soft chuckle] Lily just tosses her stuff wherever—you know how kids are. [slower] I'll move it in a sec, just need to finish this coffee first.

417 Character 1: [incredulous] A second? [rapidly accelerating] The competition starts in forty minutes and we still need to do final hair touches, [hissing whisper] rhinestone check, and warm-up! [shrill] Every second counts at this level of competition!

Character 2: [amused tone] Wow, that's intense. [yawning] We just threw Lily's costume in the car this morning. [lazily] She'll probably do her own makeup in the bathroom—takes her like five minutes, [trailing off] maybe ten.

418 Character 1: [horrified gasp] Her OWN makeup? [voice climbing higher] Do you have any idea how the stage lights wash out their faces? [frantically] Mackenzie's been getting professional stage makeup since she was four years old!

Character 2: [genuinely curious] Professional makeup for a four-year-old? [slight laugh] That's wild. [more thoughtfully] Lily started dance last year because her friend was doing it. [warmly] She just likes spinning around to the music, honestly.

419 Character 1: [condescending] Just likes spinning? [faster and sharper] This is a competitive environment, not some recreational Tuesday class! [lowering voice] These judges are looking for precision, [building intensity] dedication, and complete commitment from dancer AND parent!

Character 2: [unbothered] Yeah, the judges seem pretty serious. [chuckling softly] I brought a book to read during awards—these things take forever, right? [casually] Oh, did you want me to move that bag now?

420 Character 1: [exasperated shriek] A BOOK? [trembling with rage] While your daughter is being scored on her life's work? [quieter but venomous] Some of us actually care about supporting our children's futures in this industry!

Character 2: [defensive but calm] Hey now, I support Lily. [more firmly] I drove her here, paid the fees, and I'll clap when she's done. [gentler] That's plenty of support for an eight-year-old's hobby.

421 Character 1: [bitter laugh] Hobby? [accusingly] Do you know how much I've invested in Mackenzie's training? [rapid-fire delivery] Private lessons, custom costumes, travel competitions—[voice breaking] we've sacrificed everything for her dreams, absolutely everything!

Character 2: [sympathetic] That sounds really expensive. [awkwardly] We just do the one class a week—sixty bucks a month. [brighter tone] Leaves plenty of money for our family vacations, [contentedly] which Lily likes way better anyway.

422 Character 1: [snapping] Vacations? [incredulous whisper] During competition season? [building to shout] We haven't taken a non-dance trip in three years because REAL dance families understand priorities! [seething] Your lackadaisical attitude is exactly what's wrong here!

Character 2: [slightly annoyed] Okay, that's a bit much. [steady voice] My kid's happy, healthy, and having fun—isn't that what matters? [more pointedly] Not everyone needs to treat children's activities like the Olympics, [sighing] you know.

423 Character 1: [fake sweet voice] Oh, how nice for you. [dripping sarcasm] When Mackenzie gets her scholarship to Juilliard, [louder and prouder] I'm sure "having fun" will look great on Lily's community college application! [sharp laugh]

Character 2: [irritated now] Community college? [incredulous laugh] She's eight! [more forcefully] She wants to be a marine biologist, not a dancer. [muttering] This is just something fun to do on Saturdays, [exhale] good grief.

424 Character 1: [panicking] Marine biologist? [rushed words] But what about her stage presence, her natural turnout? [desperately] You're wasting her potential! [pleading] At least get her into the competitive team—think about her future!

Character 2: [firmly] Her future is fine. [measured tone] She's a kid who likes dance class and sea turtles. [chuckling] I'm gonna go move that bag now, [cheerfully] before you have an actual heart attack about it.

425 Character 1: [calling after her] This conversation isn't over! [muttering quickly] Some parents just don't understand dedication, sacrifice, or what it takes. [getting quieter] Mackenzie, sweetie, stay away from that girl—[whispered] her mother's attitude might be contagious.

Character 2: [calling back casually] Good luck to Mackenzie today! [humming] Lily's doing the dinosaur dance, so watch out—[laughing warmly] she's got some serious T-Rex arms in her routine. [fading out] Should be hilarious!

Script: 9ce5d9cf | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Hi, yes, I need to, um, talk about my policy—it's TRV-8847-X2M, I think? [frustrated] I'm going to Mexico, or wait, was it Jamaica? [sighs] My flight is tomorrow at 2:47 PM and I don't understand if volcanic eruptions are covered.

426 Customer Support: Good afternoon, let me pull up your policy number TRV-8847-X2M. I can definitely help clarify your coverage today. Could you please confirm your destination and departure date for me?

Character 1: [rambling] It's definitely Jamaica—no, Mexico, the Riviera Maya at 2215 Beachfront Avenue. [anxiously] But what if there's a tsunami? [louder] My neighbor said her cousin got stuck because of jellyfish attacks and insurance didn't pay anything!

427 Customer Support: I understand your concerns, sir. Natural disasters including tsunamis are covered under section 4.2 of your comprehensive plan. [more clearly] However, marine life encounters fall under medical emergencies, which requires documentation from local authorities.

Character 1: [agitated] Section 4.2? But my confirmation email says H-7-B-9-K! [muttering] Or was that my wifi password? [desperately] Listen, what if the hotel burns down while I'm scuba diving and my passport is inside?

428 Customer Support: Sir, that H-7-B-9-K is your booking reference, not the policy section. Fire damage and document loss are both covered—you'd receive up to $1,500 for passport replacement. [more firmly] May I have your date of birth to verify your account?

Character 1: [suspicious] Why do you need that? [quickly] It's March 32nd—wait no, February 14th, 1968. [groans] Actually 1986! [accusingly] Are you going to deny my claim because Mercury is in retrograde?

429 Customer Support: February 14th, 1986, thank you. Astrological events aren't claim factors, sir. Your coverage remains valid regardless of planetary positions, as stated in your terms and conditions document.

Character 1: [panicking] But what about my medication? I take 17 pills—no, 7 pills at 8:15 AM! [breathlessly] The pharmacy gave me extras but they're expired in 2025. [whispering] Will customs arrest me if insurance doesn't pre-approve?

430 Customer Support: Pre-existing medication coverage extends to 90 days supply when traveling. You'll need form MED-45A signed by your doctor. Customs won't arrest you, but keep medications in original containers with your prescription labels.

Character 1: [excited] Form MED-45A! Yes! [confused again] Wait, my doctor retired and moved to Vermont—or was it New Hampshire? [urgently] Can his ghost sign it? [softer] Sorry, I mean his replacement, Dr. Rodriguez at 445 Medical Plaza.

431 Customer Support: Dr. Rodriguez can absolutely sign the form as your current physician. I can email it to you right now. What's the best email address to reach you?

Character 1: [rapidly] It's jumpingbean1986 at—no wait, that's my old one! [frustrated] Use travelguy_mexico at something dot net. [sighs heavily] Actually, just send it to my wife at karen.p.anderson at gmail, she handles everything.

432 Customer Support: I'll send form MED-45A to karen.p.anderson at gmail dot com. The email will arrive within 5 minutes from noreply at travelguard dot com. Is there anything else about your coverage you need clarified?

Character 1: [suddenly worried] What if I lose my left shoe specifically? [intensely] Not both shoes, just the left one! [rambling] It happened to me in Denver in 2019 at gate B-42, and it was my lucky shoe!

433 Customer Support: [professionally] Personal belongings including footwear are covered up to $2,500 total under section 7.1. Individual items are subject to a $500 maximum per item. [more sympathetically] You would need to file a police report for the claim.

Character 1: [skeptically] Police report for a shoe? [chuckles nervously] What if aliens take it? [more seriously] Actually, what's your name and employee ID? [demanding] I need to write everything down on my napkin here!

434 Customer Support: My name is Sarah, employee ID S-4489-TX. I've made detailed notes in your file about today's call. You'll also receive a summary email with all the information we discussed at karen.p.anderson at gmail.

Character 1: [relieved] Sarah S-4489-TX, perfect! [suddenly remembering] Oh wait, do hurricanes count if they're named after my ex-wife Patricia? [laughs nervously] Because that seems like it should be double coverage, right?

435 Customer Support: Hurricane coverage applies regardless of the storm's name, sir. You're fully protected under our natural disaster clause. Have a wonderful trip to Mexico, and remember our 24-hour hotline is 1-800-TRAVEL-9 if you need us!

Script: 6394a602 | Role: Customer Support

436 Customer Support: Good afternoon, MediQuick Pharmacy, this is Rachel speaking. [quickly] How can I assist you with your prescription needs today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I've been trying to refill my blood pressure medication for—[sighs heavily]—three days now. Your website keeps saying [slowly] "processing error" and I'm about to run out.

437 Customer Support: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that issue. Let me pull up your account right away—can I have your name and date of birth please?

Character 1: [irritated] It's Michael Chen, April 15th, 1978. [groans] Look, I really need this sorted because my doctor said I can't, um, I can't skip doses.

438 Customer Support: Absolutely, Mr. Chen, I understand the urgency. I see your prescription here and—oh—it looks like there's a flag on your insurance verification.

Character 1: [exasperated] Insurance? But nothing's changed! [louder] I have the same plan, same employer, same everything since, what, 2019?

439 Customer Support: I believe you completely, sometimes the system just needs a manual override. Let me try processing this through our, uh, our backup verification system—should take just a moment.

Character 1: [sarcastically] A moment? That's what the automated message said yesterday. [sighs] Can you at least give me enough pills to last the weekend?

440 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I wish I could, but legally we need the insurance cleared first. Wait—actually—I'm seeing it's going through now! That was faster than expected.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank God. [cautiously] So when can I pick it up? And please don't say "24 to 48 hours" because that's not—

441 Customer Support: No no, much better news! Since you're marked as urgent, we can have it ready in two hours, or we offer same-day delivery for free given the inconvenience.

Character 1: [pleasantly surprised] Free delivery? [chuckles] Well that's—yeah, that would be perfect actually. [more relaxed] I work from home anyway.

442 Customer Support: Excellent choice! [quickly] I'm scheduling delivery between 4 and 6 PM today—does that work? We'll text you when the driver's en route.

Character 1: [gratefully] Yes, that's perfect. [sighs with relief] You know, Rachel, you've been way more helpful than the three other people I talked to this week.

443 Customer Support: [warmly] That's so kind of you to say, Mr. Chen. [more seriously] I'm adding a note to your file about the website issues—our tech team really needs to fix that.

Character 1: [curiously] While I have you, can I set up auto-refill? [frustrated again] Because honestly, going through this every month is just—it's exhausting.

444 Customer Support: Absolutely, yes! [briskly] I can activate that right now—it'll automatically process seven days before you run out and text you for confirmation.

Character 1: [satisfied] Perfect. And the delivery option stays the same? [hopefully] Because that's actually way more convenient than driving to you guys.

445 Customer Support: Yes, all your preferences save to your profile. Auto-refill, delivery, even your preferred delivery window—everything's set for next month.

Character 1: [appreciatively] You've turned my whole day around, Rachel. [chuckles softly] Started ready to cancel everything, and now I'm actually—[more lightly] well, happy with you guys again.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

446 [Fast] Oh hey, yeah, I was just, um, standing here looking at this—this wall is really interesting actually. [Nervous laugh] [Laugh]

447 [Happy] Everything's totally fine! [Fast] Why would you even ask that? I mean, I'm just—I'm great, honestly.

448 [Slow] So... [Sigh] how long have you been, uh, standing there exactly?

449 [Whisper] Did someone just—no, never mind, I thought I heard something but it's probably nothing. [Fast] It's nothing.

450 My hands? [Laugh] They're not shaking, that's just—I had too much coffee earlier, you know how it is.

451 [Angry] I'm not being weird! [Fast] You're the one who's being—actually, forget it, let's just move on, okay?

452 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because I always sweat this much in perfectly normal situations. [Tsk]

453 [Slow] I should probably, um, I should probably go... check on that thing I was supposed to check on.

454 [Disappointed] Great, now everyone's looking at me and I can't even—[Sigh] I dunno what to do with my face.

455 What? [Fast] [Laugh] No, I wasn't humming nervously, that was just a—a regular hum, totally intentional.

456 [Shout] I said I'm FINE! [Fast] [Whisper] Sorry, I didn't mean to yell, I just—my voice does that sometimes.

457 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? I literally forgot why I came in here in the first place.

458 [Sad] This is going terribly, isn't it? [Slow] I mean, I'm trying so hard to just be normal but—[Groan]

459 [Happy] [Fast] Wow, would you look at the time! I should really get going before—before it gets later than it already is!

460 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Yeah, because casually dropping my phone three times in two minutes is exactly how I planned this to go.

461 Um, quick question—[Fast] is it obvious that I'm basically dying inside right now or am I hiding it well? [Chuckle]

462 [Disappointed] I practiced this whole thing in my head and now I can't remember a single—[Tsk] [Sigh] never mind.

463 [Whisper] [Slow] If I just keep smiling and nodding, maybe no one will notice that I'm kinda freaking out here.

464 [Angry] [Fast] Stop looking at me like that—you're making it worse! I was doing fine until you started with the—the staring!

465 [Laugh] So apparently my fight-or-flight response chose a third option: just stand here and say increasingly weird things until everyone leaves.

466 SCENARIO: Mad about an overcharge on their bill, then while ranting realizes they forgot about a subscription they signed up for

==================================================

[frustrated]

Dude, I am so pissed right now. I just got my credit card statement and there's this random forty-seven dollar charge that I have no idea what it's for, like— like literally no clue.

[angry]

So I call the bank and they're like "oh it's from some media company" but they can't tell me which one, and I'm like how is that helpful? [scoff] Forty-seven dollars just disappeared and nobody can explain it.

[ranting]

I'm going through every single transaction trying to figure out what the hell this is, and the customer service guy is just like "well you must have signed up for something" and I'm like no, no I would remember spending fifty bucks on— on whatever this is.

[slowing down] [uncertain]

Wait, hold on. Media company... forty-seven dollars... [pause] Oh god, is that— did I sign up for that documentary streaming thing?

[realization dawning]

Oh my god. [groan] I totally did. Like three months ago when I wanted to watch that true crime series and they had the free trial and I was like "oh I'll just cancel it after."

[embarrassed] [slightly sheepish]

And then I... completely forgot about it. [nervous laugh] So I've been paying for this thing for months and never even— god, I feel like such an idiot. That poor customer service guy.
