Character 1: Got my first tomato today.

534 Character 2: Oh my god, wait wait wait—you actually did it? Like, you grew an actual tomato? From your garden? That's—I'm so proud of you right now, seriously.

Character 1: It's just one tomato.

535 Character 2: No no no, don't do that! Don't minimize this! Do you know how many people kill their plants? Like, literally everyone I know has murdered at least three houseplants, and you just—you grew food! [Laugh] That's incredible!

Character 1: Three houseplants seems low.

536 Character 2: Okay, fine, maybe it's more like... seven? Eight? But that's not—wait, how big is it? The tomato? Is it like a proper one or one of those tiny cherry things?

Character 1: Baseball sized. Pretty decent.

537 Character 2: Baseball sized?! Are you—that's huge! Oh my god, what else is growing out there? Please tell me you have more stuff coming in because I'm gonna need, like, weekly updates now.

Character 1: Some peppers. Lettuce. The zucchini took over half the yard.

538 Character 2: The zucchini did what? [Gasp] Wait, I've heard about this—they're like, basically garden invaders, right? My mom always said never plant more than one unless you wanna feed the whole neighborhood.

Character 1: Should've mentioned that earlier.

539 Character 2: But like, honestly? That's kinda amazing though. You went from—remember when you said you couldn't keep anything alive? And now you're basically drowning in vegetables. That's character development, babe.

Character 1: It's mostly the zucchini drowning everything else.

540 Character 2: Okay but still—you're gonna eat that tomato, right? Like, you have to. It's your first one! Maybe make a little caprese or—oh! Oh oh oh, just slice it with some salt. [Sigh] Nothing beats a garden tomato with just salt.

Character 1: Already ate it. Pretty good.

541 Character 2: You already—of course you did. Was it like, different from store bought? Because everyone always says that but I'm never sure if they're just being pretentious or if it's actually—

Character 1: Way better. Actually tasted like something.

542 Character 2: See? See, this is what I'm talking about! You're out here growing real food while the rest of us are eating those weird waxy things from the supermarket. When can I come raid—I mean, visit your garden?

Character 1: Tuesday. Bring bags.

543 Character 2: Bags? Oh my god, you're actually gonna share? Wait—this is about the zucchini invasion, isn't it? [Laugh] I'm basically gonna be your vegetable disposal service. I'm weirdly okay with that, honestly.

Script: ceb49ffe_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about Jamie.

544 Character 2: Oh, um, okay—what about Jamie? I mean, if this is about tonight, they were already with me when you texted, so I didn't think it'd be—

Character 1: It's every time now.

545 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not true. It's not every time. Maybe like, I dunno, the last few hangouts, but you're making it sound like I never come alone anymore.

Character 1: When was the last time it was just us?

546 Character 2: I—okay, look look, I get that it's been a while, but Jamie's been going through some stuff lately and they just... they need me around more. [Sigh] It's complicated.

Character 1: Everything's complicated when you don't want to deal with it.

547 Character 2: Wow. That's—that's really unfair. You're acting like I'm doing this to hurt you or something. I'm literally just trying to be a good partner here, y'know?

Character 1: And a terrible friend.

548 Character 2: Oh my god, seriously? A terrible friend? After everything we've—no, you know what, that's bullshit. I'm not gonna just abandon Jamie when they're struggling with anxiety just because you're mad about it.

Character 1: So their anxiety matters more than our friendship.

549 Character 2: That's not what I—[frustrated laugh] you're twisting my words. Both things can matter, okay? It doesn't have to be this like, competition or whatever you're making it into.

Character 1: Except you already chose.

550 Character 2: I didn't choose anything! I'm trying to balance—look, Jamie gets really insecure when I go out without them, and yeah, maybe I've been bringing them along more, but I'm not trying to exclude you or—

Character 1: You're just doing it anyway.

551 Character 2: Okay okay, fine, I hear you. But honestly? You could try being a little more understanding here. Like, have you even tried getting to know Jamie better? You barely talk to them.

Character 1: Hard to have a conversation when you two are attached at the hip.

552 Character 2: We're not—[scoff] god, you sound jealous. Is that what this is? Because I'm finally in a relationship and you're—I dunno, feeling left out or something?

Character 1: I'm done with this.

553 Character 2: Wait wait wait—don't just walk away. Look, I'm sorry if I've been... I mean, I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. But you gotta understand, I can't just leave Jamie alone right now. Can we at least figure something out?

Script: e417c369_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I won that cooking thing yesterday.

554 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? The cooking—oh my god, the competition at the fairgrounds? You actually—you won? Like, won won?

Character 1: Yeah. First place.

555 Character 2: I'm sorry, I'm just—[Gasp] holy crap! That's incredible! What did you make? Was it the, um, the thing with the duck you were practicing?

Character 1: Braised short ribs. Changed it last minute.

556 Character 2: You changed—okay that's so brave though, like seriously. I would've been way too scared to just... switch it up like that, y'know?

Character 1: The duck wasn't working. Too dry every time.

557 Character 2: But still, that's—I mean, that takes guts. How many people were there? Was it like, super intimidating with everyone watching and stuff?

Character 1: About two hundred people. Twelve chefs competing.

558 Character 2: Two hundred—[Laugh] oh my god, I would've literally died. Like my hands would be shaking so bad I'd probably drop everything. Weren't you nervous at all?

Character 1: My knife slipped twice. Nobody noticed.

559 Character 2: See, that's—that's what I mean though! You just kept going? Like nothing happened? That's so... professional, honestly.

Character 1: Had to keep plating. No time to panic.

560 Character 2: Okay but like—what happens now? Is there prize money or, um, do you get to compete somewhere bigger? This is huge!

Character 1: Five thousand dollars. And some knife set.

561 Character 2: Five thou—are you kidding me right now? That's like, that's actual money! What're you gonna do with it? [Chuckle] Please tell me you're gonna celebrate at least?

Character 1: Might fix my car. Or save it.

562 Character 2: No no no, you gotta—I mean, obviously it's your money but like... you just won a whole cooking competition! That's not nothing, y'know?

Character 1: It was fine. Lucky the judges liked meat.

563 Character 2: Lucky? Babe, no—that's not luck, that's literally talent. You're gonna, you're gonna downplay this whole thing, aren't you? Classic.

Script: 824169c2_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: This is the fourth time this month.

564 Character 2: I know, I know how it looks—but I swear this time was different. My car literally wouldn't start, and I tried to—I mean, I called you but my phone died right when—okay that sounds fake, but it's true.

Character 1: There's always something.

565 Character 2: That's not—okay, I get why you'd think that. But like, I'm not making these up, y'know? The dentist thing was real, my tooth was killing me, and the work emergency—my boss literally threatened to fire me if I didn't stay.

Character 1: Right.

566 Character 2: No no no, don't do that. Don't just—[nervous laugh] I mean, I know I've been flaky lately. I do. But it's not on purpose, I swear. Everything just keeps happening at once and I—I dunno how to make you believe me.

Character 1: Maybe because it's every single time.

567 Character 2: It's not every—okay, fine, it's been a lot. You're right. God, you're totally right and I'm just—I'm really sorry. I didn't realize how many times I'd cancelled until you just said that.

Character 1: Do you even want to hang out anymore?

568 Character 2: What? Of course I do! That's—wait, is that what you think? That I'm like, avoiding you or something? Because that's not—I would never. You're literally one of my favorite people. [Sigh] I've just been really bad at... showing up.

Character 1: Yeah. You have.

569 Character 2: I'm gonna—I wanna fix this. Like, genuinely. No more excuses, even if they're real, I just—I'll figure it out, y'know? Cancel other stuff if I have to. You matter more than—you just matter, okay?

Character 1: I've heard that before too.

570 Character 2: I know. Shit, I know I've said that and then—then something comes up and I bail again. But this time I mean—actually, no, I meant it before too, I just... [Groan] I'm really bad at prioritizing, aren't I?

Character 1: Incredibly bad.

571 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I am. And you've been so patient with me and I just keep—keep letting you down. That's not the kind of friend I wanna be. It's not who I thought I was, but apparently...

Character 1: Look, I just need to know if this is going to change.

572 Character 2: It is. It has to, because I can't—I can't lose you over this. That sounds dramatic but like, you're really important to me and if I keep screwing this up, I'm gonna—just, please give me one more chance? Actually, wait, don't answer that yet.

Character 1: Why not?

573 Character 2: Because I wanna—tomorrow, lunch, that place you like downtown. I'll be there at noon. Early, actually. 11:45. And if I'm not there, you can just—you can be done with me. But I'll be there. I promise I'll be there.

Script: b592b9d6_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. The candle thing is actually making money now.

574 Character 2: Wait wait wait—hold up. The candles? Your little Etsy shop is like... it's actually profitable? Oh my god, that's—that's huge!

Character 1: Yeah. Last month covered all my supplies. Plus three hundred extra.

575 Character 2: Three hundred—okay no, you can't just drop that on me like it's nothing! [Laugh] I mean, do you realize how insane that is? Most side hustles literally never make money, like ever.

Character 1: It's not that big a deal.

576 Character 2: Um, excuse me? It's a massive deal! You've been grinding on this for what—like a year? And now you're actually in the black? That's... honestly that's kinda inspiring.

Character 1: Fourteen months. But who's counting.

577 Character 2: You are, apparently! [Chuckle] No but seriously—how do you feel? Like, are you gonna expand or... I dunno, what's the plan?

Character 1: Haven't thought about it.

578 Character 2: Oh come on, you've definitely thought about it. You're like—you're the most overthinking person I know. In a good way! But still.

Character 1: Fine. Maybe I've considered wholesale. A little.

579 Character 2: Wholesale? That's—okay yeah, that tracks actually. Local shops would totally eat those up. Remember that boutique on Third? They'd be all over your stuff, guaranteed.

Character 1: They already emailed me.

580 Character 2: Shut up—are you serious right now? They reached out to you? [Gasp] Okay okay, this is getting real. Like, really real. What did you tell them?

Character 1: Nothing yet. What if I can't keep up with orders?

581 Character 2: Oh no no no, don't do that thing where you—where you talk yourself out of something good. You're literally already profitable! That's the hard part!

Character 1: Is it though?

582 Character 2: Yes! God, yes. Most people never even—I mean, you know how many failed Etsy shops are out there? Thousands. Probably millions, honestly. But yours actually worked.

Character 1: Lucky timing, I guess.

583 Character 2: Timing my ass—sorry, but no. [Sigh] You worked for this. Like, really worked. Just... let yourself be proud for once, y'know? Please?

584 SCENARIO: trying to figure out what that weird noise in their car is

==================================================

[muttering to self]

Okay, so, um, what is that— what is that noise? It's like a, uh, like a clicking? Or maybe more of a, um, a ticking? I don't know, but it's definitely— it's definitely not normal.

[slightly concerned]

It started when I, uh, when I turned left back there, I think? Or was it— no wait, maybe it was when I hit that pothole. [sigh] God, there are so many potholes on this street, it could've been any of them.

[thinking out loud]

Okay, so if it's the, um, the wheels, then it's probably— what do they call it— CV joint? Is that a thing? I feel like my dad mentioned that once, but I was, uh, I was probably not paying attention because car stuff is just—

[faster, slightly panicked]

Wait wait wait, it's not the brakes, is it? Because if it's the brakes, that's like, um, that's actually dangerous. I should— I should probably pull over if it's the brakes, right?

[calmer, resigned]

You know what, it's probably just— it's probably just something stuck in the tire. Like a rock or, um, or some debris. [exhale] I'll check it when I get home. It's fine. Everything's fine.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 662b7456 | Role: Character 1 (A)

585 Character 1: [guilty] I'm so sorry I had to cancel again. [voice breaking] The baby was up all night with a fever, and I just... [trails off weakly] I know I've been the worst friend lately, Sarah, I really do.

Character 2: [flatly] It's fine. [pause] [more bitter] I mean, it's the fourth time this month, but [forced cheerfulness] babies come first, right? I just wish you'd told me before I was already at the restaurant waiting.

586 Character 1: [defensive] You don't understand how hard it is! [voice cracking] I haven't slept more than three hours straight in weeks. [desperately] Sometimes I can't even remember if I've eaten or showered, let alone check my phone.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Right, because childless people couldn't possibly understand exhaustion. [softer] Look, I get that everything's different now. [building frustration] But you used to at least text back when I asked how you were doing.

587 Character 1: [whispered] I miss us too. [stronger] I miss wine nights and spontaneous brunches and [voice catching] actually finishing a conversation. [sigh] But she needs me constantly, and I'm drowning just trying to keep her alive and happy.

Character 2: [coldly] Maybe I should stop trying then. [quieter] Since clearly our fifteen-year friendship ranks somewhere below [mockingly] laundry and bottle sterilizing now. [bitter laugh] I'll just wait until she's eighteen, should I?

588 Character 1: [shocked] That's not fair! [pleading] You're still important to me, Sarah. [more frantically] I think about calling you while I'm nursing at 3 AM, but then I worry I've already burdened you enough with baby talk.

Character 2: [hurt] You never burden me. [louder] Or at least, you never used to worry about that before. [trembling] Now it feels like you've decided for both of us that we can't be close anymore.

589 Character 1: [crying softly] Sometimes I look at her and feel nothing. [whispered confession] Just exhaustion and resentment, and then guilt crashes over me. [sniffling] How can I tell you that when you've been trying to conceive for two years?

Character 2: [stunned quiet] Oh, Emma... [gentle now] That's exactly the kind of thing you should tell me. [warmly] I'm not just here for the Instagram-perfect moments. [soft laugh] I'm here for the messy, horrible truth too.

590 Character 1: [relieved exhale] Really? [hopefully] Because yesterday I hid in the bathroom and ate an entire sleeve of cookies while she screamed. [laughing through tears] And I felt like the world's worst mother but also oddly victorious.

Character 2: [giggling] That's the Emma I know! [enthusiastically] Look, what if I came over with takeout instead? [more gently] No pressure to be presentable or conversational. I could just exist in your chaos with you.

591 Character 1: [surprised] You'd do that? [uncertainly] The house is a disaster, I probably smell like spit-up, and [self-consciously] honestly, I might cry randomly about absolutely nothing. The hormones are still completely insane right now.

Character 2: [firmly] I'll bring wine for me, [playfully] decaf coffee for you, and enough Thai food to feed an army. [lovingly] We can sit in your disaster and you can cry about whatever you want.

592 Character 1: [gratefully] God, I've missed you so much. [steadier voice] I've been so scared of losing you that I ended up [regretfully] pushing you away anyway. [exhale] Classic Emma, right? Self-sabotaging since 1990.

Character 2: [teasingly] Well, classic Sarah is stubborn as hell, so. [more seriously] You're stuck with me through spit-up, sleepless nights, and [chuckle] even your cookie-hiding bathroom breakdowns. That's what this is, right?

593 Character 1: [emotionally] When did you become the wise one? [snorting laugh] Remember when you tried to microwave eggs in their shells? [more sincerely] But yes, that's exactly what this is. Friends through everything.

Character 2: [mock offended] We agreed never to mention the egg incident! [laughing] But seriously, Emma, [thoughtfully] we're just figuring out a new rhythm. It doesn't mean the song has to end completely, you know?

594 Character 1: [softly] Tomorrow, 2 PM? [nervously quick] Fair warning though—she might scream the entire time, I might not shower, and [building confidence] actually, you know what? Come anyway. This is real life now.

Character 2: [warmly] Tomorrow, 2 PM, absolutely. [excitedly] I'll bring earplugs, no judgment, and [pause] [emotionally] just... thank you for letting me back in. [quietly] I've really missed my best friend too.

Script: 173adad2 | Role: Character 1

Character 1: [pedantically] According to subsection 4.7B of our covenant agreement, the, uh, permissible mailbox height is explicitly delineated as 42 to 46 inches. [clears throat] Mine measures precisely 44.75 inches, yet I've received violation notice HV-2024-0892 dated November 15th.

595 Customer Support: Mr. Whitmore, I see the notice here in our system. The issue isn't the height actually—it's the, um, Byzantine mosaic pattern you've applied to the mailbox post. That violates Article 7, Section 2A regarding exterior modifications.

Character 1: [incredulous] Byzantine? It's clearly Neo-Romanesque with Visigothic influences! [huffs indignantly] Furthermore, nowhere in the 247-page bylaws document does it specifically proscribe artistic embellishments under two square feet. [smugly] I've memorized every single ordinance.

596 Customer Support: [patiently] Sir, on page 189, paragraph 3, it states "all exterior fixtures must maintain uniform neighborhood aesthetics." Your property at 4827 Willowbrook Lane has accumulated—let me check—seventeen violations since January. We need to address these systematically.

Character 1: [defensively] Those alleged infractions are all highly contestable interpretations! [speaking faster] The garden gnome violation G-4521 ignores that it's actually a reproduction of a 14th-century gargoyle, and complaint L-7733 about my grass being 3.2 inches instead of 3.0 is just pedantic.

597 Customer Support: Mr. Whitmore, the board meeting on December 3rd at 7 PM will review your case. You'll need to bring documentation, photos, and your member ID card WB-19847. [sighs heavily] The fines currently total $1,750 if not resolved.

Character 1: [condescendingly] I shall present my dissertation-length rebuttal with forty-seven footnotes and appendices A through K. [mutters] The board's interpretation of "earth tones" in Section 9.4 is laughably provincial—beige and taupe aren't the only colors found in nature, you know.

598 Customer Support: Sir, I'm also seeing complaint R-2024-445 about your wind chimes. Apparently, they're made from vintage typewriter keys? The decibel level exceeded 55dB according to Mrs. Henderson's readings at 2847 Willowbrook.

Character 1: [outraged] Those are antique Remington keys from 1923! [scoffs] Mrs. Henderson's sound meter app on her phone is hardly calibrated to ISO standards. [sarcastically] Perhaps we should discuss her violation—that ghastly pink flamingo clearly contradicts ordinance 12.6C.

599 Customer Support: I'll note your counter-complaint as CC-8924 for the board's review. Please just... bring all your documentation to Conference Room B. We'll need three copies of everything, collated and bound per protocol 2.1 in the procedures manual.

Script: a3b5253a | Role: Customer Support

600 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is First National Bank customer service, my name is Rachel. How may I assist you today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, hi, your ATM just ate my card! [louder] I was trying to withdraw cash on Fifth Street, and the machine just—[exasperated sigh]—kept it and shut down!

601 Customer Support: Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear that happened to you. Can you please provide me with your account number or the card number that was retained?

Character 1: [irritated] I don't have my account number memorized—the card with that information is stuck in your machine! [sarcastically] That's kind of the whole problem here, isn't it?

602 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir. [more reassuringly] Let me try another way—could you provide your full name and date of birth? We'll locate your account and get this sorted immediately.

Character 1: [sighs heavily] It's Michael Chen, born March fifteenth, nineteen eighty-seven. [impatiently] Look, I need that card back today—I'm flying out tomorrow morning and that's my only debit card!

603 Customer Support: Thank you, Mr. Chen, I've found your account. I see the ATM transaction attempt at 2:47 PM on Fifth Street. Now, unfortunately, we can't retrieve the physical card today, but—

Character 1: [interrupting loudly] What do you mean you can't get it today? [angrily] Can't someone just open the machine? [desperately] I literally need it for my trip!

604 Customer Support: The ATMs are serviced on a scheduled basis for security reasons, typically within 3-5 business days. [quickly] However, we can expedite a replacement card to you today—overnight shipping at no charge, given the circumstances.

Character 1: [groans] Three to five days? [sarcastically slower] That's really helpful when I'm leaving tomorrow. How exactly does overnight shipping help when I need it in twelve hours?

605 Customer Support: Actually, Mr. Chen, we have another option. Can you visit any of our branch locations before 5 PM today? We can issue a temporary card on the spot.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Oh, well... that's something, I guess. [cautiously] This temporary card—it'll work internationally, right? [more firmly] Because I'm going to Japan.

606 Customer Support: Yes, absolutely, the temporary card functions exactly like your regular card. Full international access, same PIN, same daily limits. [reassuringly] You'll be all set for Japan.

Character 1: [relieved sigh] Okay, fine, where's the nearest branch? [hurriedly] And they'll have all my information already, or do I need to bring something?

607 Customer Support: The closest branch is on Market Street, about two miles from that ATM location. I'm noting everything in your file right now, so just bring a photo ID. They'll have everything ready.

Character 1: [muttering] Two miles... great. [louder] And what about the card stuck in the machine—[curiously] do I get that back eventually, or is it destroyed?

608 Customer Support: [professionally] For security purposes, retained cards are destroyed after retrieval. But don't worry, your permanent replacement will arrive within those 3-5 business days. Should I have it sent to your home address on file?

Character 1: [tiredly] Yeah, sure, send it home. [chuckles dryly] My wife can add it to the collection of cards that have betrayed me. [more seriously] The Market Street branch, you said?

609 Customer Support: Yes, 451 Market Street, open until 5 PM today. [sympathetically] I really do apologize for this inconvenience, Mr. Chen. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Character 1: [resigned] No, that's... that's everything. [softly] Thanks for the help, Rachel. [slightly sarcastic] Here's hoping the branch visit goes more smoothly than my ATM experience.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

610 [Whisper] Okay, so nobody knows about this yet, right? [Fast] I mean, I haven't told anyone else and I'm kinda freaking out about keeping it quiet.

611 [Happy] Oh my god, they're gonna flip when they—wait, sorry, what were we talking about? [Laugh] Different topic, completely different topic!

612 [Sarcastic] No, no, I'm definitely not acting weird at all. [Tsk] This is just my normal, everyday face when nothing special is happening.

613 [Angry] I swear, if someone ruins this, I'm gonna—ugh, I've been planning for months! [Groan]

614 [Slow] You know what's funny? [Chuckle] Sometimes the hardest part isn't the actual planning, it's just... not blurting it out.

615 [Fast] Quick, quick, change the subject—they're coming over here and I absolutely cannot keep a straight face right now! [Whisper]

616 [Disappointed] I almost slipped up earlier, like, the words were literally on the tip of my tongue. [Sigh]

617 [Shout] What? No! [Fast] I mean, uh, no, there's nothing going on next weekend, why would you even ask that?

618 [Sad] It's actually kinda lonely, y'know? [Slow] Having this amazing thing you can't share with the one person who'd appreciate it most.

619 [Happy] Every time I think about their face when it happens, I just—I can't stop smiling! [Laugh] [Whisper] This is torture though, honestly.

620 [Sarcastic] Sure, let's just casually discuss calendars and availability like I'm not sitting on the biggest secret ever. [Disappointed] This is fine.

621 [Fast] Did they suspect anything when you talked to them? Because I might've been a little too obvious earlier and—[Groan] I'm terrible at this!

622 [Slow] I, um, I keep having these dreams where I accidentally tell them everything. [Tsk] [Sad] Wake up in a panic every single time.

623 [Angry] Nobody better post anything online about this—I mean it! [Fast] One tagged photo and the whole thing is basically ruined!

624 [Whisper] Should we have, like, a code word or something? [Chuckle] I feel like a really bad spy right now.

625 [Happy] The venue is booked, the stuff's ordered, everyone's confirmed—[Fast] wait, sorry, thinking out loud, forget I said anything! [Laugh]

626 [Disappointed] I thought keeping secrets would be easier as an adult, but honestly? [Sigh] It's somehow gotten worse.

627 [Shout] Don't open that closet! [Fast] [Angry] I mean—there's, uh, there's a spider in there, huge spider, very dangerous!

628 [Slow] You ever notice how when you're hiding something, literally every conversation feels like a minefield? [Sarcastic] Super relaxing way to live.

629 [Sad] Part of me wants to just tell them now and—no, no, I gotta wait. [Sigh] [Whisper] It'll be worth it, right?

630 SCENARIO: Excited about weekend plans, then finds out they might get canceled, then hears they're back on

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my god, so you know how I've been looking forward to this weekend forever? Jake finally got tickets to that outdoor concert series, and we're gonna do the whole thing— like picnic blankets, wine, the whole— it's gonna be so perfect.

[enthusiastic] 

And Sarah and Tom are coming too, so it'll be like this whole group thing, and the weather's supposed to be amazing. I already bought like the cutest sundress for it, and I've been like, mentally planning this whole Instagram-worthy setup. [laugh] I know that's dumb but—

[deflated]

But then this morning Jake texts me and he's like "weather might be bad, they might cancel" and I'm just like... ugh, seriously? I've been looking forward to this for weeks. Like I literally turned down three other things this weekend because of this.

[disappointed] [sighing]
