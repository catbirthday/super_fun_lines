Character 1: Got my green card today.

263 Character 2: Wait, WHAT? Oh my god—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like, it actually came through? This is—[Gasp] I'm literally gonna cry, this is huge!

Character 1: Yeah. Ten years.

264 Character 2: Ten years. Ten. Holy—okay, okay, we need to like, we gotta celebrate or something. How are you so calm about this? I'd be, I dunno, screaming from the rooftops or whatever.

Character 1: Don't really know how to feel yet.

265 Character 2: No no no, that's—that's totally fair actually. It's probably like... overwhelming, right? After waiting for so long and dealing with all that bureaucratic nightmare stuff?

Character 1: The lawyer fees alone could've bought a house.

266 Character 2: Ugh, don't even—the system is so messed up, honestly. But hey, you did it. You actually [Chuckle] you actually did it. Can you like, travel now? See your family?

Character 1: First thing I'm doing. Already looking at flights.

267 Character 2: Oh man, your mom's gonna—she's gonna lose it, right? How long has it been since you've seen them? Like three years?

Character 1: Four.

268 Character 2: Four years. Jesus. That's—I can't even imagine, y'know? Not being able to just... go home when you want to.

Character 1: Missed two funerals. My cousin's wedding. Everything.

269 Character 2: [Sigh] Babe, that's... god, I'm so sorry. That must've been—I mean, being stuck here while life just kept happening over there? That's brutal.

Character 1: It's done now.

270 Character 2: Yeah but like—it's okay to be angry about it, you know? Or sad or... whatever you're feeling. This whole thing, it's been like, basically your entire twenties, right?

Character 1: Pretty much. Started the process at twenty-three.

271 Character 2: And now you're—wait wait, you're thirty-three now? So literally a decade of just... waiting? Of not knowing if you could stay or had to leave?

Character 1: Something like that. Want to get dinner? I'm buying.

272 Character 2: Um, yes? Obviously yes! But also—hold on, we're not done talking about this. This is like, this is literally life-changing stuff and you're just... [Laugh] okay fine, we can talk over food. But I'm getting champagne. Non-negotiable.

Script: 26e3047d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I got into the program.

273 Character 2: Wait wait wait—the one you applied to? The super competitive one with like, I dunno, five spots or whatever? Oh my god, are you serious right now?

Character 1: Yeah. Found out this morning.

274 Character 2: I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is actually [Gasp] insane. How are you so calm about this? I'd be bouncing off the walls!

Character 1: Haven't really processed it yet.

275 Character 2: No no no, I get it, I totally get it. It's like—when something this big happens, your brain just kinda... freezes up, right? But holy shit, you actually did it.

Character 1: Lots of people applied. I got lucky.

276 Character 2: Okay, um, absolutely not. We're not—we're not doing the humble thing right now. You worked your ass off for this. Remember all those late nights you were basically living on coffee?

Character 1: Everyone worked hard.

277 Character 2: Sure, but like—okay yeah, everyone worked hard, but you got in. [Chuckle] That means something, y'know? Have you told your parents yet?

Character 1: Not yet. Might wait a bit.

278 Character 2: Oh man, they're gonna flip. Your mom's gonna—actually, she's probably gonna cry. Like, happy tears obviously, but still. Are you excited at all or just... terrified?

Character 1: Both, I guess. Mostly tired.

279 Character 2: Yeah, I bet you're just—emotionally exhausted, right? All that waiting and wondering and now it's like... boom, it's real. When do you start?

Character 1: September. Still seems fake.

280 Character 2: September's gonna come so fast though. Oh my god, we gotta celebrate! Like, properly celebrate—not just grabbing coffee or whatever. This is literally life-changing stuff.

Character 1: It's just school.

281 Character 2: Just school? [Laugh] Babe, this program is like—people would kill to get in. You beat out hundreds of people. That's not "just" anything, that's incredible.

Character 1: Maybe. We'll see how it goes.

282 Character 2: Okay okay, I know you're being all cautious and whatever, but like—can you at least admit you're a tiny bit proud? Because I'm so fucking proud of you I could scream.

Script: cbf951aa_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about what you've been doing.

283 Character 2: Oh—um, okay. What's—what's going on? Did I do something? I mean, obviously I must've done something if you're looking at me like that, but I honestly don't know what—

Character 1: Really? You don't know?

284 Character 2: No, I—wait, is this about yesterday? Or like, the thing at lunch? Because if it's about the comment I made about your presentation, I was trying to help! I thought—I thought you'd wanna know about the typo before—

Character 1: It's everything. The typo. My outfit last week. How I talk too fast. How I laugh too loud.

285 Character 2: Oh. Oh god. I didn't—[nervous laugh] okay, that's not—I wasn't trying to criticize you. I swear I wasn't. Those were just, like, observations? No wait, that sounds worse. I mean—

Character 1: Do you have any idea how it feels?

286 Character 2: I'm—I'm realizing now how it must've seemed and I feel terrible. Like, genuinely awful. I thought I was being helpful? Y'know, like a good friend who points out stuff so you don't—but that's not—that's not what I was doing, was it. [Groan] God, I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: Every single day, there's something wrong with me apparently.

287 Character 2: No no no, that's not—there's nothing wrong with you! I just have this stupid habit where I, um, I notice things and then my mouth just—goes. Without thinking about how it sounds. My mom literally does the same thing to me and I hate it, so I don't—I don't know why I thought it was okay.

Character 1: It's exhausting.

288 Character 2: I know. I mean—I don't know know, but I can imagine. Actually, no, I do know because my mom—yeah. [Sigh] Look, I'm gonna work on it, okay? Like really work on it. I need to just... shut up sometimes. Most of the time, probably.

Character 1: I don't need you to fix me.

289 Character 2: You don't—you never needed fixing! That's the thing, right? Like, you're already—you're great. The way you laugh? It's actually one of my favorite things about you. And talking fast just means you're excited about stuff, which is—that's awesome. I'm just an idiot who doesn't think before I speak.

Character 1: You really didn't realize?

290 Character 2: I honestly didn't. Which I know sounds—I know that sounds so dumb, but I thought it was like, y'know, what friends do? But it's not. It's what jerks do. And I've been a jerk to you without even—without even realizing it, which almost makes it worse somehow.

Character 1: Yeah. It kind of does.

291 Character 2: I'm sorry. Like, really truly sorry. Not just—not just saying it, I mean it. I never wanted to make you feel bad about yourself. That's literally the last thing—you're one of my best friends and I've been making you feel awful. I gotta—I gotta be better. I will be better.

Character 1: I just need you to stop picking me apart.

292 Character 2: I will. I promise I will. No more—no more comments about anything unless you specifically ask for my opinion, which, honestly, you probably shouldn't because apparently I'm terrible at—sorry. Stopping now. [nervous laugh] But seriously, I'm gonna be so much more careful. You deserve better from me.

Script: e2c517c6_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: This is the third time this month.

293 Character 2: I know, I know how it looks but—okay, hear me out. It's not that I'm trying to make excuses, it's just that there's always these circumstances that—um, that make things more complicated than they seem, y'know?

Character 1: There always are.

294 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, I guess I do say that a lot. But honestly, this time was different because my boss literally changed the deadline without telling me and I—wait, that's another excuse, isn't it? [nervous laugh] God, I'm doing it right now.

Character 1: Yep.

295 Character 2: I just—I dunno why I do this. Like, I wanna take responsibility, I really do, but then my mouth just starts going and suddenly I'm explaining why it wasn't really my fault and—shit, you must be so sick of this.

Character 1: I told you I was done listening to this last week. Remember?

296 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, you did. And I promised I'd stop and then I—[sigh] immediately went back to doing the exact same thing. That's... that's really messed up of me, actually.

Character 1: It's exhausting.

297 Character 2: I bet it is. I mean, I'm exhausting myself at this point, so I can't even imagine how you—wait wait, let me just say this: you're right. About all of it. I keep deflecting and making excuses and basically refusing to own up to anything.

Character 1: Why?

298 Character 2: I think I'm—okay this is gonna sound pathetic but I'm kinda terrified of people being disappointed in me? So I make these excuses to like, soften things? But that's just making everyone more disappointed in me, isn't it? [groan] God, I'm an idiot.

Character 1: You're not an idiot. You're just frustrating as hell sometimes.

299 Character 2: That's—that's fair. Really fair, actually. And you've been trying to tell me this for months and I just kept brushing it off with more excuses about why I make excuses, which is like, meta-level annoying.

Character 1: Yeah, it is.

300 Character 2: I'm gonna—I mean, I want to work on this. For real this time, not just saying it to make you feel better. Would you maybe help me? Like, call me out when I start doing it?

Character 1: I've been calling you out. That's literally what this conversation is.

301 Character 2: No, you're right, you're totally right. Um, what I meant was—actually, y'know what? I'm gonna stop talking and just... actually follow through for once. Actions, not words, right?

Character 1: That would be nice. Look, I don't want to lose you as a friend, but something's got to change.

302 Character 2: It will. It will, I promise. And I know—I know my promises haven't meant much lately, but just... thanks for not giving up on me yet. Even though you probably should've.

Script: a9a9a533_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I saw you with Madison yesterday. All smiles.

303 Character 2: Oh. Oh god, you saw that? I was just—she cornered me at the coffee shop and I didn't know what to do, so I just kinda... went with it? I know how it looked.

Character 1: You literally called her a toxic nightmare last week.

304 Character 2: I know! I know I did, and she is—she totally is, but like... [nervous laugh] I can't just be rude to her face, y'know? That's not—I mean, what am I supposed to do, just ignore her?

Character 1: Yes.

305 Character 2: Okay but—wait wait, that's so much harder than it sounds! You don't understand, she's friends with literally everyone at work and if I'm mean to her, it's gonna make my life hell.

Character 1: So you're fake instead. Got it.

306 Character 2: No no no, that's—that's not fair. I'm not being fake, I'm being... professional? Civil? [sigh] Okay fine, maybe a little fake, but it's not like I'm inviting her to brunch or anything.

Character 1: You complimented her presentation. The one you said was "aggressively mediocre."

307 Character 2: Oh my god, you heard that too? I was trying to—look, everyone else was saying nice things and I didn't wanna be the only one who didn't say anything, so I just... mumbled something vague about the color scheme.

Character 1: This is exhausting to watch.

308 Character 2: I know. Trust me, it's exhausting to do too. But I don't—I honestly don't know how else to handle it. Like, I can't be the person who's just mean to people, even if they deserve it. That's not who I am.

Character 1: But you're not being who you are anyway.

309 Character 2: That's... [groan] okay, that actually hurt. Because you're right. You're completely right and I hate it. I just—I get so anxious about confrontation that I end up doing this stupid performance instead.

Character 1: It makes me wonder what you say about me.

310 Character 2: What? No—oh my god, no no no. Never. I would never—you're my best friend, I don't talk about you like that. This is different, Madison's not—she's not you. She's not even really my friend, she's just... there.

Character 1: How do I know that's true?

311 Character 2: Because I'm—okay, because I'm telling you the truth about her right now, aren't I? Like, I'm admitting she drives me crazy. I wouldn't do that if I was gonna turn around and be fake with you too. I know I'm a people-pleaser but I'm not—I'm not fake with the people who actually matter.

Character 1: Maybe try being less fake with everyone. It's not a good look.

312 Character 2: You're right. You're... totally right. I gotta stop doing this—it's not fair to anyone, honestly. Not to them, not to me, and definitely not to you. [nervous laugh] I'm sorry you had to watch me be such a coward. I'll try to—I'll do better. I promise.

313 SCENARIO: attempting to get a sticker off cleanly

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I just need to, um, I just need to get this sticker off without— without tearing it or, like, leaving all that gross sticky residue everywhere. How hard can it be, right?

[slightly impatient]

Let me just— let me just try peeling from this corner here. Slowly. Super slowly. Come on, come on... [tsk] No, that's— that's already starting to rip. Great.

[resigned sigh]

Okay, um, maybe I need to, like, warm it up first? I think I heard that somewhere. Hair dryer? Or was it— was it heat or cold? [huh] I can never remember these, uh, these life hack things.

[thoughtful]

Wait, what about— what about that credit card thing? Where you, um, you kind of scrape under it? Let me just... gently... gently does it...

[brightening]

Oh! Oh, that's actually— that's actually working! Look at that, coming off in one piece like some kind of, uh, some kind of sticker removal genius over here.

[satisfied]

There we go. [exhale] See? Sometimes you just gotta, um, you just gotta think it through instead of going all— all caveman on it.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 628d85b3 | Role: Character 1 (A)

314 Character 1: [sharp tone] I just don't understand why you let Emma eat cookies before dinner. [getting louder] When you were little, we had rules—structure! [exasperated sigh] Now she's running around like a wild animal, and you just sit there smiling.

Character 2: [calmly] Mom, she had two small cookies after finishing her homework. [measured pace] It's not the catastrophe you're making it out to be. [softer] I want her to have a healthy relationship with food, not fear and restrictions.

315 Character 1: [scoffing] Healthy relationship? [bitter laugh] That's what you call letting a seven-year-old dictate meal times? In my day, children ate what they were given, when they were given it. [accusingly] No wonder she threw that tantrum at Thanksgiving.

Character 2: [defensive] She was overwhelmed by thirteen relatives she'd never met! [voice cracking] Any child would struggle with that much stimulation. [firmly] And she didn't dictate anything—we negotiated together, which teaches her valuable communication skills you never taught me.

316 Character 1: [wounded] Never taught you? [voice rising] I sacrificed everything to raise you properly! [trembling] You had piano lessons, tutoring, the best schools. [bitterly] But apparently teaching you discipline and respect was where I failed miserably.

Character 2: [exhausted tone] This isn't about your sacrifices, Mom. [deep breath] I'm grateful for what you did, truly. [pleading] But can't you see that Emma is thriving? She's creative, confident, and actually talks to me about her feelings.

317 Character 1: [mockingly] Oh yes, feelings—the answer to everything nowadays. [sharp laugh] When she can't handle real life because you've bubble-wrapped her emotions, don't come crying to me. [coldly] Mark my words, you're raising a snowflake who'll crumble at adversity.

Character 2: [hurt whisper] She's stronger than you think. [gaining strength] Yesterday, she mediated a conflict between two friends at school—something I never could've done at her age. [proudly] Because I was too busy trying to be perfect for you.

318 Character 1: [dismissive] Perfect? You were barely adequate! [frustrated groan] I had to push you because you were lazy, unfocused. [quieter] Without my guidance, you'd have amounted to nothing. And now you're repeating those mistakes with my granddaughter.

Character 2: [steady voice] I have a PhD, Mom. [incredulous laugh] I run a successful practice helping families heal from exactly this kind of dysfunction. [sadly] Maybe if you could see past your need to control everything, you'd notice Emma actually enjoys spending time with her mother.

319 Character 1: [venomously] Your fancy degree doesn't make you a good mother. [pause] [softer] I see how tired you look, how Emma manipulates you. You think being her friend is more important than being her parent. [urgent whisper] She needs boundaries, sweetheart.

Character 2: [gently] I am tired, Mom—tired of defending every parenting choice I make. [shaky voice] But Emma doesn't manipulate me; she trusts me. [more firmly] There's a difference between boundaries and walls, and I refuse to build walls between us.

320 Character 1: [pleading tone] I'm only trying to help! [voice breaking] Every time I offer advice, you act like I'm attacking you. [sniffling] I raised three successful children, but suddenly my experience means nothing? Your sister agrees with me, you know.

Character 2: [wearily] Of course she does—she parents exactly like you do. [hollow laugh] And her kids barely speak to her now that they're teenagers. [determined] I want Emma to still want me in her life when she's grown, not just tolerate me.

321 Character 1: [quietly dangerous] So that's what you think? That your siblings just tolerate me? [voice shaking] After everything I've done, all the love I've given? [louder] You ungrateful little—[sharp intake] No, I won't stoop to your level.

Character 2: [apologetically] Mom, I didn't mean—[sigh] Look, I know you loved us the only way you knew how. [carefully] But love isn't just about sacrifice and discipline. Sometimes it's about acceptance and trust, letting children be themselves.

322 Character 1: [defeated whisper] Be themselves. [bitter chuckle] That's rich, coming from someone who needed therapy for ten years to figure out who she was. [accusatory] But fine, raise Emma your way. [dramatically] I'll just watch from the sidelines.

Character 2: [sympathetically] You don't have to watch from the sidelines, Mom. [hopeful] Emma adores you, and so do I, despite our differences. [warmly] But we need you to respect that I'm her mother now, making choices from love, just like you did.

323 Character 1: [skeptical tone] Choices from love. [long pause] [reluctantly softer] I suppose we both want what's best for her, even if we disagree on methods. [strained] Maybe I could try to... hold my tongue more. [quickly] But only if you actually listen sometimes.

Character 2: [relieved laugh] I'd like that, Mom—really. [tenderly] And maybe I could try being less defensive when you do share your thoughts. [smiling through tears] Emma needs both of us, our different perspectives. [hopefully] Think we could manage a truce for her sake?

Script: 3032aeee | Role: Character 1

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I've been calling about this for weeks—my warranty number is RW-7829-JK, [getting louder] and now you're telling me it's void? [exasperated sigh] The leak at 4521 Oak Street started just two months after installation!

324 Customer Support: Sir, our records clearly show that you had unauthorized modifications done on May 15th. The warranty terms, which you signed, specifically state that any third-party work——immediately voids coverage.

Character 1: [outraged] Third-party work? [scoffs] Your own subcontractor came out here, invoice number INV-9982-B! He said the initial install was, was completely wrong, [desperately] missing underlayment on the entire north section!

325 Customer Support: That subcontractor wasn't authorized by our main office. You should've called the hotline at 1-800-ROOF-FIX first, not some random guy with our company shirt.

 Character 1: [shouting] Random guy? [incredulous] He had your company van, license plate RFG-4421! [groans] How was I supposed to know he wasn't—look, just look at this damage spreading!

326 Customer Support:  The van means nothing without proper work order verification. Section 12.3.B of your contract clearly states all repairs must go through dispatch, not field technicians directly.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, now you're quoting subsections at me. [getting angrier] My ceiling collapsed in bedroom three yesterday! [desperately] Insurance claim number CL-00567 is pending but they need your warranty confirmation!

327 Customer Support: Unfortunately, without following proper protocol, we can't honor any warranty claims. You'll need to file form WD-77 for review, [pause] though honestly, approval seems unlikely given these circumstances.

Character 1: [pleading] This is insane—I paid $18,500 for this premium package! [voice breaking] My kids can't even sleep upstairs anymore, and and you're worried about [bitterly] paperwork technicalities from paragraph whatever?

328 Customer Support: Sir, the premium package doesn't exempt you from warranty conditions. If you'd like to dispute this, call corporate at extension 4429, but the decision stands today.

Character 1: [defeated] So that's it? [voice rising again] Account number RF-2023-8847, perfect payment history, five star reviews—[chuckles bitterly] none of that matters because of one miscommunication?

329 Customer Support: Look, I understand your frustration, really. But my hands are tied by policy 2.7.A here. Maybe try calling Monday, ask for supervisor Jenkins, badge J-4471.

Character 1: [suspicious] Jenkins? [hopefully] Wait, are you saying he might actually help? [urgently] Because the adjuster comes Tuesday at 2 PM and I need—I really need something in writing!

330 Customer Support: [carefully] I'm not saying anything officially. But Jenkins has override code authority for situations involving, uh, [pause] potential installation errors from batch crews 300 through 350.

Character 1: [confused] Batch crews? [eagerly] We had crew 342 do our install—April 3rd! [gasps] Does that mean there's actually a known issue with those teams?

331 Customer Support: I didn't say there were issues. [nervously] Just that certain crew numbers between those ranges have, have different review procedures. Don't mention I told you this.

Character 1: [determined] Right, okay, so Monday morning, Jenkins, extension 4429. [calculating] And I should reference crew 342 and the, the override protocols? [relieved sigh] This better work.

332 Customer Support: Just stick to the facts about your installation date and crew number. And bring documentation—receipt R-9847-C would help. [pause] That's all I can suggest right now.

Character 1: [grateful but frustrated] Fine, I'll try that route. [sarcastically] Though it's ridiculous that I need secret codes and [sighs] insider knowledge just to get my roof fixed properly!

333 Customer Support: Is there anything else regarding today's inspection I can document? Otherwise, I'll note warranty claim WC-7829 as pending review, subject to supervisor approval per standard procedure.

Script: 9be53f45 | Role: Customer Support

334 Customer Support: Doctor Miller's office, this is Sarah speaking, how can I help you today? [more quickly] We're quite busy this morning so—uh—please let me know what you need.

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I've been trying to refill my blood pressure medication for three days now. [sighs heavily] The pharmacy keeps saying they need authorization but nobody's called me back.

335 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh, I see, let me just pull up your file here. What's your last name and date of birth please?

Character 1: [impatiently] Johnson, April fifteenth, nineteen-seventy-two. [more urgently] Look, I only have two pills left and my blood pressure's been really high without them.

336 Customer Support: Okay Mr. Johnson, I'm seeing here that—hmm—the refill request came in but it looks like your insurance requires a prior authorization for this particular medication now.

Character 1: [exasperated] But I've been taking the same medication for five years! [groans] Why would they suddenly need authorization for something that's been working?

337 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, these insurance changes are—well—they're ridiculous sometimes. Let me speak with Dr. Miller directly and see if we can expedite this today.

Character 1: [desperately] Can't he just give me a few pills to get through until this gets sorted? [pleading] I really can't go without this medication, it's dangerous.

338 Customer Support: Actually yes, we can probably do an emergency supply. Hold on one moment while I—uh—check with the doctor about getting you at least a week's worth.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank God, that would be amazing. [more calmly] I just don't understand why everything has to be so complicated with insurance these days.

339 Customer Support: Between you and me, we deal with this nonsense all day long. The insurance companies make it harder every year to just help patients get what they need.

Character 1: [appreciatively] Well I really appreciate you helping me out here. [curiously] How long do you think the full authorization will take to go through?

340 Customer Support: Usually it's forty-eight to seventy-two hours but—listen—we'll mark it as urgent. Dr. Miller is really good about pushing these through when patients are running out.

Character 1: [worriedly] And you're sure the pharmacy will give me the emergency supply today? [hesitant] Sometimes they say they need special paperwork or something.

341 Customer Support: I'm sending it electronically right now with very clear instructions. Seven-day emergency supply, and I'm putting a note that you'll pick it up within the hour.

Character 1: [gratefully] You're a lifesaver, seriously. [chuckles softly] I was starting to panic about what I'd do this weekend without my medication.

342 Customer Support: That's what we're here for, Mr. Johnson. Oh, and make sure you check with your insurance about any medication changes for next year during open enrollment.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] That's actually really good advice, I never think to look at that stuff. [sighs] I just assume everything stays the same but clearly that's not true anymore.

343 Customer Support: Exactly, and if they do change things, let us know right away so we can—you know—find alternatives before you run out. [quickly] The emergency supply should be ready in twenty minutes.

Character 1: [relieved] Perfect, I'll head over there now. [sincerely] Thanks again for being so helpful and actually listening instead of just transferring me around like usual.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

344 [Disappointed] So, um, remember that drill you borrowed for, like, "just the weekend"? [Sigh] That was three months ago, dude.

345 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, take my favorite hoodie too—I mean, why not, right? [Tsk] It's not like I ever see my stuff again anyway.

346 [Angry] [Fast] You literally have half my kitchen at your place and I'm eating cereal with a fork because you have all my spoons!

347 [Whisper] Honestly, I've started telling him things are broken when he asks to borrow them. [Chuckle] Is that terrible?

348 [Happy] Wait, you're actually returning something? [Laugh] This is—wow, should I take a picture to commemorate this historic moment?

349 [Sad] I dunno, it's just... I feel like you don't respect my stuff, y'know? [Slow] Or maybe you don't respect me.

350 [Shout] That was my grandmother's necklace! [Angry] You can't just—how do you lose something that important?!

351 [Fast] Okay so basically I need my tent back before Friday because I'm going camping and—wait, you still have it, right? [Disappointed] Please tell me you still have it.

352 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Let me guess... you "forgot" it at home again, even though I reminded you, like, seventeen times yesterday.

353 [Whisper] [Fast] Quick, hide the car keys—she's coming over and she'll definitely ask to borrow the car for "five minutes."

354 [Chuckle] Remember when you borrowed twenty bucks for lunch and then, uh, somehow that turned into you basically never paying for anything? [Sarcastic] Good times.

355 [Angry] [Slow] I'm gonna be really clear here—no, you cannot borrow anything else until you return what you already have.

356 [Happy] You brought my blender back! [Fast] And it's—oh wait, is that duct tape holding the lid on?

357 [Disappointed] [Sigh] My mom keeps asking where that casserole dish went and I can't keep making up excuses for you, okay?

358 [Sad] It's not even about the money or the—I just, I miss being able to trust you, I guess. [Slow] We used to be different.

359 [Tsk] So apparently "borrowing" now means "keeping forever"—cool, cool, just wanted to make sure I understood the new rules. [Sarcastic]

360 [Shout] [Fast] Dude, that's my work laptop with all my presentations on it—I literally need it back right now!

361 [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda bought duplicates of everything just so I'd have backups when you inevitably don't return stuff. [Chuckle]

362 [Angry] You said you'd—actually, y'know what? [Groan] I'm done having this same conversation every single week.

363 [Disappointed] [Slow] I found my hedge clippers at a garage sale yesterday... your garage sale, to be specific.

364 SCENARIO: Casually talking about a confidential thing they mentioned casually, then remembering who was around, then realizing someone who shouldn't know definitely heard, ending in trust violation panic

==================================================

[casual]

So I was telling Rebecca about the whole situation with my mom's surgery next week. You know, just venting about how stressed I've been, how we're trying to keep it low-key since she doesn't want the whole family drama thing.

[conversational]

And Rebecca was being super sweet about it, asking if I needed anything, offering to cover my shifts if I need to drive down there. Just— you know, normal friend stuff.

[slight concern creeping in]

But then I'm thinking back to where we were having this conversation, and we were in the break room, right? And I'm trying to remember who else was around because—

[realization dawning]

Oh wait. Wait, was Marcus there? [pause] Marcus was definitely there. He was— he was getting coffee when I was talking about the whole thing with Mom not wanting anyone to know yet.

[growing worry]

And Marcus— oh god, Marcus is dating my cousin Jenny. They've been together like six months now and they tell each other everything. Everything.

[panic building]

[sharp exhale] If he tells Jenny, she's gonna call my mom immediately. She's gonna be so hurt that Mom didn't tell her directly, and then Mom's gonna know I said something when I specifically promised—

[full panic]

[groaning] Oh my god, what have I done? Mom is gonna kill me. She's gonna— [whimper] I've completely betrayed her trust over coffee small talk!
