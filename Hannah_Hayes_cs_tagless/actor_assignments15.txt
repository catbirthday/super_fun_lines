Script: 096b6194_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three days. You left me on read for three days.

1180 Character 2: I know, I know, okay? But it's not like I was ignoring you on purpose. I literally just—things got crazy and I meant to respond but then I completely forgot. It happens.

Character 1: It happens.

1181 Character 2: Don't do that. Don't just repeat what I say like—[sigh] look, I get that you're mad, but I've been dealing with a lot. My brain's been everywhere and honestly, I can barely keep track of anything right now.

Character 1: I needed you.

1182 Character 2: And I'm sorry about that, I am, but like—you can't expect me to be available 24/7. Sometimes I just... I dunno, I get overwhelmed and I shut down. That's not about you.

Character 1: Sure felt like it was.

1183 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's not fair. You're acting like I deliberately chose to hurt you when really I just... I saw your message, thought I'd respond later when I had more energy, and then completely spaced. [frustrated laugh] It literally had nothing to do with you.

Character 1: You had time to post stories though.

1184 Character 2: Oh come on, seriously? Posting a stupid meme takes two seconds. Responding to actual conversations when you're already drowning in—that's different and you know it. You're being kinda unfair here.

Character 1: Am I?

1185 Character 2: Yeah, actually, you are. Like, I'm trying to explain what happened but you're just—you're not even listening. You've already decided I'm the bad guy here, haven't you?

Character 1: You could've just said you were overwhelmed.

1186 Character 2: I'm saying it now! And honestly, sometimes I don't even realize how bad it is until like, days later when I'm coming up for air and—shit, I forgot to text back like five people, not just you.

Character 1: So I'm just one of five people you ignored.

1187 Character 2: That's not what I—[groan] you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I messed up, okay? I should've responded. But you're acting like this is some huge betrayal when it's just... I'm human, I forget things when I'm stressed.

Character 1: Whatever.

1188 Character 2: No, not whatever. Don't do that. I'm trying here, but you gotta meet me halfway. Like, have I ever intentionally blown you off before? Have I ever not been there when you really really needed me?

Character 1: You weren't there this time.

1189 Character 2: And I'm sorry about that, okay? I am. But I'm also not gonna stand here and let you make me feel like garbage for being overwhelmed and making a mistake. That's—I dunno, that's not what friends do either.

Script: 2bdbd095_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You laughed at me.

1190 Character 2: Wait, what? I—okay, hold on, I thought you were being sarcastic! You had that tone, y'know? The one you always use when you're messing around.

Character 1: I was talking about my dad's diagnosis.

1191 Character 2: Oh god—I didn't—look, you literally just said "guess who's joining the chemo club" and did that weird [nervous laugh] half-smile thing. How was I supposed to know you were being serious?

Character 1: Maybe by listening to the actual words.

1192 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not fair. You joke about dark stuff all the time! Remember last week when you said your car died and I was all sympathetic and you were like "gotcha, it just needs gas"?

Character 1: This wasn't last week.

1193 Character 2: No, I know, but I'm saying—I mean, you gotta understand why I thought... Look, I'm sorry I laughed, okay? But you're acting like I'm some kind of monster when honestly, you weren't exactly clear.

Character 1: Pretty sure "cancer" is clear enough.

1194 Character 2: You said "chemo club!" That sounds like—I dunno, that sounds like something you'd say as a joke! And you were smiling, kinda, so I just... [sigh] I reacted wrong, fine.

Character 1: Fine. That's all you've got?

1195 Character 2: What do you want me to say? I can't un-laugh. I feel terrible about it, obviously, but I also think you're being kinda unfair here. You deliver serious news like it's a punchline and then get mad when I—when I misread it.

Character 1: I was trying not to cry.

1196 Character 2: Well I didn't—how was I supposed to know that? I'm not psychic. You were doing your deflecting thing, the same voice you use when you're like, avoiding feelings or whatever.

Character 1: So you're blaming me now.

1197 Character 2: No! No no no, I'm not blaming—ugh, see this is what you do. You twist everything. I'm trying to explain that it was a misunderstanding, not that it's your fault.

Character 1: But also not yours, apparently.

1198 Character 2: It's—yeah, okay, it's partially mine. Happy? But honestly, if you'd just said "my dad has cancer" straight up, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. [frustrated exhale] Instead you made it sound like a bit.

Character 1: Right. My mistake.

1199 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. The passive aggressive thing. Look, I'm sorry about your dad, I really am. And I'm sorry I laughed. But I'm not gonna pretend like I'm a hundred percent the bad guy here when you basically set me up to fail.

Script: 89234181_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You could've warned me about Marcus.

1200 Character 2: I—what? How was I supposed to warn you about something I didn't even know was gonna happen? Like, I'm not psychic.

Character 1: You knew what he was like.

1201 Character 2: Okay okay, yeah, I knew he could be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I didn't think he'd—look, everyone knew that about him. You knew that about him too.

Character 1: Not like you did.

1202 Character 2: That's not—[scoff] seriously? You're gonna put this on me because I what, dated his roommate for like three months? That doesn't mean I had some insider knowledge about him screwing you over.

Character 1: You saw the signs.

1203 Character 2: What signs? No, honestly, what signs? Because I'm kinda getting tired of you acting like I had this—this crystal ball or something. I didn't see anything you couldn't have seen yourself.

Character 1: Right.

1204 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down on me. I mean, I get you're hurt, I really do, but you can't just [frustrated laugh] decide I'm the bad guy here because things went south.

Character 1: I needed you to have my back.

1205 Character 2: I did have your back! I always have your back, but I can't—I can't protect you from stuff I don't know is coming. That's not fair to ask.

Character 1: You had a feeling though. Didn't you.

1206 Character 2: Maybe I had a—a weird vibe or whatever, but that's not the same as knowing. You get weird vibes about people all the time and don't say anything. Remember Tyler? Remember how that turned out?

Character 1: That was different.

1207 Character 2: How? How was it different? Because from where I'm sitting, it's exactly the same except I'm not—[sigh] I'm not throwing it in your face like you're doing to me right now.

Character 1: Fine. Forget it.

1208 Character 2: No no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You don't get to just drop this bomb on me and walk away. I'm sorry you got hurt, okay? I really am. But I'm not gonna apologize for not being omniscient.

Character 1: I just thought you'd say something. Anything.

1209 Character 2: And maybe I should've, I dunno. But you gotta understand—I didn't know know. I just had this gut feeling, and honestly? You wouldn't have listened anyway. We both know you wouldn't have listened.

Script: 1f7234fd_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You lied to me. For Marcus.

1210 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know how this looks, but it's not—I mean, it is what it looks like but there's more to it, y'know? Marcus was in real trouble and I just—I couldn't let him—

Character 1: Save it.

1211 Character 2: No no no, please, just let me explain! He was gonna lose his job if anyone found out, and his kid—he's got a kid now, did you know that? And I thought, like, what's one little lie, right? [nervous laugh] Except it wasn't little to you, was it?

Character 1: You chose him over me.

1212 Character 2: That's not—that's not what I was doing! I swear to god, I wasn't choosing anyone, I was just trying to help and I—I messed up. I really, really messed up.

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

1213 Character 2: I know. And honestly? I've been feeling sick about it since it happened. Like, literally sick. Because you trusted me and I—[groan]—I completely betrayed that trust, didn't I? I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: How long were you planning to keep lying?

1214 Character 2: I wasn't planning—okay, that's a lie too. God, I can't even—I'm doing it again. I was gonna tell you, I swear I was, but then days kept passing and it got harder and harder to bring up, y'know?

Character 1: So you just kept lying instead. Great solution.

1215 Character 2: I know it was stupid! I know, okay? I just—I panicked and then I kept panicking and before I knew it I was in too deep and I didn't know how to fix it without making everything worse.

Character 1: Well, you failed at that too.

1216 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I did. [sigh] Look, I don't—I don't expect you to forgive me right away or anything. But you gotta know that our friendship means everything to me. Like, genuinely everything.

Character 1: Could've fooled me.

1217 Character 2: I deserve that. I do. But I'm gonna—I wanna make this right, somehow. Whatever it takes. Even if you hate me right now, which, like, totally understandable if you do.

Character 1: I don't hate you. I'm just... disappointed.

1218 Character 2: That's—that's actually worse. Oh god, that's so much worse. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna fix this, I promise. I'll tell Marcus I can't cover for him anymore, I'll—I'll do whatever you need me to do.

Character 1: Just... don't lie to me again. Can you manage that?

1219 Character 2: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I promise—and I know my promises probably don't mean much right now but—I promise. No more lies. Ever. [quieter] Thank you for even listening to me. I know I didn't deserve it.

1220 SCENARIO: deciding what to make for dinner with limited ingredients

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, dinner. I need to make dinner and I have, uh, I have literally nothing in this fridge. Well, not nothing, but like— [sigh] what is this even? Half a bell pepper, some, um, some sad looking carrots, and— oh, there's rice. There's always rice.

[slightly more upbeat]

Okay so rice, that's, uh, that's a start. Rice is good. Rice is— rice is reliable. And I've got, um, let me see what else... [hmm] there's that can of beans I bought like two weeks ago. Black beans? Yeah, black beans. That could work, right?

[uncertain]

So like, rice and beans, that's a thing people make. That's a, um, a real meal that real people eat. I could just— I could throw in the pepper and the carrots and call it, uh, call it a stir-fry situation? Is that what that is?

[picking up speed]

Wait, wait, do I have any, um, any spices that would make this not completely boring? Because plain rice and beans is just— that's just sad. That's like college sad.

[resigned but accepting]

You know what, um, some garlic powder, maybe some cumin if I can find it... it'll be fine. It'll be, uh, it'll be perfectly adequate. [soft laugh] Adequate dinner, coming right up.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: d15ca656 | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [breathless] Marcus, look at those towers! [louder] They're completely intact after all these centuries. [Gasping] The golden inscriptions are still glowing somehow—this changes everything we thought we knew about the Aztari civilization and their technology.

1221 Character 2: [whispered awe] I can't believe we actually found it. [trembling] Twenty years of searching, and here it stands. [Sharp intake] Wait—do you see those symbols moving on the walls? They're shifting like they're alive or something.

Character 1: [urgently] We need to document everything before the sun sets! [excited squeal] Oh my God, that's a perfectly preserved astronomical calendar! [faster pace] Quick, hand me the camera—no archaeologist has ever seen craftsmanship this intricate before in pre-Columbian ruins!

1222 Character 2: [nervous laugh] Should we really be touching anything? [quieter] This place feels... sacred, almost watchful. [Long exhale] The air tastes different here, metallic and ancient, like breathing in centuries of untold secrets waiting to be discovered.

Character 1: [dismissively] Don't be superstitious now! [enthusiastic shout] This is the discovery of the millennium! [Chuckle] Though I admit, those statues do seem to follow you with their eyes—probably just clever architectural angles designed to intimidate visitors.

1223 Character 2: [hushed reverence] Listen to that humming sound coming from the temple. [more slowly] It's almost like a heartbeat, rhythmic and deep. [Soft gasp] The entire structure must be hollow inside—imagine what treasures could be waiting in there!

Character 1: [determined] Then let's go investigate the inner chambers. [wavering slightly] Although... why are there no signs of decay anywhere? [thoughtfully] Even the fabric banners are pristine, as if someone's been maintaining this place all along.

1224 Character 2: [fearful whisper] Marcus, there are fresh footprints in the dust over there. [voice rising] Someone's been here recently—very recently. [Nervous giggle] Maybe we should radio base camp first, let them know what we've found before proceeding any further.

Character 1: [mockingly] And risk someone else claiming our discovery? [firm tone] Absolutely not happening! [Excited yelp] Besides, look at that jade altar—it's covered in hieroglyphs we've never seen before! This could rewrite history books completely!

1225 Character 2: [amazed] You're right, these symbols predate anything in our databases. [getting quieter] They almost look alien in origin. [Whistles softly] The precision of these carvings would be impossible even with modern tools—how did they achieve this?

Character 1: [contemplative] What if they had help we don't understand? [more excitedly] The legends always spoke of sky visitors! [Heavy breathing] That doorway ahead is opening on its own—the mechanisms still work after all this time somehow!

1226 Character 2: [panicked] That's impossible! Stone doesn't move by itself! [calmer] Unless there's some kind of counterweight system we triggered. [Shaky exhale] Either way, that chamber beyond looks untouched—we could be the first humans inside for millennia.

Character 1: [triumphantly] Then what are we waiting for? [softer] History is calling our names! [Delighted squeak] Can you imagine the academic papers, the lectures, the complete revolution in archaeological understanding this will bring to our field?

1227 Character 2: [reluctantly] Fine, but we stick together no matter what. [steadier voice] And if anything seems dangerous, we leave immediately. [Sharp laugh] Though I doubt ancient booby traps are still functional after all this time has passed.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Famous last words, my friend! [playful tone] But you're probably right about the traps. [Gasps loudly] Oh wow, the walls in here are covered in pure gold leaf—this wealth is absolutely staggering to behold!

1228 Character 2: [stunned silence] That's not just gold—those are star maps! [increasingly excited] Incredibly detailed astronomical charts! [Choking up] They knew about star systems we only discovered with telescopes—this knowledge shouldn't have been possible back then!

Character 1: [mysteriously] Unless they had telescopes we haven't found yet. [more intensely] Or something even better. [Nervous laughter] That pedestal in the center is holding something—it's glowing with its own light source, pulsing like it's alive!

1229 Character 2: [barely audible] Should we touch it? [stronger] Every instinct says no, but scientifically... [Trail off] The energy readings on my equipment are going absolutely crazy—whatever that thing is, it's still active and generating power somehow.

Character 1: [resolutely] We came here to make history! [gentler] Whatever happens, we do this together. [Deep breath] On three, we both reach for it—one, two—wait, do you hear those footsteps echoing behind us now?

1230 Character 2: [terrified whisper] Those aren't our footsteps, Marcus. [voice cracking] Someone's coming up the passage behind us. [Panicked gasp] The door we came through—it's sealing itself! We're trapped in here with whatever's approaching us right now!

Script: 64649556 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [angrily] This is absolutely unacceptable! [raising voice] You've completely destroyed my daughter's wedding dress—look at these stains! [groans] The wedding is this Saturday at the Riverside Manor on 4821 Oak Boulevard, and now what am I supposed to do?

1231 Customer Support: Ma'am, according to our records under ticket number J-7742-X, you signed the waiver acknowledging the dress had pre-existing wine stains. We did our best with the delicate lace, but some damage was already permanent.

Character 1: [outraged] Pre-existing? Are you kidding me right now? [sarcastically] Those tiny spots were nothing compared to this... this disaster! [getting louder] The entire hem is brown, and there's a huge tear that wasn't there before!

1232 Customer Support: I understand you're upset, but our cleaning log from Tuesday, October 3rd shows we documented every issue before processing. [clears throat] Your receipt copy should have the same information—customer ID 45821-B.

Character 1: [mockingly] Oh, your precious documentation! [shouting] Well, document this—I paid $189.50 for your so-called premium service, [bitterly] and you've ruined a $3,000 Vera Wang original that my daughter saved for two years to buy!

Customer 1 D6: [coldly] Ma'am, our premium service doesn't guarantee miracle results on damaged items. [more firmly] The care label clearly stated dry clean with caution, and [sighs heavily] frankly, wine stains older than 48 hours are nearly impossible to remove completely.

Character 1: [incredulously] You're blaming me for bringing it here? [voice breaking] I brought it to professionals—to your shop at 1156 Main Street that claims [mockingly] "40 years of excellence in garment care"—what a joke!

1233 Customer Support: [irritated] Look, I've been doing this for fifteen years, okay? That dress had oxidized stains, probably from improper storage at temperature above 72 degrees. We can't perform magic on neglected fabrics.

Character 1: [furiously] Neglected? How dare you! [voice trembling] I'm calling my lawyer, Jonathan Mills from Mills & Associates on Fifth Avenue. [threateningly] Your insurance better cover this because I'm suing for the full replacement cost plus emotional damages!

1234 Customer Support: Oh, please do call your lawyer. Our liability coverage under policy TX-9908-ML only covers up to $250 for specialty items unless you purchased additional insurance, which, according to my screen here, you declined.

Character 1: [desperately] This is insane—you can't just hide behind fine print! [pleading] Please, there must be something you can do. [more emotionally] The wedding photographer is arriving at 2:00 PM on Saturday, and we need this fixed somehow!

1235 Customer Support: I... I get that this is stressful. [sighs] Look, I can offer you a credit of $189.50 for the service, and maybe our seamstress could attempt repairs tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, no guarantees though.

Character 1: [skeptically] A credit? That's your solution? [more aggressively] I don't want store credit to this horrible establishment! [demands] I want you to pay for a replacement dress from Bridal Boutique at 7823 Washington Plaza, today!

1236 Customer Support: [firmly] That's not going to happen, ma'am. Our maximum payout, even with manager approval from Mr. Henderson, is $500. [tiredly] I can process that check today if you sign the settlement form W-122.

Character 1: [bitterly] Five hundred dollars wouldn't even cover the veil! [snorts] You know what, forget it. [more determined] I'm posting photos on every review site—Yelp, Google, Facebook—with your employee badge number, what is it?

1237 Customer Support: It's 3847, and go ahead! We have security footage from camera C-4 showing the dress condition at drop-off. [confidently] Our corporate office at 200 Industrial Parkway will back us up completely on this.

Character 1: [mockingly] Oh, how professional of you! [louder] I bet that grainy footage from your ancient cameras really shows those delicate beading details! [furiously] My daughter Amanda is going to be heartbroken when she gets back from Denver tonight!

1238 Customer Support: Ma'am, I'm trying to help here, okay? [more gently] What if we expedite ship it to our specialist in Dallas—facility code DTX-44? They might salvage it by Friday afternoon, but it'll cost an extra $275.

Character 1: [desperately] Friday afternoon? That's cutting it too close! [groans loudly] But I guess... I guess I don't have a choice. [defeated] When exactly would it arrive, and can you absolutely guarantee it by 5:00 PM?

1239 Customer Support: If we overnight it using tracking number beginning with EX7, it should arrive by 4:30 PM Friday. I'll personally call their manager, Mrs. Chen at extension 5502, but you'll need to sign liability waiver L-888 right now.

Script: dcc31496 | Role: Customer Support

1240 Customer Support: Thank you for calling MediCare Plus, my name is Sandra. I see you're calling about a formulary issue—how can I help you today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, I just got a letter saying my Lipitor isn't covered anymore? [voice rising] I've been taking it for three years, and now [pause] [exasperated] suddenly it's not on your list?

1241 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account and check the formulary changes for 2024. Can you verify your member ID, please?

Character 1: [sighs heavily] It's, uh, B-4-7... wait, no [correcting himself] B-4-9-2-2-8-1. [sarcastically] This is ridiculous—my doctor specifically said I need this medication, not some generic.

1242 Customer Support: I see your account now, Mr. Peterson. You're right, Lipitor moved to tier four, but we have atorvastatin on tier one—it's the same active ingredient.

Character 1: [angrily] The generic made me dizzy last time! [more firmly] My doctor tried that two years ago and we had to switch back. [groans] Why do you people keep doing this?

1243 Customer Support: [apologetically] I'm sorry you experienced that. [speaking faster] Have you considered filing an exception request? Your doctor can submit documentation about why you need the brand name specifically.

Character 1: [exhausted] How long does that take? [pause] [desperately] I only have four pills left, and my prescription needs refilling by Friday.

1244 Customer Support: Standard review takes seventy-two hours, but we can expedite it to twenty-four hours if your doctor marks it urgent. I can start the process now if you'd like.

Character 1: [skeptically] And what if it gets denied? [voice cracking] I can't afford three hundred dollars a month for medication. [bitterly] This insurance is supposed to help me, not—not bankrupt me.

1245 Customer Support: If the first exception is denied, you have appeal rights. [speaking quickly] Level one, level two, then external review—but honestly, with documented side effects, approval chances are good.

Character 1: [sighs] Fine, start the exception thing. [resigned] But what am I supposed to do until then? [sarcastically] Just skip doses and hope for the best?

1246 Customer Support: [quickly] Your doctor can provide samples, or [more carefully] we have a temporary override I can apply—gives you a one-time fill at tier two pricing while pending review.

Character 1: [surprised] Tier two? [calculating] That's still... sixty dollars instead of fifteen. [frustrated laugh] But I guess it's better than three hundred, right?

1247 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I know it's not ideal. [more briskly] The override goes through immediately, so you can fill today. Should I activate that for you now, Mr. Peterson?

Character 1: [defeated] Yeah, yes, do it. [pause] [tiredly] And you'll call me about the exception? Or do I have to keep calling back every day?

1248 Customer Support: [reassuringly] We'll send a letter within twenty-four hours of decision. But here's a reference number—X-J-9-0-3-4—you can check status anytime online or call back with that.

Character 1: [writing] X-J-9... [slowly] zero-three-four. [sighs] This is such a hassle. I've been a member for twelve years and this is how you treat people?

1249 Customer Support: [apologetically] I understand your frustration completely. I've noted everything in your file, and I'm flagging this for supervisor review too—sometimes that helps with exceptions.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well... thanks, Sandra. [pause] [wearily] I guess you're just doing your job. [resignedly] I'll have my doctor send that paperwork today.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1250 [Fast] Okay so, I walk in there, right, and everyone just stops talking—like, dead silence. [Tsk] It was so obvious they'd been talking about me.

1251 [Slow] You gotta understand something here... I've never, um, I've never done anything like that before in my entire life. [Sigh]

1252 [Angry] She literally said—and I'm quoting here—that I was being "dramatic"! [Shout] Me! Can you believe that?

1253 [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda knew something was off when he wouldn't look me in the eye. [Chuckle] Should've trusted my gut.

1254 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, apparently I'm the bad guy for, uh, for actually showing up on time. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Makes total sense.

1255 [Happy] And then—wait, this is the best part—he actually apologized! [Laugh] Like, genuinely said he was wrong!

1256 [Sad] I dunno, maybe I should've just... kept my mouth shut, y'know? [Slow] Maybe none of this would've happened.

1257 Was I supposed to just stand there and—actually, you know what? [Fast] [Angry] Yes, I said what I said and I meant every word.

1258 [Disappointed] The whole thing was basically a misunderstanding, but, um, nobody wanted to hear my side. [Sigh] Still don't, apparently.

1259 [Whisper] [Fast] I'm gonna tell you something but you can't—you absolutely cannot tell anyone else, okay?

1260 [Chuckle] Honestly? Looking back, it's kinda funny how worked up everyone got over, like, literally nothing. [Happy]

1261 [Slow] Three times. [Angry] I asked him three times to just... to just listen for one second. [Groan]

1262 [Sarcastic] Right, because I definitely woke up that morning thinking "hey, let's ruin everyone's day!" [Tsk] [Disappointed] That's exactly what I wanted.

1263 [Fast] [Happy] No no no, wait—I forgot the part where she tried to blame it on the dog! The dog!

1264 [Sad] [Whisper] I mean, if I could go back and—I dunno, maybe I wouldn't change anything actually.

1265 [Shout] Twenty dollars! [Angry] We're having this whole argument over twenty stupid dollars! It's insane!

1266 [Slow] You ever have one of those moments where you're like... this isn't actually happening to me right now? [Sigh] [Disappointed] Yeah.

1267 [Happy] [Fast] So I just started laughing—couldn't help it—and that's when everyone realized how ridiculous we were being!

1268 [Sarcastic] I'm sure my opinion doesn't matter, but, uh, since you asked so nicely... [Chuckle] Here's what really went down.

1269 [Disappointed] Look, I tried to—actually, forget it. [Sad] [Sigh] You've already made up your mind about what happened anyway.

1270 SCENARIO: Complaining about a full inbox, then most being spam they can mass delete

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my God, don't even get me started on my inbox right now. Like, I opened it this morning and there were literally— I'm not even exaggerating— there were like three hundred and forty-seven unread emails. Three hundred and forty-seven!

[overwhelmed]

I was just staring at my screen like, where do I even begin? Like, do I start from the top, do I scroll to the bottom, do I just— [sigh] I don't know, declare email bankruptcy and pretend it never happened?

[annoyed]
