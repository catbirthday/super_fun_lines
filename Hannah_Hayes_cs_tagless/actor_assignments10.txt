Character 1: You shared my location with Jake.

775 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I can explain. I know how this looks but it's not—it wasn't meant to be a big thing, I swear. He was literally just asking if you were coming to the party and I thought—

Character 1: You thought what exactly?

776 Character 2: I thought it would help! Like, he was gonna pick you up anyway and he didn't know if you were home or—wait wait wait, that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] Um, basically he said he was worried about you.

Character 1: That's not your call to make.

777 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right, I just—I dunno, I wasn't thinking? No that's—that's not an excuse either. I guess I just figured since you guys are friends it wouldn't be a big deal but obviously I should've asked first.

Character 1: I specifically turned off location sharing with him.

778 Character 2: Oh. Oh shit, I didn't—I had no idea. God, that makes this so much worse. I'm such an idiot, I should've realized there was a reason he was asking me instead of just—[groan] I'm so sorry.

Character 1: Do you share my location with other people too?

779 Character 2: No! No no no, absolutely not. This was literally the only time and I—honestly I felt weird about it even when I did it but he seemed so concerned and I thought I was helping but clearly I wasn't thinking about—about boundaries and stuff.

Character 1: I need privacy for a reason.

780 Character 2: I know. And I violated that and I—god, I feel terrible. Like genuinely awful about this whole thing. You trusted me with that information and I just... I betrayed that trust, didn't I?

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

781 Character 2: Can I—is there any way I can fix this? I mean, I already told Jake to delete the screenshot and made him promise not to bother you but like—that's probably not enough, right? [sigh] I really wanna make this right somehow.

Character 1: You can't just undo it.

782 Character 2: I know, I know. But maybe I can—okay this is gonna sound stupid but what if I give you my location? Like permanently? So you can see where I am whenever, y'know, as like a trust thing?

Character 1: That's not how trust works.

783 Character 2: Right. Yeah, no, you're—you're absolutely right. I'm just grasping at straws here because I hate that I hurt you. Like this is eating me up inside and I don't—I don't wanna lose you as a friend over my stupid mistake.

Character 1: Just... don't do it again. To anyone.

784 Character 2: I won't. I promise I won't, ever. And I'm—I'm really truly sorry. Thank you for even talking to me about this instead of just—y'know, cutting me off completely. That means a lot.

Script: 469d68ea_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. Hit 100k yesterday.

785 Character 2: Wait wait wait—are you serious? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! Like, I knew you were getting close but holy shit, 100k? That's literally insane!

Character 1: Yeah. Woke up to all these notifications. My phone crashed twice.

786 Character 2: Your phone— [Laugh] okay that's actually hilarious. But like, how are you feeling? You must be—I mean, this is huge, right? You've been grinding at this for what, like three years?

Character 1: Two and a half. Feels weird.

787 Character 2: Weird how? Like good weird or—actually no, I kinda get it. It's probably super overwhelming, huh? All those people just... watching you.

Character 1: That's the thing. It's just a number on a screen. Nothing's different.

788 Character 2: Okay but—but it is though? Like, you're gonna get that silver play button thingy! And honestly, the sponsorship opportunities must be— [Gasp] wait, have brands started reaching out already?

Character 1: Some. Mostly garbage. One wanted me to promote their "revolutionary" toe spacers.

789 Character 2: Toe spacers? I'm—no no no, that's too good. Please tell me you're considering it. Actually wait, what even is your audience demographic for that?

Character 1: Tech reviews. So... not toe people.

790 Character 2: Not toe people— [Chuckle] okay yeah, fair point. But seriously though, like, you must have some decent offers too? This is when things really start taking off, y'know?

Character 1: Maybe. I don't know. Might just keep doing what I'm doing.

791 Character 2: Which is—I mean, that's totally valid! You don't have to like, sell out or whatever. But um, you are gonna celebrate somehow, right? This is literally a massive milestone.

Character 1: Bought myself a coffee this morning. The large one.

792 Character 2: A large coffee. You—you absolute madman. No but really, we should—actually, you know what? Let me take you out for dinner or something. Like, proper dinner, not just pizza.

Character 1: I like pizza.

793 Character 2: Okay okay, pizza then! But like, the fancy place with the wood-fired oven and the burrata and all that bougie stuff. Because honestly? You've worked your ass off for this.

Character 1: Fine. But you're not making a scene when we get there.

794 Character 2: Me? Make a scene? I would never—okay actually that's fair, but I promise I won't, like, announce it to the whole restaurant or anything. Maybe just our waiter. [Laugh] Kidding! Mostly.

Script: dda25e9c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I got invited to join Meridian House.

795 Character 2: Wait wait wait—Meridian House? Like the—oh my god, the one downtown with the whole waitlist situation? How did you even—actually, no, of course you got in. You're like, literally perfect for that place.

Character 1: I don't know if I want to join.

796 Character 2: You don't—okay, um, can we just take a second here? Because this is kinda huge, right? Like people wait years for this. What's making you hesitate?

Character 1: It's ten thousand a year. Plus the initiation fee.

797 Character 2: Oh. Oh wow, that's—[Exhale] yeah, that's real money. I mean, obviously you can afford it, but like... that's still a lot to just drop on a club, y'know?

Character 1: My dad's a member. He nominated me.

798 Character 2: Your dad—oh. Ohhhh, okay okay, now I'm getting it. This isn't really about the money, is it? It's the whole... family expectation thing?

Character 1: He's been planning this since I was twelve.

799 Character 2: Since you were—Jesus. That's like, that's a lot of pressure, babe. No wonder you're feeling weird about it. Have you, um, have you talked to him about maybe not wanting it? [Nervous laugh]

Character 1: That would go well.

800 Character 2: Right, no, stupid question. Your dad's not exactly Mr. Flexibility when it comes to tradition and stuff. But like—I dunno, what if you just tried it for a year? See how it feels?

Character 1: Maybe. The people there are... a lot.

801 Character 2: A lot like—wait, like snobby? Or just, y'know, intense? Because honestly, you can handle intense. You literally run board meetings.

Character 1: They collect yacht stories. Competitively.

802 Character 2: They collect—[Laugh] stop, are you being serious right now? That's actually hilarious. Like what, "my yacht's bigger than yours" kinda thing?

Character 1: Pretty much. And everyone's kid went to the same five schools.

803 Character 2: Ugh, yeah, that whole scene is just—I mean, it's so not you. You're like, you're real, y'know? But also... connections and whatever. Business stuff. Could be useful?

Character 1: That's what my dad keeps saying.

804 Character 2: Of course he does. Look, I'm gonna—actually, you know what? Whatever you decide, it's the right choice. Because you're the one who's gotta show up there, not him. [Sigh] Just don't let him guilt you into it, okay?

Script: ef2dff83_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I got the internship.

805 Character 2: Wait wait wait—are you serious? The one at—oh my god, the one you've been talking about for like, months? This is huge!

Character 1: Yeah. That one.

806 Character 2: I'm literally—okay I'm gonna cry [Laugh] because you worked so hard for this. Like, remember when you almost didn't even apply? And now you actually got it!

Character 1: Still doesn't feel real.

807 Character 2: No no no, this is—this is totally real, and you deserve every second of it. When do you start? Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna flip.

Character 1: Next month. Haven't told anyone. Except you.

808 Character 2: You told me first? That's—okay now I'm actually gonna cry. But like, are you excited? You seem kinda... I dunno, quiet about it?

Character 1: I'm terrified.

809 Character 2: Oh babe, that's so—that's completely normal though. Like, this is your dream job we're talking about. Of course you're scared! But also [Sigh] you're gonna be incredible.

Character 1: What if I mess it up?

810 Character 2: Okay, um, can I be real with you for a sec? You're not gonna mess it up. You're like, the most prepared person I know. Remember how you basically memorized their entire company history?

Character 1: That was excessive.

811 Character 2: No no, that was—that was dedicated. And they obviously saw that, right? They picked you out of, what, hundreds of applicants probably?

Character 1: Three hundred and twelve.

812 Character 2: Three hundred and—[Gasp] okay that's insane! You beat out three hundred people! How are you not literally screaming right now?

Character 1: I did. In my car. For about five minutes.

813 Character 2: Wait, you actually—that's amazing. I'm so proud of you for letting yourself feel it, y'know? Even if it was just for a minute.

Character 1: Thanks. For listening.

814 Character 2: Are you kidding? This is like—this is the best news I've heard all year. We're definitely celebrating, and I'm not taking no for an answer, okay?

815 SCENARIO: trying to remember if they locked the front door

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um— did I lock the door? I feel like I locked it, but, uh, but now I'm not— I'm not totally sure. I always lock it, right? Like, that's just, um, that's just what I do.

[slightly uncertain]

But I was, uh, I was rushing this morning because of the, um, the thing with my coffee maker, and I had to— I had to use the French press instead, which took forever, and then I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna be—

[faster, working through it]

Wait wait wait. Let me just— let me think about this. I grabbed my keys, I walked to the door, I opened it, stepped out, and then I— did I turn around? I feel like I turned around, but maybe I was just, uh, maybe I was just thinking about turning around?

[frustrated sigh]

[more animated]

This is— this is so annoying. Like, why can't I just remember doing something I literally do every single day? It's muscle memory, it should be— [tsk] I mean, it's not like it's complicated.

[resigned]

You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna assume I did it. Because I always do it, and, um, and statistically speaking, I probably— yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Probably.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 4f7cabf4 | Role: Character 1 (A)

816 Character 1: [shaking voice] They're here, they're finally here! [Sobbing] I can hear them breaking through the door—we're going to make it out. [gasping] After three days in this nightmare, [whispered] someone finally found us.

Character 2: [muffled crying] Hold me tighter, please don't let go yet. [trembling] What if it's not really them? [more frantically] What if they're just pretending to be police and this is another trick to break us?

817 Character 1: [louder now] No, listen to those voices—that's SWAT protocol! [Choking sob] My brother's a cop, I know how they announce themselves. [weakly] We just have to stay down until they clear the room, okay?

Character 2: [hysterical] I can't feel my legs anymore from sitting like this. [Whimpering] The zip ties cut so deep, there's blood everywhere. [barely audible] Promise me if something goes wrong, you'll tell my daughter I fought to come home.

818 Character 1: [fierce whisper] Nothing's going wrong—we're both walking out! [Crying harder] You'll tell her yourself at bedtime tonight. [determined] Look at me, breathe with me, we're survivors. [softer] In and out, just like we practiced these past hours.

Character 2: [panicked scream] They're shooting! Oh god, they're shooting at them! [lower now] Get down, get down further into the corner. [Gasping] I can smell the smoke from the flashbangs—it's burning my throat so bad.

819 Character 1: [urgent tone] That's our guys doing the shooting, not them! [reassuring] Cover your ears, it'll be over soon. [Sob breaking through] I'm so sorry I got you into this mess—this is all my fault.

Character 2: [firmly] Stop that right now, this isn't on you. [quivering] We both just worked at the wrong bank. [Bitter laugh] Who knew Tuesday morning shifts could end like this? [trailing off] I just wanted to deposit my paycheck.

820 Character 1: [hopeful whisper] I can see boots—military boots through the smoke! [getting louder] Over here, we're over here behind the counter! [Ragged breathing] Two civilians, we're unarmed! [pleading] Please see us before you shoot, please!

Character 2: [screaming] Don't shoot, we're the hostages! [more desperately] We're behind the teller station three! [Wheezing] My hands are tied, I can't raise them! [sobbing] Please believe us, we're not with them!

821 Character 1: [relieved crying] They see us, they're coming this way! [shakily] That officer is signaling to stay still. [Gasping sob] Look at his eyes—kind eyes, not like theirs. [whispered] We're really going home, aren't we?

Character 2: [exhausted] I can't stop shaking, even knowing we're safe. [slowly] Everything hurts but nothing matters except getting out. [Quiet sob] Will you stay with me at the hospital? [more urgently] I don't want to be alone yet.

822 Character 1: [gently] Of course I'll stay, we're trauma bonded for life now. [Half-laughing, half-crying] We'll get matching therapists, maybe a support group. [serious tone] But first, let's let these heroes cut these damn ties off our wrists.

Character 2: [dazed] Is that sunlight through the door? [Weeping] I thought I'd never see daylight again. [stronger voice] When that man put the gun to my head yesterday, I made peace with dying. [breaking] But not today.

823 Character 1: [emotional] You kept me sane when I wanted to give up. [gratefully] Every time you squeezed my hand, I remembered why to fight. [Shuddering breath] My kids need their mom, and you reminded me of that truth.

Character 2: [hoarse whisper] The officer's reaching for us now—it's really over. [Sobbing harder] His hands are so gentle cutting the ties. [amazed] How can someone be this careful after all that violence? [sniffling] These are angels, not men.

824 Character 1: [overwhelmed] Can you stand? Here, lean on me like we practiced. [encouraging] One step, then another, just like we talked about. [Breaking down] The ambulance lights are so beautiful—red and blue never looked so good before.

Character 2: [weakly] My family must be outside, probably going crazy with worry. [teary] Your husband too—I heard you whisper his name in your sleep. [Exhausted laugh] We know each other's secrets now, [warmly] stranger who became my sister.

825 Character 1: [quietly joyful] Look at all those people cheering for us! [disbelief] We're on the news—we're the survivors they're talking about. [Shaky breath] Tomorrow we'll be statistics, but today we're miracles. [firmly] We lived when others didn't.

Character 2: [peacefully] Hold my hand until we reach the ambulance? [stronger now] I want to remember this walk to freedom. [Deep breath] Every step away from that hell, every breath of free air. [crying softly] We made it out together.

Script: 24f32cba | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my HSA account—number 4782-B9X—and I need to know if, um, [hesitant] can I use it for my daughter's gymnastics classes? [hopefully] She has, you know, some coordination issues the doctor mentioned.

826 Customer Support: Good morning, thank you for calling HealthFlex HSA support. I'd be happy to help you with eligible expenses. Generally, gymnastics classes aren't covered unless there's a specific medical diagnosis and a letter of medical necessity from your physician.

Character 1: [rambling] Oh, okay, well the thing is—wait, let me find that paper—her pediatrician Dr. Morrison at 2847 Oak Street said something about, [trails off] um, developmental delays? [suddenly louder] But what about my essential oils from last Tuesday, order number 88Z-4K?

827 Customer Support: Essential oils typically aren't eligible expenses either, unless prescribed for a specific medical condition. [more helpfully] Do you have the receipt and prescription information? We'd need documentation showing medical necessity for both items you've mentioned.

Character 1: [frustrated] This is so confusing! [sighs heavily] Last year my neighbor Janet used her HSA for massage therapy and nobody asked her for anything. [accusingly] Are you telling me my $247.83 from Wellness Boutique on March 15th isn't covered?

828 Customer Support: Every situation is unique, and massage therapy can be eligible with proper documentation. [more firmly] For your March 15th purchase, I'd need to verify what specific items were bought. Can you log into your account or provide the itemized receipt?

Character 1: [distracted] Hold on, my cat's doing something weird—sorry—[refocusing] okay so my login is, um, I think it's my email? [uncertain] The one with all the numbers, sarah1982... no wait, [muttering] sarah.jenkins82@something.

829 Customer Support: No problem, I can look you up differently. Can you verify your date of birth and the last four digits of your social? Once I access your account 4782-B9X, I can review your recent transactions.

Character 1: [quickly] January 8th, 1982, and it's 6745—no, [correcting herself] 6754! [suddenly excited] Oh, while you're looking, can contact lenses be covered? [hopefully] I bought like six months' worth for $389 because there was a sale at VisionMax.

830 Customer Support: Yes, contact lenses are absolutely an eligible expense! That's one of the standard vision care items covered under HSA guidelines. [informatively] You just need to keep your receipt, and if it's prescription contacts, you're all set—no additional documentation needed.

Script: 6e804853 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, this is the fourth time I've brought my car in for the same issue. [louder] The engine keeps stalling at red lights, and [exasperated sigh] nothing you guys do seems to fix it permanently.

831 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. Let me pull up your service history right away—I see here multiple visits for engine stalling. We're going to get to the bottom of this today, I promise.

Character 1: [sarcastically] That's what your colleague said last time, and the time before that. [groans] I've already paid over two thousand dollars, and I'm—I'm honestly considering just getting rid of the car altogether. [bitterly] This is ridiculous.

832 Customer Support: I hear you, and you're absolutely right to be upset. Here's what we're going to do differently—our master technician will personally inspect it, not just run diagnostics. No charge for today's inspection, obviously.

Character 1: [skeptically] Your master technician? [pause] Why wasn't he looking at it before? [angrier] I specifically bought this car from you guys because of your supposed excellent service department, but this is... [trails off] unacceptable.

833 Customer Support: You're right, he should have been involved earlier—that's on us. Between you and me, we've had some staffing changes that affected our process. But John, our senior tech, he's been here fifteen years and knows these engines inside out.

Character 1: [tiredly] I just need my car to work. [softer] My daughter's scared to drive with me now because we broke down on the highway last week. [more desperately] Can you guarantee this will actually fix it this time?

834 Customer Support: Oh no, that must have been terrifying for both of you. [more determined] I can't guarantee anything until John looks at it, but [briskly] here's what I can do—we'll provide a loaner car while we work on yours, no rental fees.

Character 1: [surprised] A loaner car? [cautiously hopeful] Well, that's... that's something at least. [sighs deeply] How long will this inspection take, because I've already missed work twice this month for this nonsense.

835 Customer Support: John can see it this afternoon—should have answers by five. If it's something we've missed before, we'll make it right, including refunding previous repairs that didn't address the real issue. That's my manager's commitment.

Character 1: [incredulous] Refunding previous repairs? [pause] I'll believe that when I see the check. [more calmly] But okay, fine, let's try this one more time with your master technician. [wearily] One more time.

836 Customer Support: Perfect, let me get you set up with that loaner right now. [reassuring] It's a newer model actually, fully insured by us. And Mr. Johnson, I'm giving you my direct line—any issues, you call me personally.

Character 1: [slightly warmer] I appreciate that. [firmly] But if this doesn't work, I'm not just done with the car—I'm done with this dealership. [pause] My whole family buys cars here, you know that, right?

837 Customer Support: We absolutely know, and we value that relationship immensely. [more urgently] That's why I'm escalating this to regional management as well—they need to know we've let you down. This isn't just about one car anymore.

Character 1: [surprised] Regional management? [thoughtfully] Well, maybe you're actually taking this seriously now. [sighs] I just want what I paid for—a reliable car that doesn't leave us stranded, is that too much to ask?

838 Customer Support: Not at all, that's the bare minimum you deserve. John just freed up—he can look at it in an hour actually. Would you like coffee while you wait, or should I have someone drive you home?

Character 1: [consideringly] I'll wait, but yeah, coffee would be good. [more cooperatively] And... thanks for actually listening this time. [quietly] The last service advisor just kept saying it was probably my driving style.

839 Customer Support: [indignantly] Your driving style? That's completely inappropriate—engine stalling isn't user error. I'm sorry you were told that, that's not how we should handle concerns, ever.

Character 1: [relieved] Finally, someone who gets it. [more hopefully] Okay, so one hour with John, then we'll know what's really going on? [cautiously] And you'll personally handle the follow-up?

840 Customer Support: One hour for initial assessment, yes, and I'm your point person from now on. [briskly] I'll text you updates as John works, so you're not left wondering. We're going to make this right, Mr. Johnson.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

841 [Disappointed] Um, okay so apparently the projector has decided to—yeah, it's just not gonna cooperate with us today. [Sigh]

842 [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, right when I get to the, uh, the most important slide, everything just goes black. [Tsk] Perfect timing, really.

843 [Happy] You know what, this is actually kinda refreshing—we can just, like, have a real conversation without all the PowerPoint stuff! [Chuckle]

844 [Fast] [Angry] I literally tested this three times this morning and it was—I don't understand why it's doing this now!

845 [Whisper] Can someone maybe, um, check if the cable in the back is—actually, never mind, I see the problem. [Slow]

846 [Shout] Does anyone here know how to—sorry, didn't mean to yell—does anyone know how to fix this thing? [Disappointed]

847 [Sad] I spent, like, two weeks preparing these visuals and now I'm just gonna have to wing it, I guess. [Sigh]

848 [Chuckle] Well, this brings back memories of presenting with, uh, with actual paper handouts, doesn't it? [Happy]

849 [Slow] [Disappointed] The irony is that my whole presentation is about, um, digital transformation and reliability.

850 [Fast] Okay everybody just—just give me thirty seconds, I'm gonna try rebooting the whole system real quick! [Angry]

851 [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Sure, let's all pretend this dramatic pause is totally intentional and part of my presentation strategy.

852 [Whisper] [Sad] I knew I should've brought backup slides on a USB or—or something, anything really.

853 [Happy] Actually, y'know what, forget the tech—let me just draw this out on the whiteboard old-school style! [Fast]

854 [Groan] This is literally the third time this month that this projector has—I mean, come on. [Disappointed] [Slow]

855 [Angry] [Fast] Who updated the software last night without telling anyone because this was working perfectly yesterday!

856 [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] I'd like to thank technology for keeping us all humble and, uh, reminding us who's really in charge here.

857 [Slow] So while we wait for this to—hopefully—come back to life, does anyone have any questions about what we've covered so far? [Disappointed]

858 [Sad] [Whisper] I can't believe this is happening at the quarterly review of all times—the CEO is literally right there.

859 [Laugh] [Happy] You know, my grandmother always said never trust anything you can't fix with a hammer!

860 [Tsk] [Fast] [Angry] Twenty minutes left and we're barely through the introduction because of this—this ridiculous equipment failure!

861 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly mentioning a mole removal they did themselves, then looking at it, then seeing it looks worse now, spiraling into DIY medical regret

==================================================

[matter-of-fact]

Oh, by the way, I removed that mole on my shoulder yesterday. You know, the one that was kind of raised? Just used some— uh, some nail scissors and tweezers. [casual] No big deal, saved myself like two hundred bucks at the dermatologist.

[conversational]

I mean, it wasn't that deep or anything. Just snipped it right off, put some antiseptic on it. [light] People do this stuff all the time, right? My mom used to cut off my dad's skin tags with nail clippers.

[slightly uncertain]

Actually, let me just... [pause] let me check how it's looking. I put a bandage on it this morning but I should probably— [trailing off] Oh. Hm.

[concerned]

That's... that's more red than I expected. And it's kind of, um... [nervous] it's kind of oozing? Like, not blood but this clear... [slight worry] this clear yellow stuff.

[growing anxiety]

Wait, is it supposed to be this swollen? [sharp exhale] Oh god, what if I— what if I didn't get it all? What if there's still part of it under the skin and now it's like... [panicking] infected or something?

[spiraling] [frantic]

I could have cancer! I could have literally spread cancer cells all through my shoulder! [whimper] People die from melanoma! What was I thinking?! [groaning] I'm such an idiot! I need to go to the ER right now!
