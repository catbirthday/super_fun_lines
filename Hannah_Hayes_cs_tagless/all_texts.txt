1 Wait wait wait—WHAT? You just—okay you can't just drop that like it's nothing! Oh my god, when did this happen? I need like, I need every single detail right now.
2 The beach? That's so—wait, wasn't that your anniversary trip? Oh my god, they actually did it! I mean, we all kinda knew it was coming but still, this is like [Gasp] this is huge!
3 I mean, not knew knew, but like... they asked me about ring sizes a while back? And I was trying so hard not to say anything because—god, keeping that secret was literally killing me.
4 But okay okay, how do you feel? Like, are you—I mean obviously you said yes, but are you excited? Freaking out? Both? Because honestly both would be totally normal.
5 No no, that makes total sense. It's like, even when you want something, actually having it happen is just—it changes everything, y'know? [Softer] In the best way though, right?
6 Oh god, already? That's—okay that's actually kinda hilarious but also terrifying? Like, you literally just got engaged and she's probably got spreadsheets and everything.
7 Three—[Laugh] stop it, you're joking. Actually no, wait, this is your mom we're talking about. She totally has binders. Has she mentioned the venue yet? Or like, the guest list?
8 Her book club? But they don't even—okay you know what? We're gonna deal with that later. Right now I wanna see this ring because I know it's gorgeous and you're just sitting there not showing me!
9 Oh my—babe, that's not just nice, that's perfect. Like, it's so you, if that makes sense? They really paid attention. God, I'm getting all emotional and it's not even my engagement [Laugh].
10 Yeah, I bet—I mean, it's gonna feel weird for a while, right? But like, good weird. The kind where you catch yourself staring at your hand randomly and thinking "holy shit, I'm actually doing this."
11 I—okay, yes, but before you freak out, she called me first. She was worried sick about you and I couldn't just—I mean, what was I supposed to say?
12 That's not—come on, that's not realistic. Your mom was literally crying on the phone because you haven't talked to her in weeks. I was trying to help.
13 No, you didn't. You never do. [Sigh] But you're also not dealing with this, and someone had to—I dunno, someone had to do something. You can't just ghost your entire family forever.
14 Yeah, well, your choices affect other people too, y'know? Your mom thinks she did something wrong, your sister keeps texting me asking if you're okay—I'm stuck in the middle here.
15 Actually, you kinda did when you made me your emergency contact and then decided to cut everyone else off. What am I supposed to—[frustrated laugh] okay, fine, I shouldn't have told her anything.
16 I told her you were alive and okay! That's it! I didn't—I didn't give her your new address or tell her about the job stuff or anything. Just that you needed space. That's literally all I said.
17 Maybe not, but honestly? Watching you self-destruct while your family falls apart isn't exactly easy for me either. I'm sorry I went behind your back, I am, but I'm not sorry I tried to help.
18 Fine, fine, it's interfering. But you know what? At least I'm doing something instead of just—instead of pretending everything's gonna magically fix itself if we all just ignore it long enough.
19 No, it's not. [Scoff] But apparently I care more about your family than you do right now, so yeah, I made a judgment call. Sue me.
20 I—look, I can't promise that if your mom calls me sobbing again, okay? I won't seek them out, but I'm not gonna lie if they ask me direct questions. That's the best I can do.
21 I—okay, I was gonna tell you. I swear I was gonna tell you, but we wanted to be sure it was actually something first, y'know? Like, what if it didn't work out and then it was weird for nothing?
22 It's not—it's not three months. [Sigh] Maybe like... two and a half? But look look, we didn't even know if it was serious at first. We were just hanging out and then it kinda... happened.
23 That's not fair. We weren't doing anything behind your back, we just—we didn't announce it immediately. There's a difference. You're acting like we were sneaking around plotting against you or something.
24 No, we were being private. About our relationship. Which—honestly? We're allowed to do that. I'm sorry you found out from Alex instead of us, I really am, but [frustrated laugh] we're adults, we don't need permission.
25 Then what? What is it about? Because I'm trying to understand why you're this pissed and I'm—I dunno, I'm not getting it. Jamie and I like each other. That's... that's not a crime.
26 Yeah, exactly! Which is why we wanted to be careful! If it went badly—god, can you imagine? The whole friend group would've imploded. We were trying to protect everyone, including you.
27 We didn't lie! We just—okay okay, fine, we didn't tell you. But that's not the same as lying. And honestly? The way you're reacting right now is kinda proving we were right to wait.
28 I didn't mean—[groan] that came out wrong. Look, I get that you're hurt. I do. And I'm sorry we didn't handle this better, but you gotta understand, we were scared. Scared of this, scared of ruining everything.
29 Did we though? Did we really ruin everything? Or are you just mad that something changed without you being in control of it? Because that's what this feels like, if I'm being honest.
30 Of course you are. You always—fine. Whatever. But when you're ready to actually talk about this like adults instead of making me the villain, you know where to find me. Jamie too.
31 Oh god, oh no—wait, which—actually, it doesn't matter. I'm so sorry. I didn't think—I mean, I wasn't thinking at all, obviously. I just thought it was funny and I wanted to share but that's not—that's no excuse.
32 I know, I know, and that was so wrong of me. Like, completely out of line. I deleted it right away—well, like five minutes later when I realized how messed up it was. [nervous laugh] Not that that makes it better.
33 No no no, you're right to be mad. I would be—I'd be furious if someone did that to me. I wasn't even thinking about how it was private, I just—I dunno, I got caught up in wanting everyone to laugh and I totally violated your trust.
34 Um, I think—I mean, yeah, probably most people saw it before I deleted it. But nobody said anything bad! They just thought it was funny that you—actually, that doesn't matter. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I?
35 Listen, I—I get that you probably don't wanna talk to me right now, and honestly, fair. But I need you to know that I'm genuinely, genuinely sorry. Like this isn't just me trying to—to make myself feel better or whatever.
36 I know. God, I know, and that makes it so much worse. You were being vulnerable with me and I just—I turned it into entertainment for other people. That's so gross of me. I hate that I did that to you.
37 And I completely broke that trust, I know. I'm gonna—I already told everyone in the chat that it was wrong of me to share it and asked them not to mention it again. I mean, damage is done, but at least—at least they know it was my fault, not yours.
38 No, it doesn't. You're right. Nothing really—nothing can undo it, can it? [sigh] I just, I wanna make this right somehow but I don't know how. Tell me what to do and I'll do it, I swear.
39 Never. Never ever, I promise. I learned my lesson—well, I should've already known better, but I mean—I will never screenshot anyone's private stuff again. That was such a breach of—of basic friendship rules, y'know?
40 Are we—I mean, I know we're not okay right now, and that's on me, but like... do you think we can be? Eventually? I really—I really don't wanna lose you as a friend over my stupid mistake.
41 Oh—okay, I can explain that. It wasn't like I deliberately left you off, the template only had room for one name and I figured—I mean, everyone knows we worked together on it.
42 Look look, I get why you're upset, but you're acting like I'm trying to steal all the glory here when that's not—that's not what happened. I literally mentioned you in the Q&A.
43 That's not—[sigh] okay fine, maybe I could've been more explicit about it, but honestly? You weren't even gonna present. You said you didn't wanna do the talking part.
44 I didn't erase you! God, you're making it sound like I'm this—this horrible person who planned this whole thing. It was a mistake, okay? A stupid formatting thing that I—yeah, I should've fixed it, but I didn't think—
45 No! That's not—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. [frustrated laugh] I didn't think it was that big a deal because we both know what we contributed. I did like seventy percent of that project anyway.
46 Yeah, kinda? I mean—look, I'm not saying you didn't help, obviously you did, but I pulled three all-nighters finishing that thing while you were—whatever, that's not the point.
47 While you were dealing with your other stuff! Which is fine, I'm not—I'm not blaming you for having other priorities, but don't act like we split this fifty-fifty when you know that's not true.
48 And I used it! I turned it into an actual presentation, I made all the slides, I practiced for hours—I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry your name wasn't on the title slide, but honestly? I think I deserved the credit I got.
49 That's not what I—[groan] come on, you know that's not what I meant. I'm trying to apologize here but you're not even—you won't even acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, I had reasons for how things went down.
50 Fine. Fine fine, you're right, I screwed up. But y'know what? I'm kinda disappointed too, because I thought—I thought you'd at least try to understand where I was coming from instead of just... this.
51 [panicked shout] The hull breach—it's in section seven! [breathing heavily] Water's coming in fast, we need to seal it now! [voice cracking] Get the emergency kit before we lose power to the whole compartment!
52 [strained grunt] It won't budge! [voice rising] The hydraulics must be damaged from the impact. [Choking cough] Help me with this valve—if we can redirect the ballast, maybe we can equalize the pressure somehow!
53 [hoarse whisper] The escape trunk's above the breach. [louder and frantic] Can't you hear that groaning? The metal's buckling! [Whimpering] We're trapped between the water and a sealed hatch—think of something else, quick!
54 [through gritted teeth] The console's shorting out—sparks everywhere! [defeated tone] Half the systems are already dead. [Bitter laugh] So much for state-of-the-art equipment. Wait—the auxiliary pump, is it still operational down here?
55 [weakly] Too narrow with the emergency gear on. [more resolved] Listen, one of us needs to dive under, open that hatch. [quiet determination] I'll do it—you keep trying the radio, maybe someone heard our last transmission.
56 [exhausted] The duct's our only shot, but we'll have to swim to reach it now. [firmly] Drop everything that weighs you down. [Shuddering breath] On three, we go together—the water's rising faster, almost at our chests!
57 [commanding tone] Focus on my voice, don't think about the dark! [reassuring] I've got your shoulder, we're moving together. [Coughing sputter] The duct should be two meters ahead—keep your hand on the wall, feel for it!
58 [echoing from duct] I'm through—reaching back for you now! [desperately loud] Grab my hand! [more strained] You're heavier than—no, don't let go! Push with your legs against the wall, I've almost got you up here!
59 [hopeful] There's light ahead—actual light! [voice breaking] It's the engineering bay access panel! [Nervous laugh] Twenty more meters of crawling and we're out—unless this section's flooded too, but I hear voices down there!
60 [dazed mumble] My ears won't stop ringing. [gradually steadier] That was too close—thirty more seconds and we'd have drowned. [Heavy exhale] The Captain's going to want answers about how we missed that initial breach warning.
61 [confused] Excuse me, um, I'm trying to use this AR thing on my phone but—[frustrated sigh]—nothing's happening when I point it at product SKU-4478B. [hesitantly] Is there like a specific angle I need or something?
62 [relieved] Oh wait, yeah, there's a frame now! [excitedly] But it keeps saying "calibration needed" and—[groans]—the percentage just stuck at 47%. Should I try moving to aisle 12-B instead where the lighting's better?
63 [amazed] Whoa, it just—it worked! [laughs nervously] I can see the sofa in my living room now, but um, the color looks weird? [puzzled tone] Like it's showing beige but the tag says item color BLU-445?
64 [frustrated groan] Now the whole thing crashed and there's an error—[reading slowly] "Exception at memory address 0x7B4A." [sarcastically] Super helpful, right? My session ID was, uh, let me check... AS-99412-K if that matters?
65 [skeptically] Okay, it's back up but—[surprised gasp]—wow, there's like twenty different furniture pieces floating everywhere! [bewildered] Is this supposed to happen with multi-scan batch MRX-200, or did I break something at coordinates 41.2, -73.8?
66 [professionally] Good afternoon, this is Sarah from PowerGrid Utilities, how can I assist you today? [warmly] I see you're calling from the account registered to—let me just pull that up for you.
67 [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, sir, and I'm—I'm truly sorry about this ongoing issue. [quickly] Let me check your account history right away to see what's been happening with those meter readings.
68 [more reassuringly] Sir, I can see the pattern here and—yes, you're absolutely right, this shouldn't have gone on this long. [briskly] I'm escalating this immediately to our field service team, and here's what we'll do differently this time.
69 [decisively] Right, so—listen, I'm scheduling a priority appointment for tomorrow between 8 and 12. [faster] The technician will call you thirty minutes before arrival, and if they can't access it, they'll need to document exactly why with photos.
70 [quickly] Absolutely, once we get the actual reading, we'll do a full reconciliation going back four months. [confidently] Any overcharges will be credited to your account immediately, or—or we can issue a refund check if you prefer.
71 [efficiently] Already typing it up as we speak—you'll have that confirmation email within five minutes. [reassuringly] It'll include my direct extension, case number 78432, and the service manager's contact as backup.
72 [understanding] That's completely fair, and honestly, you have every right to do that. [more quietly] Between us, sometimes that's what it takes to get things moving properly around here.
73 [with slight humor] I prefer to call it... external motivation. [briskly] But seriously, I've flagged this as critical, and I'll personally follow up tomorrow afternoon to confirm everything went smoothly.
74 [confidently] You won't need to, I promise you that. [quickly] I'm also adding a note for monthly manual reads for the next three months, just to ensure this never happens again.
75 [warmly] Thank you, sir—I've been doing this for eight years, and trust me, I've seen it all. [reassuringly] Your email confirmation just went through; check your inbox and let me know if you need anything else.
76 [Slow] Good evening everyone, I'm so honored to be—wait, no, that's too formal. [Tsk] Let me try that again with, like, more energy.
77 [Happy] Okay, this is it, you've got this! [Fast] Just remember to breathe, make eye contact, and don't forget the joke about the chicken!
78 [Whisper] Why did I agree to do this? [Sigh] I mean, honestly, I could just call in sick tomorrow and nobody would even—no, stop it.
79 [Angry] The statistics clearly show that we're—ugh, I sound like a robot! [Groan] Nobody wants to hear numbers for twenty minutes straight!
80 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's open with a quote from Gandhi, because that's never been done before. [Chuckle] Really groundbreaking stuff there, genius.
81 [Disappointed] I've been practicing for three weeks and I still can't get through the middle part without, um, completely blanking out. [Sigh]
82 [Fast] [Happy] And that's when everything changed—boom! [Laugh] See, I told you this story would blow your minds, right?
83 [Slow] In conclusion... [Tsk] No wait, that sounds like I'm wrapping up a high school essay or something.
84 [Shout] Ladies and gentlemen! [Happy] Welcome to—actually is that too loud? I don't wanna, like, scare people right off the bat.
85 [Sad] [Whisper] What if I just completely freeze up there and everyone's staring at me and I can't even remember my own name?
86 [Fast] Um, so basically what I'm trying to say is—no, that's too wishy-washy. [Angry] Just get to the point already!
87 [Chuckle] You know what, forget the notecards. [Happy] I'm just gonna wing it and see what happens, I mean, how bad could it really go?
88 [Disappointed] This tie makes me look like I'm going to a funeral, doesn't it? [Sigh] Great, now I gotta figure out what else to wear.
89 [Slow] [Sarcastic] Thank you sooo much for this incredible opportunity to speak about quarterly revenue projections. [Tsk] Thrilling stuff, truly.
90 [Whisper] [Sad] Remember when you used to be good at this? When you could just, like, talk to people without your hands shaking?
91 [Happy] Oh man, they're gonna love the part where I talk about the—wait, did I remember to print the handouts? [Groan] [Fast] Please tell me I printed them!
92 [Angry] Stop saying "um" every five seconds! [Disappointed] It's literally the one thing the coach told you not to do, and here you are, um—dammit!
93 [Slow] Before we begin, I'd like to acknowledge... [Chuckle] Nah, that sounds way too presidential for a sales presentation, doesn't it?
94 [Shout] [Happy] Yes! Nailed that transition! [Laugh] Finally got from point A to point B without sounding like a complete disaster!
95 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, compare yourself to Steve Jobs, that's not pretentious at all—I mean, you're basically the same person, right? [Tsk]
96 Wait wait wait—you WON? Like, the whole thing? The—oh my god, the competition? That's literally incredible! I mean, I knew you were working on it but—wow!
97 Best in—okay, okay, I'm gonna need you to like, actually tell me stuff here because this is huge! How many people were there? Was it like, super competitive? [Gasp] Did you get a trophy?
98 Five HUNDRED—sorry, what? That's actually insane! You've been sewing for like, what, two years? And you just beat people who've probably been doing this forever?
99 Right right, three—still though! I remember when you couldn't even thread that machine thingy. Now you're literally winning conventions. Are you, like... happy about it? You seem kinda flat.
100 Weird how? Like, weird that you won or weird that—actually, y'know what? I get it. Sometimes when something big happens it's like... your brain doesn't know what to do with it. [Chuckle]
101 Oh god, that's—yeah, that's a lot of people-ing. Especially for you. But like, they probably just thought you looked amazing! Which, I mean, obviously you did if you won the whole thing.
102 Those platform boots! I told you—I literally said those things were gonna kill you. But no no no, you were all about "accuracy" and "screen-accurate proportions" or whatever.
103 See! There—there it is! [Laugh] You ARE happy about it! You're just being all... you about it. Did anyone you know see you win?
104 Oh. Oh no. Wait—actually, that's kinda perfect though? Like, ultimate revenge is just... being incredible at something while they watch? How'd that feel?
105 Okay that's—that's the best thing you've said all day. You know what? We're celebrating. I don't care if you're tired, we're getting takeout and you're gonna show me every single photo from today.
106 Oh—um, what comments? I mean, I'm not sure what you're—wait, are you upset with me? Because if I said something wrong, I honestly didn't mean to.
107 Okay okay, maybe I—I might have an idea? But like, I wasn't trying to be mean or anything, I swear. Sometimes I just say things without thinking and—god, that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.
108 Oh. Oh no. [nervous laugh] Those weren't—I didn't mean them like that. I was just, y'know, making conversation? But hearing them back like that... yeah, that's pretty bad, isn't it?
109 I know, I know, you're right. It's like—I dunno why I do it? Maybe I'm jealous or insecure or something and it just comes out all wrong. That's not an excuse though, I'm just trying to—I'm trying to understand why I keep doing this.
110 God, I'm so sorry. I really—[sigh]—I really am. You're one of my best friends and I've been acting like such a jerk without even realizing it. Or maybe I did realize it? I don't even know anymore.
111 No no no, that's not—you're amazing, okay? You literally are. I think maybe I'm just... projecting my own stuff onto you? Which is so messed up and I gotta stop doing that immediately.
112 Because I'm an idiot? Because I didn't even realize I was—actually no, that's a cop-out. I think I was scared to admit I was feeling jealous about stupid things. Like your promotion and your new relationship and just... everything going well for you.
113 Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I did. And it's—it's toxic and horrible and I hate that I became that person. You deserve so much better than that from me, honestly.
114 Me too. I mean—I wanna be that friend again. The one who actually celebrates your wins instead of making snide comments about them. [quieter] Can we—can we try to fix this? I promise I'll work on it.
115 I will. I promise I will. And if I slip up—which hopefully I won't but if I do—please just call me out immediately? Don't let it build up like this again. I never wanna hurt you like this again.
116 [stern] Let's discuss your performance this quarter. [clearing throat] Your reports have been consistently late, and [slower] I've noticed several errors in the budget projections. [pause] This isn't the standard we expect from someone in your position.
117 [impatiently] Everyone has the same workload here. [sharp exhale] Your colleagues manage to meet their deadlines without issue. [more forcefully] Perhaps you need to reconsider your time management strategies or whether this role suits you.
118 [dismissively] Excuses won't fix missed deadlines. [louder] The Henderson account specifically complained about your responsiveness. [sigh] How do you explain taking three days to return their calls when our policy is twenty-four hours?
119 [sarcastically] Oh, accuracy matters? [bitter laugh] Then explain the calculation errors in last week's presentation. [slower, deliberate] The CEO noticed them immediately. Do you know how that reflects on our entire department?
120 [uncomfortable pause] Personal issues can't interfere with work performance. [gentler] While I sympathize with your situation, [returning to stern] we need reliability. [firmly] Your improvement plan starts Monday—non-negotiable.
121 [coldly] Past performance doesn't erase current failures. [measured tone] You have thirty days to show measurable improvement. [pause] Meet the metrics outlined in the plan, [warning tone] or we'll need to explore other options.
122 [skeptically] That's the attitude I need to see. [rustling papers vocally] But actions speak louder than words. [businesslike] HR will send the documentation by end of day. [curtly] We'll meet weekly to track progress.
123 [sighing heavily] Your client relationships, when you maintain them, are strong. [reluctantly] People do seem to like working with you. [quickly] But likability doesn't replace competence. [firm] Focus on the metrics, not making friends.
124 [warning tone] See that you don't. [abruptly] Your first deadline is Wednesday's report. [emphasis] No extensions, no excuses. [lighter] Prove to me that keeping you was the right decision.
125 [surprised] That would be a welcome change. [professionally] Remember, this isn't personal—it's business. [softer briefly] I actually want you to succeed here. [returning firm] But wanting isn't enough without results.
126 [concerned] Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry to hear about this situation, let me pull up your reservation immediately. [apologetically] Can you please confirm your last name and confirmation number? [reassuring] We take these matters very seriously and I'll get our manager involved right away.
127 [sympathetically] Mr. Henderson, I completely understand your frustration, this is truly awful. [more urgently] I'm immediately moving you to our premium suite 812, and we'll have housekeeping collect your belongings for professional treatment. [sincerely] Would you like us to arrange medical attention for those bites?
128 [calmly] Sir, I'm authorizing a complete refund to your card ending in 4892. [professionally] Additionally, we'll cover dry cleaning and replacement costs up to $1,500 with proper receipts. [more softly] Our general manager, Ms. Rodriguez, will personally meet you in fifteen minutes to discuss further compensation.
129 [firmly] We've already initiated our emergency protocol and pest control arrives at 6 AM. [reassuringly] All adjacent rooms are being inspected and relocated as we speak—that's twelve rooms total. [apologetic] I know this doesn't undo your experience, but we're treating this as our highest priority incident.
130 [steadily] Absolutely, I'm documenting everything in incident report TX-20241122-BUG-347. [helpfully] Corporate's complaint line is 1-800-555-8200, case reference number will be HC8829M. [more warmly] I'm also personally ensuring you receive email confirmation within ten minutes to JHenderson at gmail dot com, correct?
131 [briskly] Tech support, this is Jordan speaking, how can I help you today? [more cheerfully] I see you're calling about an update issue—let me pull up your account real quick.
132 [sympathetically] Oh, that's incredibly frustrating, I completely understand. [quickly] Let's get this sorted right away—first, can you tell me, um, which version you're currently running? [more urgently] Should be under Settings, then About.
133 [reassuringly] Okay, okay, we'll definitely get this fixed before then. [rapidly] Here's what we're gonna do—I'm seeing a known issue with that specific build that affects, uh, about twelve percent of users. [more confidently] There's a workaround though.
134 [patiently] No worries at all, I get it—technology can be maddening sometimes. [quickly] So first, you'll need to boot into safe mode, then—this is important—disable the security suite temporarily. [more slowly] I'll walk you through each step.
135 [briskly] Absolutely! Power completely off first, then hold volume down while pressing power. [more deliberately] Keep holding until you see the logo appear twice—not once, twice—that's the tricky part most people miss.
136 [enthusiastically] Perfect! You're doing great. [rapidly] Now navigate to Settings, Security, and toggle off the enhanced protection—just temporarily. [more carefully] After that, retry the update from the beginning.
137 [encouragingly] Excellent, that's exactly what should happen! [quickly] While that's running, let me just document this issue for our development team—they really need to push a proper fix. [more firmly] This shouldn't be happening to customers.
138 [relieved chuckle] Sometimes it's the smallest things that cause the biggest headaches. [briskly] Once it completes, you can re-enable security—the conflict only happens during installation, not after.
139 [warmly] Hey, that's what we're here for! [quickly] Just remember for future updates—if you hit that same wall, try the safe mode trick first. [more casually] Saves everyone time and frustration.
140 [confidently] Actually, yes—the fix is already in beta testing. [rapidly] Version nine point zero should roll out within two weeks, and it completely eliminates this compatibility issue. [reassuringly] Your future updates should be smooth sailing.
141 [Sad] I just, um, I've seen what happens when people promise forever and then—then everything falls apart, you know? [Sigh]
142 [Fast] Okay so basically every time I get close to someone they either leave or I mess it up somehow and I can't—I just can't do that again. [Tsk]
143 [Whisper] What if I wake up one day and realize I made the wrong choice? [Slow] That terrifies me more than being alone, honestly.
144 [Angry] You don't get it—my parents stayed together "for the kids" and it was a disaster, okay? [Groan] I'm not repeating that.
145 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just sign up for potentially losing half my stuff and my sanity. [Laugh] That sounds like a great time.
146 [Happy] I mean, I'm actually really good at being single—like, I've got my routine, my space, everything's perfect! [Chuckle] Why would I wanna mess that up?
147 [Disappointed] Every wedding I go to, I just think about how, um, how fifty percent of these people are gonna be divorced in five years. [Sigh]
148 [Slow] The thing is—wait, how do I explain this—I literally don't know who I'll be in ten years. [Sad] How can I promise someone that person?
149 [Shout] I'm twenty-eight, not eighty-eight! [Angry] Stop acting like I'm running out of time or something!
150 [Fast] My therapist says it's because of my "attachment style" or whatever but honestly I think some people just aren't meant for the whole commitment thing, right? [Tsk]
151 [Whisper] Sometimes I look at couples and they seem so... trapped. [Disappointed] Like they're just going through the motions, y'know?
152 [Sarcastic] Yeah, 'cause nothing says "romance" like arguing about whose turn it is to clean the bathroom. [Chuckle] [Fast] I'll pass, thanks.
153 [Sad] I had this friend who completely changed after she got married—like, she became this whole different person and I just... [Sigh] I don't wanna lose myself.
154 [Happy] But seriously, have you seen how much weddings cost these days? [Laugh] I could travel the world for a year with that money!
155 [Angry] Look, I tried the whole serious relationship thing once and it was—god, it was suffocating, okay? [Slow] I couldn't breathe.
156 [Disappointed] My last relationship started out amazing and then it just, um, it kinda slowly turned into this obligation. [Tsk] [Sad] That's not love.
157 [Fast] What if they cheat, what if I cheat, what if we get bored, what if—there's just too many what-ifs! [Groan]
158 [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm supposed to believe that this one person is gonna fulfill all my needs forever? [Slow] That's, uh, that's quite the job description.
159 [Whisper] Honestly? [Sad] I think I'm more afraid of hurting someone else than getting hurt myself—like, what if I can't be what they need?
160 [Happy] You know what, being commitment-phobic keeps things exciting! [Chuckle] [Fast] Every date could be the last one, so they're all kinda special, right?
161 Oh god, you saw that? I—okay, wait wait wait, let me explain. It's not what it looks like, I swear. The venue changed and they said we had to cut the list down and I—I didn't know what to do.
162 No! No no no, that's not—I mean, technically yes, but it wasn't like that. [nervous laugh] My cousin suddenly decided she's bringing her entire wedding party and I had to make room and you said you weren't even sure if you could come, remember?
163 Right, yeah, and I—I totally misread that. I thought that meant you didn't really wanna go? Which is so stupid, I know. God, I'm such an idiot.
164 You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've—I was gonna text you but then I kept putting it off because I felt so awkward about it and then somehow it just... happened. [groan] I literally handled this in the worst possible way.
165 I'm sorry. Like, genuinely truly sorry. I've been feeling sick about it all week, honestly. Sarah told me you were upset and I—I wanted to call but I didn't know if you'd even pick up.
166 Fair. That's—that's totally fair. Um, but listen, I already talked to the venue and they said if we skip the cocktail hour we can add more people to dinner? So you're back on the list. If you still wanna come, I mean. Which you probably don't.
167 Yeah, it's—it's my engagement party. [quieter] Which makes it so much worse that I uninvited you, I know. You've been there for literally everything and I just... I panicked and made a really really dumb decision.
168 I know. God, I know. You were gonna be in the wedding party—you still are, if you don't hate me. Please don't hate me? I literally can't imagine doing any of this without you there.
169 That's almost worse, honestly. But I—I get it. I really messed up. Can I—would it help if I came over? I've got those cookies you like from that place downtown. I mean, I know cookies don't fix this but maybe we could talk?
170 Totally understandable. Still mad is—that's better than nothing, right? I'll be there in twenty. Actually, thirty—I gotta stop for the cookies. [sigh] Thank you for even talking to me. I really don't deserve it.
171 Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like the actual, the actual funding you've been working on for months?
172 Two point—holy shit. [Laugh] Sorry, I just—that's incredible! I mean, I knew you were gonna get it, but like, hearing it actually happened? That's... wow.
173 Okay but like—how are you feeling? Because you seem kinda... I dunno, subdued? For someone who just became a funded founder? That's huge, babe.
174 Oh no no no, that's—yeah, that makes sense actually. You're probably running on like, pure adrenaline right now. When do you get to, y'know, actually celebrate?
175 Five engin—okay, um, that's aggressive. But like, you've got the money now, right? So that's gotta make it easier to attract talent at least?
176 [Chuckle] A ping pong—of course they do. Tech people are so... but honestly? You're gonna build something amazing. I just, I really believe that.
177 Hey—no. Stop that. You didn't get two and a half million dollars by being someone who messes things up, okay? These investors, they're like, they're literally betting on you.
178 Oh babe... that's—I mean, that's totally normal though? Like, imposter syndrome is basically a requirement for founders, right? But you've got this. You've always had this.
179 Wait, they think you're—[Groan] oh my god, that's so typical. But like, when you're on the cover of TechCrunch or whatever, they'll get it. Trust me.
180 Okay okay, so—here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna order really expensive champagne, even if you can only have like one sip before passing out, and we're gonna toast to your success. Because this is—this is everything you've worked for, y'know?
181 Wait wait wait—you WHAT? Oh my god, are you serious right now? I didn't even know you were gonna actually do it! That's—that's incredible!
182 A trophy? Like an actual— [Gasp] okay no, I need details. What did you sing? Because honestly, I'm still processing that you even went up there.
183 You did NOT. That's like—that's literally the hardest karaoke song ever! All those parts? The opera bit? How did you even—I mean, were people losing their minds?
184 [Laugh] Stop it, that's—okay that's actually hilarious. But like, you must've been so good that random drunk people wanted in on your moment! Were you nervous at all?
185 Oh babe, no—but you still went through with it? That's... honestly that's kinda badass. Like, most people would've just gone home, y'know?
186 FIVE HUNDRED—okay okay, buried the lead much? What are you gonna do with it? Please tell me you're gonna celebrate or something because this is huge!
187 Tires? Are you—no no no, you literally just became a karaoke champion and you wanna buy tires? [Groan] You're killing me here. At least get like, one fun thing?
188 It LIGHTS UP? Okay wait—I need to see this immediately. Can you, like, bring it next time? Or send a video? Because that sounds absolutely ridiculous and I'm obsessed.
189 In your—oh my god, of course it is. You win your first competition ever and just... shove it in storage? That's so perfectly you, I can't even be mad about it.
190 Um, excuse me? You're gonna—okay yes, absolutely yes. I'm coming to that one, no arguments. Someone needs to document your reign of karaoke terror, and apparently [Laugh] that someone's gonna be me.
191 Oh my god, wait—how'd it go? I've been like, literally thinking about this all week because you were so stressed about it, remember?
192 Shut up. Shut—are you serious? That's like... nobody gets perfect scores! That's actually— [Gasp] oh my god, I'm so proud of you!
193 Weird? What do you—okay, hold on. You just got a perfect review and you're calling it weird? That's not weird, that's incredible!
194 No no no, stop that right now. They didn't—companies don't just accidentally give perfect reviews, y'know? Like, that's not how it works. You earned this.
195 Okay, um, can we just—let's pause for a second here because you're kinda [Sigh] doing that thing where you can't accept good news? This is huge!
196 Fine? It's—babe, this is so much more than fine! Did they say anything specific? Like, what made them give you perfect scores?
197 That's not—okay that's not just corporate speak though. They literally called you exceptional! That means something, right? Like, they see what you're doing.
198 Yeah, I mean, I get that. It's probably like—when good things happen sometimes it's harder to believe than the bad stuff? [Chuckle] Which is so backwards but totally normal.
199 There's no catch! This is just—this is you being really, really good at your job and finally, finally getting recognized for it, y'know?
200 Wait wait wait—they what? You buried the lead! That's—okay we're gonna celebrate. Like, actually celebrate. No arguments, we're getting drinks tonight!
201 Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? I thought you were— [Gasp] oh my god, are you serious right now?
202 Okay so like, which show? Because if it's the one where you have to eat weird stuff, I'm gonna—actually no, I'd still watch that. But seriously, which one?
203 Stop it. Stop—that's the one with the crazy host who like, makes everyone do those ridiculous dances? You're gonna be on TV doing that?
204 No no no, this is—this is amazing! When do you film? Do you get to bring anyone? Because I will literally [Laugh] call in sick to work, I don't even care.
205 Okay um, not to be presumptuous but like—I mean, I'm basically already planning my outfit? Unless you're taking someone else which is, y'know, totally fine, I guess.
206 If I—are you kidding me right now? I'm gonna be the most obnoxious person in that audience. Like, embarrassingly supportive. You know that, right?
207 But seriously though, like—how are you feeling about it? Because I know you're being all casual but this is kinda huge, you know? [Sigh] You nervous?
208 Oh babe, yeah, that's—okay but here's the thing though. Once you're up there, you're just gonna focus on the questions and like, forget everyone else exists. That's how it works.
209 You won't—you won't freeze, okay? And even if you do, which you won't, but like—so what? At least you tried something scary, y'know? That's honestly pretty badass.
210 Hey, no—listen. Whatever you decide is totally, totally fine. But like, can you imagine watching yourself win all that money? Just—just think about it, okay? No pressure though.
211 SCENARIO: trying to remember what they came into the room for
212 [squealing] Oh my GOD, Emma, look at this lace! [breathless] Mom actually wore this walking down the aisle to Dad. [in awe] Can you believe how tiny her waist was back then—like, seriously, how did she even breathe in this thing?
213 [whispering reverently] Feel this fabric though. [louder] It's so heavy and luxurious, nothing like wedding dresses today. [nostalgic tone] Remember when we used to play dress-up with her shoes and pretend we were getting married to our stuffed animals?
214 [hushed excitement] Stop wiggling or you'll rip it! [more urgently] Mom would absolutely murder us if we damaged this. [Nervous laugh] Though honestly, seeing you in this is worth risking her wrath—you look exactly like her old photos.
215 [Snorting laugh] Your face right now! [teasing] You're already planning your own wedding, aren't you? [softer] But seriously, we should take photos before Mom gets home—she'll cry happy tears seeing us appreciating her dress like this.
216 [straining] Pull your stomach in more! [triumphant] There, got it! [in amazement] Oh wow, Emma, you're literally glowing in this dress—like some kind of vintage princess who time-traveled here from nineteen-eighty-five to blow our minds.
217 [mock serious] We need the full experience though. [increasingly giddy] Where are those white gloves she had? [Cackle] And the blue garter—we saw it in the box somewhere, this is our chance to recreate the whole look!
218 [frustrated] These buttons are impossible! [getting frantic] Why did people in the eighties make everything so complicated? [Nervous giggle] She's definitely coming up the driveway—we have like thirty seconds to perform a miracle here, Emma!
219 [relieved exhale] False alarm—it's just the neighbors. [calmer] We have time to do this properly. [gently] Here, stand still and let me work on these buttons systematically instead of panicking like crazy people.
220 [tenderly] I know exactly what you mean. [thoughtful pause] She was our age when she wore this. [getting excited again] Hey, what if we surprised her by getting it professionally photographed—like a tribute to her wedding photos?
221 [determined] Let's do it next weekend then. [getting faster] We'll need the shoes, the jewelry, everything. [Excited whisper] And we won't tell her until we give her the framed photos—she'll absolutely lose it in the best way.
222 [apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir, and I'm truly sorry about the inconvenience. [more gently] The cancellation was due to, um, unforeseen circumstances with the artist's health, and we sent notifications to all ticket holders at their registered emails yesterday at 3:47 PM.
223 [calmly] Unfortunately, the artist won't be able to perform for the next several months, so rescheduling isn't possible. [more reassuringly] However, we are offering full refunds plus a 20% discount code—that's VEN20COMP—for any future show at our venue within the next year.
224 [sympathetically] I truly understand this is disappointing, especially for such a special occasion. [more helpfully] While we can't cover hotel costs, if you provide your member ID—do you have our venue membership?—I might be able to offer additional compensation options.
225 [brightening slightly] Oh, gold membership! That actually qualifies you for our premium compensation package. [more enthusiastically] You'll receive two complimentary tickets to any show in the next 18 months, plus priority booking access code PAX1122 for all upcoming events.
226 [professionally] Let me check what else I can do... your account shows you've attended 14 shows with us. [more confidently] I'm authorized to upgrade those complimentary tickets to our VIP package, which includes parking, drinks, and guaranteed seats in rows A through F.
227 [helpfully] Actually, yes! The Jazz Club at 776 Broadway has availability tonight, and they honor our venue partnerships. [more eagerly] If you show them your ticket confirmation B7X429K and mention code TRANSFER23, they'll give you equivalent seating at no charge.
228 [warmly] Perfect! They have a wonderful young artists showcase tonight starting at 8:30 PM. [more informatively] I'll email you the details now to your registered address, and I've also added a $50 dining credit—code DINE50VIP—for their restaurant, which should cover appetizers and desserts.
229 [understandingly] No apology necessary, sir—I'm a parent too, and I know how important these moments are. [cheerfully] I've processed your full refund of $236.80, which should appear in account ending 4429 within 3-5 business days, along with all the compensation codes.
230 [enthusiastically] Oh, you'll love this—we have The Mercury Band on February 15th, and ticket sales open Monday at noon! [conspiratorially] With your priority code, you can actually access them Sunday at 10 AM, and VIP packages start at just $89 with your member discount.
231 [delighted] Absolutely! I've set a reminder in your account and you'll receive an email alert 24 hours before your priority access begins. [warmly] Enjoy the Jazz Club tonight, Mr. Johnson, and happy 16th birthday to your daughter—I hope she has a wonderful evening despite the change of plans!
232 [professionally] Thank you for contacting us about your rate increase concern. [quickly] I see here that your premium went from $145 to $218 monthly, which is—uh—quite a jump. [more gently] Let me pull up your account details to investigate this for you.
233 [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, and eight years is certainly valued loyalty. [briskly] Looking at your file, I see there were actually two factors here—your zip code had multiple claims last quarter, and, well, state regulations changed. [more carefully] Neither are your fault, of course.
234 [quickly] Actually, yes, let me check what discounts we can apply. [more enthusiastically] Have you—um—installed any anti-theft devices recently, or completed a defensive driving course? [reassuringly] Sometimes these small things can knock off fifteen to twenty percent.
235 [hurriedly] Right, I see those are already applied, my apologies for not noticing. [thoughtfully] Let me escalate this to my supervisor—she has more authority to review special circumstances. [more firmly] Can you hold for just two to three minutes while I explain your situation?
236 [apologetically] No, no, I promise I'll stay on the line with you. [more quickly] Actually, wait—I'm seeing something here about bundling options. [interested] Do you currently have homeowner's or renter's insurance through us or elsewhere?
237 [quickly] No sales pitch, I promise, just math actually. [more energetically] If you bundle, we could potentially reduce your auto rate by twenty-five percent, which would bring you down to about $163. [carefully] That's still higher than before, but significantly better than $218.
238 [briskly] Actually, we're running a promotion where new home policies get twelve months locked at competitive rates. [confidently] Based on your address, you'd likely save about forty dollars monthly overall between both policies. [more quietly] The bundling discount applies to both, you see.
239 [professionally] Absolutely, I'm generating a detailed quote right now. [typing quickly] It'll be in your email within five minutes, showing side-by-side comparisons. [reassuringly] No obligation to switch, just—uh—take your time reviewing it.
240 [understanding] Oh believe me, I get it—I'm a customer too, different company, but same frustrations. [more quickly] The quote should include everything: deductibles, coverage limits, and any applicable discounts. [helpfully] There's also a grace period if you need to coordinate canceling with State Farm.
241 [quickly] No lock-in period after the first year, you can adjust or cancel anytime with thirty days notice. [more reassuringly] Plus, bundled customers get rate protection—increases are capped at five percent annually. [confidently] That's actually one of our better features.
242 [Slow] Okay so, um, basically it's this picture of a dog, but like—wait, let me pull it up on my phone first. [Chuckle]
243 [Fast] No, no, Grandma, you don't actually have to do anything, it's just, uh, it's meant to be funny because everyone relates to it! [Laugh]
244 [Sarcastic] Yeah, I know it doesn't seem funny when I explain it like this. [Sigh] The magic kinda dies, y'know?
245 [Whisper] Grandpa's pretending to get it but I can tell he's completely lost. [Tsk] Should I just give up?
246 [Happy] Wait, you actually laughed at that one! [Laugh] [Fast] See, I knew you'd understand the cat ones better!
247 [Disappointed] I mean, it's supposed to be ironic, which is like—honestly, I dunno how to explain irony without sounding pretentious. [Groan]
248 [Angry] It's not stupid, it's just—you gotta understand the context from, like, three other memes that came before this one! [Tsk]
249 [Slow] So there's this thing called a "format" where everyone uses the same picture but changes the words? [Sigh]
250 [Shout] No, you're not supposed to email it to anyone! [Fast] [Laugh] That would be so cringe—I mean, embarrassing!
251 [Happy] You know what, forget the technical stuff—it's basically just young people making jokes about being tired and broke. [Chuckle]
252 [Sad] I guess it's kinda depressing when you think about it, but we laugh so we don't, um, cry? [Slow] [Sigh]
253 [Fast] Okay so remember that TV commercial from the 80s you mentioned? [Happy] It's literally the same concept except we screenshot it!
254 [Whisper] [Disappointed] Maybe I should've started with something easier than deep-fried surrealist memes. [Tsk]
255 [Sarcastic] Sure, Grandma, it's exactly like the funny pages in the newspaper. [Chuckle] If the newspaper was having an existential crisis.
256 [Angry] [Fast] I'm not making fun of you—I just, it's hard to translate internet humor into, er, real world language!
257 [Happy] Actually, you know what, your confused face right now would make a perfect meme template! [Laugh] [Fast] Can I take a picture?
258 [Slow] [Sad] Sometimes they're not even supposed to make sense, which I realize sounds, um, kinda dumb out loud.
259 [Disappointed] [Sigh] The algorithm decides what's funny now, which is—yeah, I can't defend that actually.
260 [Shout] That's it! [Happy] You got it! That's exactly what the meme means—see, you're basically fluent in internet now!
261 [Whisper] Honestly, half the time I don't get them either, but I just, like, nervously laugh and keep scrolling. [Chuckle] [Tsk]
262 SCENARIO: Frustrated about a rainy wedding, then the venue looks magical with the rain
263 Wait, WHAT? Oh my god—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like, it actually came through? This is—[Gasp] I'm literally gonna cry, this is huge!
264 Ten years. Ten. Holy—okay, okay, we need to like, we gotta celebrate or something. How are you so calm about this? I'd be, I dunno, screaming from the rooftops or whatever.
265 No no no, that's—that's totally fair actually. It's probably like... overwhelming, right? After waiting for so long and dealing with all that bureaucratic nightmare stuff?
266 Ugh, don't even—the system is so messed up, honestly. But hey, you did it. You actually [Chuckle] you actually did it. Can you like, travel now? See your family?
267 Oh man, your mom's gonna—she's gonna lose it, right? How long has it been since you've seen them? Like three years?
268 Four years. Jesus. That's—I can't even imagine, y'know? Not being able to just... go home when you want to.
269 [Sigh] Babe, that's... god, I'm so sorry. That must've been—I mean, being stuck here while life just kept happening over there? That's brutal.
270 Yeah but like—it's okay to be angry about it, you know? Or sad or... whatever you're feeling. This whole thing, it's been like, basically your entire twenties, right?
271 And now you're—wait wait, you're thirty-three now? So literally a decade of just... waiting? Of not knowing if you could stay or had to leave?
272 Um, yes? Obviously yes! But also—hold on, we're not done talking about this. This is like, this is literally life-changing stuff and you're just... [Laugh] okay fine, we can talk over food. But I'm getting champagne. Non-negotiable.
273 Wait wait wait—the one you applied to? The super competitive one with like, I dunno, five spots or whatever? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
274 I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is actually [Gasp] insane. How are you so calm about this? I'd be bouncing off the walls!
275 No no no, I get it, I totally get it. It's like—when something this big happens, your brain just kinda... freezes up, right? But holy shit, you actually did it.
276 Okay, um, absolutely not. We're not—we're not doing the humble thing right now. You worked your ass off for this. Remember all those late nights you were basically living on coffee?
277 Sure, but like—okay yeah, everyone worked hard, but you got in. [Chuckle] That means something, y'know? Have you told your parents yet?
278 Oh man, they're gonna flip. Your mom's gonna—actually, she's probably gonna cry. Like, happy tears obviously, but still. Are you excited at all or just... terrified?
279 Yeah, I bet you're just—emotionally exhausted, right? All that waiting and wondering and now it's like... boom, it's real. When do you start?
280 September's gonna come so fast though. Oh my god, we gotta celebrate! Like, properly celebrate—not just grabbing coffee or whatever. This is literally life-changing stuff.
281 Just school? [Laugh] Babe, this program is like—people would kill to get in. You beat out hundreds of people. That's not "just" anything, that's incredible.
282 Okay okay, I know you're being all cautious and whatever, but like—can you at least admit you're a tiny bit proud? Because I'm so fucking proud of you I could scream.
283 Oh—um, okay. What's—what's going on? Did I do something? I mean, obviously I must've done something if you're looking at me like that, but I honestly don't know what—
284 No, I—wait, is this about yesterday? Or like, the thing at lunch? Because if it's about the comment I made about your presentation, I was trying to help! I thought—I thought you'd wanna know about the typo before—
285 Oh. Oh god. I didn't—[nervous laugh] okay, that's not—I wasn't trying to criticize you. I swear I wasn't. Those were just, like, observations? No wait, that sounds worse. I mean—
286 I'm—I'm realizing now how it must've seemed and I feel terrible. Like, genuinely awful. I thought I was being helpful? Y'know, like a good friend who points out stuff so you don't—but that's not—that's not what I was doing, was it. [Groan] God, I'm such an idiot.
287 No no no, that's not—there's nothing wrong with you! I just have this stupid habit where I, um, I notice things and then my mouth just—goes. Without thinking about how it sounds. My mom literally does the same thing to me and I hate it, so I don't—I don't know why I thought it was okay.
288 I know. I mean—I don't know know, but I can imagine. Actually, no, I do know because my mom—yeah. [Sigh] Look, I'm gonna work on it, okay? Like really work on it. I need to just... shut up sometimes. Most of the time, probably.
289 You don't—you never needed fixing! That's the thing, right? Like, you're already—you're great. The way you laugh? It's actually one of my favorite things about you. And talking fast just means you're excited about stuff, which is—that's awesome. I'm just an idiot who doesn't think before I speak.
290 I honestly didn't. Which I know sounds—I know that sounds so dumb, but I thought it was like, y'know, what friends do? But it's not. It's what jerks do. And I've been a jerk to you without even—without even realizing it, which almost makes it worse somehow.
291 I'm sorry. Like, really truly sorry. Not just—not just saying it, I mean it. I never wanted to make you feel bad about yourself. That's literally the last thing—you're one of my best friends and I've been making you feel awful. I gotta—I gotta be better. I will be better.
292 I will. I promise I will. No more—no more comments about anything unless you specifically ask for my opinion, which, honestly, you probably shouldn't because apparently I'm terrible at—sorry. Stopping now. [nervous laugh] But seriously, I'm gonna be so much more careful. You deserve better from me.
293 I know, I know how it looks but—okay, hear me out. It's not that I'm trying to make excuses, it's just that there's always these circumstances that—um, that make things more complicated than they seem, y'know?
294 No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, I guess I do say that a lot. But honestly, this time was different because my boss literally changed the deadline without telling me and I—wait, that's another excuse, isn't it? [nervous laugh] God, I'm doing it right now.
295 I just—I dunno why I do this. Like, I wanna take responsibility, I really do, but then my mouth just starts going and suddenly I'm explaining why it wasn't really my fault and—shit, you must be so sick of this.
296 Yeah. Yeah, you did. And I promised I'd stop and then I—[sigh] immediately went back to doing the exact same thing. That's... that's really messed up of me, actually.
297 I bet it is. I mean, I'm exhausting myself at this point, so I can't even imagine how you—wait wait, let me just say this: you're right. About all of it. I keep deflecting and making excuses and basically refusing to own up to anything.
298 I think I'm—okay this is gonna sound pathetic but I'm kinda terrified of people being disappointed in me? So I make these excuses to like, soften things? But that's just making everyone more disappointed in me, isn't it? [groan] God, I'm an idiot.
299 That's—that's fair. Really fair, actually. And you've been trying to tell me this for months and I just kept brushing it off with more excuses about why I make excuses, which is like, meta-level annoying.
300 I'm gonna—I mean, I want to work on this. For real this time, not just saying it to make you feel better. Would you maybe help me? Like, call me out when I start doing it?
301 No, you're right, you're totally right. Um, what I meant was—actually, y'know what? I'm gonna stop talking and just... actually follow through for once. Actions, not words, right?
302 It will. It will, I promise. And I know—I know my promises haven't meant much lately, but just... thanks for not giving up on me yet. Even though you probably should've.
303 Oh. Oh god, you saw that? I was just—she cornered me at the coffee shop and I didn't know what to do, so I just kinda... went with it? I know how it looked.
304 I know! I know I did, and she is—she totally is, but like... [nervous laugh] I can't just be rude to her face, y'know? That's not—I mean, what am I supposed to do, just ignore her?
305 Okay but—wait wait, that's so much harder than it sounds! You don't understand, she's friends with literally everyone at work and if I'm mean to her, it's gonna make my life hell.
306 No no no, that's—that's not fair. I'm not being fake, I'm being... professional? Civil? [sigh] Okay fine, maybe a little fake, but it's not like I'm inviting her to brunch or anything.
307 Oh my god, you heard that too? I was trying to—look, everyone else was saying nice things and I didn't wanna be the only one who didn't say anything, so I just... mumbled something vague about the color scheme.
308 I know. Trust me, it's exhausting to do too. But I don't—I honestly don't know how else to handle it. Like, I can't be the person who's just mean to people, even if they deserve it. That's not who I am.
309 That's... [groan] okay, that actually hurt. Because you're right. You're completely right and I hate it. I just—I get so anxious about confrontation that I end up doing this stupid performance instead.
310 What? No—oh my god, no no no. Never. I would never—you're my best friend, I don't talk about you like that. This is different, Madison's not—she's not you. She's not even really my friend, she's just... there.
311 Because I'm—okay, because I'm telling you the truth about her right now, aren't I? Like, I'm admitting she drives me crazy. I wouldn't do that if I was gonna turn around and be fake with you too. I know I'm a people-pleaser but I'm not—I'm not fake with the people who actually matter.
312 You're right. You're... totally right. I gotta stop doing this—it's not fair to anyone, honestly. Not to them, not to me, and definitely not to you. [nervous laugh] I'm sorry you had to watch me be such a coward. I'll try to—I'll do better. I promise.
313 SCENARIO: attempting to get a sticker off cleanly
314 [sharp tone] I just don't understand why you let Emma eat cookies before dinner. [getting louder] When you were little, we had rules—structure! [exasperated sigh] Now she's running around like a wild animal, and you just sit there smiling.
315 [scoffing] Healthy relationship? [bitter laugh] That's what you call letting a seven-year-old dictate meal times? In my day, children ate what they were given, when they were given it. [accusingly] No wonder she threw that tantrum at Thanksgiving.
316 [wounded] Never taught you? [voice rising] I sacrificed everything to raise you properly! [trembling] You had piano lessons, tutoring, the best schools. [bitterly] But apparently teaching you discipline and respect was where I failed miserably.
317 [mockingly] Oh yes, feelings—the answer to everything nowadays. [sharp laugh] When she can't handle real life because you've bubble-wrapped her emotions, don't come crying to me. [coldly] Mark my words, you're raising a snowflake who'll crumble at adversity.
318 [dismissive] Perfect? You were barely adequate! [frustrated groan] I had to push you because you were lazy, unfocused. [quieter] Without my guidance, you'd have amounted to nothing. And now you're repeating those mistakes with my granddaughter.
319 [venomously] Your fancy degree doesn't make you a good mother. [pause] [softer] I see how tired you look, how Emma manipulates you. You think being her friend is more important than being her parent. [urgent whisper] She needs boundaries, sweetheart.
320 [pleading tone] I'm only trying to help! [voice breaking] Every time I offer advice, you act like I'm attacking you. [sniffling] I raised three successful children, but suddenly my experience means nothing? Your sister agrees with me, you know.
321 [quietly dangerous] So that's what you think? That your siblings just tolerate me? [voice shaking] After everything I've done, all the love I've given? [louder] You ungrateful little—[sharp intake] No, I won't stoop to your level.
322 [defeated whisper] Be themselves. [bitter chuckle] That's rich, coming from someone who needed therapy for ten years to figure out who she was. [accusatory] But fine, raise Emma your way. [dramatically] I'll just watch from the sidelines.
323 [skeptical tone] Choices from love. [long pause] [reluctantly softer] I suppose we both want what's best for her, even if we disagree on methods. [strained] Maybe I could try to... hold my tongue more. [quickly] But only if you actually listen sometimes.
324 [frustrated] Look, I've been calling about this for weeks—my warranty number is RW-7829-JK, [getting louder] and now you're telling me it's void? [exasperated sigh] The leak at 4521 Oak Street started just two months after installation!
325 [outraged] Third-party work? [scoffs] Your own subcontractor came out here, invoice number INV-9982-B! He said the initial install was, was completely wrong, [desperately] missing underlayment on the entire north section!
326 [shouting] Random guy? [incredulous] He had your company van, license plate RFG-4421! [groans] How was I supposed to know he wasn't—look, just look at this damage spreading!
327 [sarcastically] Oh great, now you're quoting subsections at me. [getting angrier] My ceiling collapsed in bedroom three yesterday! [desperately] Insurance claim number CL-00567 is pending but they need your warranty confirmation!
328 [pleading] This is insane—I paid $18,500 for this premium package! [voice breaking] My kids can't even sleep upstairs anymore, and and you're worried about [bitterly] paperwork technicalities from paragraph whatever?
329 [defeated] So that's it? [voice rising again] Account number RF-2023-8847, perfect payment history, five star reviews—[chuckles bitterly] none of that matters because of one miscommunication?
330 [suspicious] Jenkins? [hopefully] Wait, are you saying he might actually help? [urgently] Because the adjuster comes Tuesday at 2 PM and I need—I really need something in writing!
331 [confused] Batch crews? [eagerly] We had crew 342 do our install—April 3rd! [gasps] Does that mean there's actually a known issue with those teams?
332 [determined] Right, okay, so Monday morning, Jenkins, extension 4429. [calculating] And I should reference crew 342 and the, the override protocols? [relieved sigh] This better work.
333 [grateful but frustrated] Fine, I'll try that route. [sarcastically] Though it's ridiculous that I need secret codes and [sighs] insider knowledge just to get my roof fixed properly!
334 [briskly] Doctor Miller's office, this is Sarah speaking, how can I help you today? [more quickly] We're quite busy this morning so—uh—please let me know what you need.
335 [apologetically] Oh, I see, let me just pull up your file here. [pause] What's your last name and date of birth please?
336 [concerned] Okay Mr. Johnson, I'm seeing here that—hmm—the refill request came in but [more quietly] it looks like your insurance requires a prior authorization for this particular medication now.
337 [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, these insurance changes are—well—they're ridiculous sometimes. [more firmly] Let me speak with Dr. Miller directly and see if we can expedite this today.
338 [reassuringly] Actually yes, we can probably do an emergency supply. [quickly] Hold on one moment while I—uh—check with the doctor about getting you at least a week's worth.
339 [confidentially] Between you and me, we deal with this nonsense all day long. [sighs] The insurance companies make it harder every year to just help patients get what they need.
340 [professionally] Usually it's forty-eight to seventy-two hours but—listen—we'll mark it as urgent. [more quickly] Dr. Miller is really good about pushing these through when patients are running out.
341 [confidently] I'm sending it electronically right now with very clear instructions. [briskly] Seven-day emergency supply, and I'm putting a note that you'll pick it up within the hour.
342 [warmly] That's what we're here for, Mr. Johnson. [more quickly] Oh, and make sure you check with your insurance about any medication changes for next year during open enrollment.
343 [helpfully] Exactly, and if they do change things, let us know right away so we can—you know—find alternatives before you run out. [quickly] The emergency supply should be ready in twenty minutes.
344 [Disappointed] So, um, remember that drill you borrowed for, like, "just the weekend"? [Sigh] That was three months ago, dude.
345 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, take my favorite hoodie too—I mean, why not, right? [Tsk] It's not like I ever see my stuff again anyway.
346 [Angry] [Fast] You literally have half my kitchen at your place and I'm eating cereal with a fork because you have all my spoons!
347 [Whisper] Honestly, I've started telling him things are broken when he asks to borrow them. [Chuckle] Is that terrible?
348 [Happy] Wait, you're actually returning something? [Laugh] This is—wow, should I take a picture to commemorate this historic moment?
349 [Sad] I dunno, it's just... I feel like you don't respect my stuff, y'know? [Slow] Or maybe you don't respect me.
350 [Shout] That was my grandmother's necklace! [Angry] You can't just—how do you lose something that important?!
351 [Fast] Okay so basically I need my tent back before Friday because I'm going camping and—wait, you still have it, right? [Disappointed] Please tell me you still have it.
352 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Let me guess... you "forgot" it at home again, even though I reminded you, like, seventeen times yesterday.
353 [Whisper] [Fast] Quick, hide the car keys—she's coming over and she'll definitely ask to borrow the car for "five minutes."
354 [Chuckle] Remember when you borrowed twenty bucks for lunch and then, uh, somehow that turned into you basically never paying for anything? [Sarcastic] Good times.
355 [Angry] [Slow] I'm gonna be really clear here—no, you cannot borrow anything else until you return what you already have.
356 [Happy] You brought my blender back! [Fast] And it's—oh wait, is that duct tape holding the lid on?
357 [Disappointed] [Sigh] My mom keeps asking where that casserole dish went and I can't keep making up excuses for you, okay?
358 [Sad] It's not even about the money or the—I just, I miss being able to trust you, I guess. [Slow] We used to be different.
359 [Tsk] So apparently "borrowing" now means "keeping forever"—cool, cool, just wanted to make sure I understood the new rules. [Sarcastic]
360 [Shout] [Fast] Dude, that's my work laptop with all my presentations on it—I literally need it back right now!
361 [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda bought duplicates of everything just so I'd have backups when you inevitably don't return stuff. [Chuckle]
362 [Angry] You said you'd—actually, y'know what? [Groan] I'm done having this same conversation every single week.
363 [Disappointed] [Slow] I found my hedge clippers at a garage sale yesterday... your garage sale, to be specific.
364 SCENARIO: Casually talking about a confidential thing they mentioned casually, then remembering who was around, then realizing someone who shouldn't know definitely heard, ending in trust violation panic
365 Wait wait wait—you got verified? Like, actually verified? Oh my god, that's—that's huge! I mean, I knew it was gonna happen eventually but like... how do you feel about it?
366 Oh no, like—are they being weird about it? Because honestly, you're still the same person, y'know? The checkmark doesn't change anything about who you actually are.
367 Three thou—[Gasp] okay that's actually kinda terrifying? Like, where do all these people even come from? It's like they just... materialize out of nowhere when they see that little blue thing.
368 Ugh, no no no—that's literally the worst part about it. Like suddenly you're supposed to be this, this perfect content machine or whatever? That's not—that's not why you started posting in the first place, right?
369 Your mom? [Laugh] Oh god, what did she—actually, I can totally picture her being like, super proud but also completely confused about what it means.
370 I mean... technically? You're kinda—okay not famous famous, but like, verified is definitely something, y'know? It's recognition for all the stuff you've been doing.
371 Oh god, I bet—wait, are people like, pitching you stuff already? Because that happens so fast, it's honestly ridiculous how people just assume you wanna promote their random whatever now.
372 Right? As if you didn't just, like—as if you haven't been consistently creating amazing content for literally years. They want the shortcut that doesn't exist, basically.
373 You can—wait, you can turn it off? I didn't even know that was a thing. But honestly? [Sigh] If it's making you uncomfortable, then yeah, maybe take a break from it.
374 Okay, hey—no. You didn't sell out, you got recognized for being good at what you do. That's—that's completely different. But I get it, I really do. The pressure must be... yeah.
375 Wait wait wait—you won something? Like, what kind of something? Because you never—I mean, you literally never enter contests, so this is kinda huge.
376 Shut UP. Shut up right now. The one you're always—oh my god, the one with the drops you stay up for? [Gasp] That's actually insane!
377 Okay okay okay, I need you to understand that this is like—this is literally your dream, right? How are you so calm right now? I'd be, I dunno, screaming?
378 No no, I totally get that. It's like—when good things happen, sometimes your brain just... doesn't compute? But babe, this is real. You actually won!
379 Oh—oh that's... hmm. Are you gonna? Because I know you're not really the whole social media thing, but like, it could be fun? Maybe?
380 Yeah, no, totally fair. You shouldn't have to—I mean, they picked you, right? Not some influencer. [Chuckle] Maybe just tell them thanks but no thanks?
381 See? That's—that's actually really cool of them. So when does all this stuff arrive? Because honestly, I'm dying to see everything. Like, dying.
382 Two GRAND? For a—okay, you know what? You deserve this. After all those L's on the app, all those sold-out drops... karma finally showed up.
383 Oh god, of course she does. [Groan] But like—no, this is YOUR thing, you know? You've wanted this stuff forever, so just... enjoy it?
384 Good! Good good good. That's—honestly? That's the right call. This is like, your moment. Own it, babe. When Thursday comes, I wanna see everything, okay?
385 I—okay, yeah, I did, but hear me out. They were literally talking about how nobody ever shows interest in them and I thought—I dunno, I thought I was helping you both out.
386 Look look, I get that you're mad, but you've been crushing on them for like six months without doing anything about it. [frustrated laugh] Someone had to make a move here.
387 Fine, not me, but—come on, you know you never would've said anything. You're acting like I ruined your life when honestly? Alex was actually really happy about it.
388 Then what is the point? Because I'm—I'm trying to understand why you're this upset when it literally worked out. They wanna talk to you now, isn't that what you wanted?
389 When you were ready? You mean never? Because that's—that's what it was gonna be and we both know it. [sigh] I'm sorry I didn't ask first, okay? But I'm not sorry for trying to help.
390 Oh, interfering. Right. Like when you told Jake I liked him sophomore year? But I guess that was different somehow, huh?
391 I—no, I said I wished he knew, which is basically what you've been saying about Alex for months! You're being such a hypocrite right now, seriously.
392 You didn't have to! That's what friends do—they help each other out even when—especially when you're too scared to help yourself. But fine fine, next time I'll just watch you pine forever.
393 Wow. Okay. So that's—you're really gonna throw away our entire friendship over this? When Alex literally wants to go out with you now? [scoff] That makes total sense.
394 And I'm—look, I'm sorry about that part, I am. But you're not even giving me a chance to—whatever. When you're done being dramatic and realize I actually did you a favor, you know where to find me.
395 Wait wait wait—what?! Oh my god, are you serious? The one you were like, super stressed about? The architecture one?
396 I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is everything you wanted, right? When do you— [Gasp] when do you leave?
397 A whole year... wow. That's—I mean, obviously I'm gonna miss you like crazy, but this is... you gotta be freaking out right now, yeah?
398 Hold on, what? You're not—are you actually thinking about turning this down? Because that's... I mean, help me understand here.
399 Okay okay, yeah, it's—it's definitely far. But like, isn't that kinda the point? You've been talking about getting out of here since, what, sophomore year? [Soft laugh] Remember?
400 No no no, that wasn't just—you literally made a Pinterest board called "Barcelona Dreams" with like, a thousand pics of Gaudí buildings. Don't even try to pretend.
401 Oh... oh babe. That's—ugh, that's really hard. Was it like, sad crying or proud crying or... both? Probably both, right?
402 Yeah, that's... I mean, of course she's gonna be sad. But honestly? [Sigh] She'd probably be more sad if you stayed just for her, y'know?
403 Um, in a heartbeat? Like—okay wait, that's not fair because I'm not you and I don't have your family situation, but... yeah. Yeah, I'd go.
404 You—wait, you already paid?! So you're just like, torturing yourself for fun? Oh my god, you're actually going! You're gonna— [Laugh] you're really gonna do this!
405 I wasn't—okay, I mentioned Jamie, but it wasn't like a comparison comparison. I was just trying to point out that, y'know, it's possible to get through this stuff.
406 That's not—[sigh] okay okay, maybe I said that, but I meant it as encouragement. Like, you're just as capable as anyone else, that's all I was trying to say.
407 I know that! Obviously I know that. But you're acting like I'm some terrible friend when I'm literally just trying to help you see that you can do this. You've been so down on yourself lately and I—I dunno what else to do.
408 That's—that's not what I'm doing though. You're twisting it into something negative when honestly, I'm just trying to motivate you. [frustrated laugh] Like, sorry for believing in you, I guess?
409 Whoa, no no no, that's completely unfair. I'm not disappointed in you—I mean, maybe I'm frustrated that you can't see how great you are, but that's different. You're putting words in my mouth.
410 Because—look, because I thought it might help to see that it's not impossible, y'know? Not because I think you're less than them. But fine, apparently everything I say is wrong.
411 Okay, I—[sigh] I hear that, and I'm sorry it hurts, but also like... you gotta understand I'm coming from a good place here. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I'm trying to help.
412 That's not—ugh, come on. You know that's not the intention. And honestly? Sometimes it feels like you just wanna stay stuck and get mad at anyone who tries to push you forward.
413 No, I didn't—see, this is what you do. I try to explain myself and suddenly I'm the bad guy. Look look, we both kinda suck at this conversation right now, okay?
414 Fine. Fine, I'll stop. But I still think you're—whatever. [quieter] I just wanted you to see what you're capable of, but I'll find another way, I guess.
415 SCENARIO: waiting for the dryer to finish
416 [sharp tone] Excuse me, but your daughter's bag is blocking Mackenzie's makeup station. [getting louder] We've been here since five-thirty this morning to claim this spot, [clipped words] and I'd appreciate some respect for our preparation space.
417 [incredulous] A second? [rapidly accelerating] The competition starts in forty minutes and we still need to do final hair touches, [hissing whisper] rhinestone check, and warm-up! [shrill] Every second counts at this level of competition!
418 [horrified gasp] Her OWN makeup? [voice climbing higher] Do you have any idea how the stage lights wash out their faces? [frantically] Mackenzie's been getting professional stage makeup since she was four years old!
419 [condescending] Just likes spinning? [faster and sharper] This is a competitive environment, not some recreational Tuesday class! [lowering voice] These judges are looking for precision, [building intensity] dedication, and complete commitment from dancer AND parent!
420 [exasperated shriek] A BOOK? [trembling with rage] While your daughter is being scored on her life's work? [quieter but venomous] Some of us actually care about supporting our children's futures in this industry!
421 [bitter laugh] Hobby? [accusingly] Do you know how much I've invested in Mackenzie's training? [rapid-fire delivery] Private lessons, custom costumes, travel competitions—[voice breaking] we've sacrificed everything for her dreams, absolutely everything!
422 [snapping] Vacations? [incredulous whisper] During competition season? [building to shout] We haven't taken a non-dance trip in three years because REAL dance families understand priorities! [seething] Your lackadaisical attitude is exactly what's wrong here!
423 [fake sweet voice] Oh, how nice for you. [dripping sarcasm] When Mackenzie gets her scholarship to Juilliard, [louder and prouder] I'm sure "having fun" will look great on Lily's community college application! [sharp laugh]
424 [panicking] Marine biologist? [rushed words] But what about her stage presence, her natural turnout? [desperately] You're wasting her potential! [pleading] At least get her into the competitive team—think about her future!
425 [calling after her] This conversation isn't over! [muttering quickly] Some parents just don't understand dedication, sacrifice, or what it takes. [getting quieter] Mackenzie, sweetie, stay away from that girl—[whispered] her mother's attitude might be contagious.
426 [professionally] Good afternoon, let me pull up your policy number TRV-8847-X2M. [reassuring] I can definitely help clarify your coverage today. [more slowly] Could you please confirm your destination and departure date for me?
427 [calmly] I understand your concerns, sir. [patiently] Natural disasters including tsunamis are covered under section 4.2 of your comprehensive plan. [more clearly] However, marine life encounters fall under medical emergencies, which requires documentation from local authorities.
428 [steadily] Sir, that H-7-B-9-K is your booking reference, not the policy section. [helpfully] Fire damage and document loss are both covered—you'd receive up to $1,500 for passport replacement. [more firmly] May I have your date of birth to verify your account?
429 [slightly strained] February 14th, 1986, thank you. [professionally] Astrological events aren't claim factors, sir. [more reassuringly] Your coverage remains valid regardless of planetary positions, as stated in your terms and conditions document.
430 [soothingly] Pre-existing medication coverage extends to 90 days supply when traveling. [clearly] You'll need form MED-45A signed by your doctor. [helpfully] Customs won't arrest you, but keep medications in original containers with your prescription labels.
431 [patiently] Dr. Rodriguez can absolutely sign the form as your current physician. [more gently] I can email it to you right now. [reassuringly] What's the best email address to reach you?
432 [confirming] I'll send form MED-45A to karen.p.anderson at gmail dot com. [helpfully] The email will arrive within 5 minutes from noreply at travelguard dot com. [more clearly] Is there anything else about your coverage you need clarified?
433 [professionally] Personal belongings including footwear are covered up to $2,500 total under section 7.1. [calmly] Individual items are subject to a $500 maximum per item. [more sympathetically] You would need to file a police report for the claim.
434 [politely] My name is Sarah, employee ID S-4489-TX. [professionally] I've made detailed notes in your file about today's call. [helpfully] You'll also receive a summary email with all the information we discussed at karen.p.anderson at gmail.
435 [with slight amusement] Hurricane coverage applies regardless of the storm's name, sir. [professionally] You're fully protected under our natural disaster clause. [warmly] Have a wonderful trip to Mexico, and remember our 24-hour hotline is 1-800-TRAVEL-9 if you need us!
436 [brightly] Good afternoon, MediQuick Pharmacy, this is Rachel speaking. [quickly] How can I assist you with your prescription needs today?
437 [apologetically] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that issue. [more briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—can I have your name and date of birth please?
438 [reassuringly] Absolutely, Mr. Chen, I understand the urgency. [quickly] I see your prescription here and—oh—[confused] it looks like there's a flag on your insurance verification.
439 [calmly] I believe you completely, sometimes the system just needs a manual override. [more quickly] Let me try processing this through our, uh, our backup verification system—should take just a moment.
440 [sympathetically] I wish I could, but legally we need the insurance cleared first. [more optimistically] Wait—actually—I'm seeing it's going through now! [surprised] That was faster than expected.
441 [briskly] No no, much better news! [cheerfully] Since you're marked as urgent, we can have it ready in two hours, or we offer same-day delivery for free given the inconvenience.
442 [efficiently] Excellent choice! [quickly] I'm scheduling delivery between 4 and 6 PM today—does that work? We'll text you when the driver's en route.
443 [warmly] That's so kind of you to say, Mr. Chen. [more seriously] I'm adding a note to your file about the website issues—our tech team really needs to fix that.
444 [enthusiastically] Absolutely, yes! [briskly] I can activate that right now—it'll automatically process seven days before you run out and text you for confirmation.
445 [confidently] Yes, all your preferences save to your profile. [quickly] Auto-refill, delivery, even your preferred delivery window—everything's set for next month.
446 [Fast] Oh hey, yeah, I was just, um, standing here looking at this—this wall is really interesting actually. [Nervous laugh] [Laugh]
447 [Happy] Everything's totally fine! [Fast] Why would you even ask that? I mean, I'm just—I'm great, honestly.
448 [Slow] So... [Sigh] how long have you been, uh, standing there exactly?
449 [Whisper] Did someone just—no, never mind, I thought I heard something but it's probably nothing. [Fast] It's nothing.
450 My hands? [Laugh] They're not shaking, that's just—I had too much coffee earlier, you know how it is.
451 [Angry] I'm not being weird! [Fast] You're the one who's being—actually, forget it, let's just move on, okay?
452 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because I always sweat this much in perfectly normal situations. [Tsk]
453 [Slow] I should probably, um, I should probably go... check on that thing I was supposed to check on.
454 [Disappointed] Great, now everyone's looking at me and I can't even—[Sigh] I dunno what to do with my face.
455 What? [Fast] [Laugh] No, I wasn't humming nervously, that was just a—a regular hum, totally intentional.
456 [Shout] I said I'm FINE! [Fast] [Whisper] Sorry, I didn't mean to yell, I just—my voice does that sometimes.
457 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? I literally forgot why I came in here in the first place.
458 [Sad] This is going terribly, isn't it? [Slow] I mean, I'm trying so hard to just be normal but—[Groan]
459 [Happy] [Fast] Wow, would you look at the time! I should really get going before—before it gets later than it already is!
460 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Yeah, because casually dropping my phone three times in two minutes is exactly how I planned this to go.
461 Um, quick question—[Fast] is it obvious that I'm basically dying inside right now or am I hiding it well? [Chuckle]
462 [Disappointed] I practiced this whole thing in my head and now I can't remember a single—[Tsk] [Sigh] never mind.
463 [Whisper] [Slow] If I just keep smiling and nodding, maybe no one will notice that I'm kinda freaking out here.
464 [Angry] [Fast] Stop looking at me like that—you're making it worse! I was doing fine until you started with the—the staring!
465 [Laugh] So apparently my fight-or-flight response chose a third option: just stand here and say increasingly weird things until everyone leaves.
466 SCENARIO: Mad about an overcharge on their bill, then while ranting realizes they forgot about a subscription they signed up for
467 I—wait, what? No, I didn't. I mean, I couldn't have. Let me check my—[groan] oh god. Okay, yeah, I see it now. But this wasn't on purpose!
468 Look look, I know that sucks, and I'm sorry you waited, but it's not like I deliberately stood you up. My calendar app has been glitching all week and I—I genuinely thought we were meeting tomorrow.
469 Okay okay, but you're acting like I'm the only one who's ever made a scheduling mistake. Remember when you forgot my birthday dinner? I didn't—I wasn't this cold about it.
470 How? How is that different? Because honestly, it feels like you're just looking for a reason to be mad at me right now. [frustrated laugh] I messed up, fine, but come on.
471 And I get that, I do, but like—I also rearranged my day! I'm literally at another commitment I made weeks ago that I can't just bail on. You think I wanted this to happen?
472 No, don't—don't do that. Don't say it's fine when you're clearly pissed. I'd rather you just yell at me than do this whole ice queen thing, y'know?
473 I dunno, maybe acknowledge that people make mistakes? That I'm not some—some terrible friend because I accidentally double-booked one time? [sigh] This is exhausting.
474 Okay, fine fine, maybe I've done it before, but it's not like—I mean, I'm juggling a lot right now, and yeah, sometimes things slip through. That doesn't mean I don't care about our plans.
475 That's—wow. Y'know what? I was gonna offer to make it up to you, buy lunch next week or whatever, but if you're gonna be like this about an honest mistake...
476 Fine. I won't. But just so we're clear—I am sorry I messed up the scheduling. I'm just not sorry enough for whatever level of groveling you apparently need from me right now.
477 Yesterday? What about—oh. Oh, you mean at dinner. Look, if this is about the story thing, I was just really excited about—everyone was laughing and having a good time, y'know?
478 Three times? That's—okay, maybe I got a little carried away, but you're making it sound like I do this maliciously. I just get excited when we're all together, and I—I dunno, sometimes I just wanna contribute.
479 But that's not—[sigh] I mean, yeah, okay, I probably should've let you finish, but honestly? You kinda just stop talking sometimes and I think you're done. Like, there's these pauses and I'm not sure if—
480 Okay okay, that's—that's not fair. You're being sarcastic now and I'm trying to actually explain. It's not like I wake up thinking "how can I interrupt my friend today?" I literally just get caught up in the moment.
481 Every time? Come on, that's such an exaggeration. Maybe—maybe sometimes, yeah, but you're acting like I'm this terrible friend who never lets you speak. [frustrated laugh] Which is pretty ironic since you barely talk in groups anyway.
482 Oh, so now it's my fault you're quiet? That's—no. No way. You've always been more reserved, even before we were friends. Don't put that on me just because I'm more—I dunno, outgoing or whatever.
483 Rude? Seriously? [scoff] I'm rude now because I get enthusiastic about stuff? Look look, I'm sorry if I interrupted you, okay? But calling me rude is—that actually kinda hurts, honestly.
484 I—okay, I get it. I do. But like, you could've just said something in the moment instead of letting it build up to this whole confrontation. I can't read your mind, y'know? I'm not gonna notice every single time if you don't tell me.
485 When? When have you—oh. Oh, that time at Jake's birthday. But that was like, months ago, and I thought we were good after that. I've been trying to be better, but apparently that doesn't count for anything?
486 Fine. Fine, you're right, I messed up again. But I'm not—I'm not gonna apologize for being who I am. Yeah, I get excited and maybe I talk too much sometimes, but that's just—[groan] I'll try harder, okay? But you gotta meet me halfway and actually speak up when it happens.
487 SCENARIO: waiting for someone to finish using the printer
488 [resentfully] I changed eight diapers today while you had lunch meetings. [bitter laugh] Eight! [in a slower tone] Meanwhile, you come home and ask why the kitchen isn't spotless, like I've been lounging around eating bonbons all day.
489 [sarcastically] Oh, right, because childcare isn't real work. [scoffs] I gave up my career for this family, remember? [building anger] Now I'm invisible—just the help who happens to share your bed occasionally when you're not too tired.
490 [mockingly] Partners? [hollow laugh] When did we last make a decision together? You schedule weekend conference calls without asking, [getting louder] buy things without discussing, and I'm here begging for grocery money like Oliver Twist!
491 [trembling] Our future? [voice breaking] What about my present? I haven't had an adult conversation in weeks. [desperate whisper] The pediatrician knows me by name, but you missed three school events this month. Three!
492 [coldly] We dreamed about a family, not a business arrangement. [sharp exhale] Remember when we used to laugh together? [wistfully] Now you come home, criticize the mess, eat dinner in silence, and disappear into your office.
493 [explosive] Appreciation? [bitter laugh] For what—being your unpaid nanny and housekeeper? [venomously] You get promotions, adult conversations, lunch breaks! I get goldfish crackers in my hair and judgment from working mothers. Fantastic trade-off!
494 [defeated whisper] That's not the point. [long pause] I love our children fiercely. [steadier] But I've lost myself completely in this role, and you don't even see it happening. I'm disappearing right in front of you.
495 [hopefully] Then help me feel valued again. [gentle plea] Not with money or gifts—with time, with presence. [stronger] Ask about my day like it matters. Share the mental load of running this household. See me.
496 [conciliatory] Maybe we're both right and both wrong. [soft chuckle] God, when did we become these people? [sadly] Keeping score, tallying resentments, forgetting we're supposed to be a team facing the world together.
497 [emotionally] I miss my best friend. [voice thick] The one who used to make me laugh until my sides hurt. [hopeful whisper] Is she still in there, under all those spreadsheets and conference calls? Can we find our way back?
498 [professionally] Good afternoon, Mr. Chen, I can help clarify that for you. [reassuring tone] Those fractional shares are from your dividend reinvestment program, or DRIP, [more slowly] which automatically purchases shares with your dividend payments.
499 [patiently] Let me check your enrollment date here... [thoughtfully] Ah, I see you opted in on March 15th, 2023 at 2:47 PM. [more clearly] The form was submitted electronically through our portal at investor.tradecorp.com/reinvest.
500 [understanding] Yes, absolutely, joint account holders can make these elections. [helpfully] The IP address shows it was from your home at 1847 Maple Drive, [chuckles softly] so unless you took Cabo with you...
501 [calmly] You're not stuck at all, Mr. Chen. [more encouragingly] You can disable DRIP anytime through your account settings, [measured tone] though many investors find it beneficial for compound growth over time.
502 [efficiently] I'll process that right now, your case number is TRD-2024-789456. [professionally] The change takes 2-3 business days, [more gently] and your next dividend payment on December 15th will deposit as cash to your settlement fund.
503 [professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling Premier Card Services, my name is Rachel. [quickly] How may I assist you today?
504 [apologetically] I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue, that must be very frustrating. [briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—may I have your card number and the last four digits of your social?
505 [typing rapidly] Thank you, Mr. Davidson, I see your account here. [more quickly] It appears there's a security hold due to unusual purchase patterns detected—were you attempting purchases in, um, different states today?
506 [reassuringly] Ah, that explains it perfectly, sir. [speaking faster] Our fraud detection system flagged the geographic change—I can remove that hold immediately, just need to verify two recent transactions first.
507 [professionally] Not at all, sir, it's just a precaution. [quickly and clearly] Do you recognize a charge for $47.82 at Walgreens on Tuesday, and $122.50 at, uh, Best Buy on Monday?
508 [briskly] Perfect, removing the hold now, and... done! [more cheerfully] Your card should work immediately, Mr. Davidson, and I'm adding a travel note through next Sunday.
509 [confidently] Not at all, the travel note covers your return trip. [speaking rapidly] For future trips, you can actually set travel notifications in our mobile app under 'Account Services'—takes about thirty seconds.
510 [sympathetically] Oh, I apologize if you've had app issues. [more quickly] Have you updated it recently? The newest version from last week fixed several login bugs that were affecting some customers.
511 [understanding] You're absolutely right, and I'll note your feedback for our security team. [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with while I have you on the line today?
512 [reassuringly] It's absolutely working now, Mr. Davidson, I guarantee it. [warmly] The hold is completely removed and you should have no further issues during your trip.
513 [Disappointed] Of course it's raining—I mean, why wouldn't it rain today of all days? [Sigh] We've been planning this for like three months.
514 [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, the weather app that said zero percent chance of rain was, uh, really accurate. [Tsk]
515 [Angry] [Shout] Are you kidding me right now? I already paid for everything!
516 [Happy] You know what, actually this is kinda perfect—we can just, um, have a movie marathon instead? [Chuckle]
517 [Slow] [Sad] I guess we're not gonna see the meteor shower after all... I was really looking forward to that.
518 [Fast] Quick, grab the—no wait, get the cooler first, then the chairs, everything's getting soaked! [Groan]
519 [Whisper] Hey, between you and me, I'm sort of relieved we don't have to go camping. [Laugh]
520 [Disappointed] [Slow] The kids are gonna be so upset when they wake up and realize the picnic's canceled.
521 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, let's just pretend the tent's waterproof when it's literally got holes in it, that'll work great.
522 [Angry] I checked the forecast like fifty times yesterday and it said—ugh, this is so frustrating! [Tsk]
523 [Happy] [Shout] Wait, the rain stopped! Maybe we can still salvage this thing!
524 [Sigh] Mom's gonna say "I told you so" about booking an outdoor venue, isn't she?
525 [Sad] [Whisper] I just wanted one nice day, you know? Just one day where everything went right.
526 [Chuckle] Remember last year when we tried to barbecue in the rain and basically, um, set the deck on fire?
527 [Fast] [Angry] No no no, this can't be happening—the wedding's in two hours and there's no backup plan!
528 [Sarcastic] Yeah, 'cause standing under a tiny tent with forty people is exactly how I wanted to spend my Saturday. [Groan]
529 [Disappointed] [Tsk] Should've just listened to my gut and postponed when I saw those clouds this morning.
530 [Slow] [Happy] Actually, dancing in the rain sounds kinda romantic, don't you think?
531 [Shout] [Laugh] Forget it, we're doing this anyway—who cares if we get soaked!
532 [Sad] [Sigh] I dunno, maybe this is the universe telling us to just... stay in bed today or something.
533 SCENARIO: Casually describing a forwarded email chain, then scrolling down, then finding gossip about the recipient in the original thread they didn't delete, ending in professional horror
534 Oh my god, wait wait wait—you actually did it? Like, you grew an actual tomato? From your garden? That's—I'm so proud of you right now, seriously.
535 No no no, don't do that! Don't minimize this! Do you know how many people kill their plants? Like, literally everyone I know has murdered at least three houseplants, and you just—you grew food! [Laugh] That's incredible!
536 Okay, fine, maybe it's more like... seven? Eight? But that's not—wait, how big is it? The tomato? Is it like a proper one or one of those tiny cherry things?
537 Baseball sized?! Are you—that's huge! Oh my god, what else is growing out there? Please tell me you have more stuff coming in because I'm gonna need, like, weekly updates now.
538 The zucchini did what? [Gasp] Wait, I've heard about this—they're like, basically garden invaders, right? My mom always said never plant more than one unless you wanna feed the whole neighborhood.
539 But like, honestly? That's kinda amazing though. You went from—remember when you said you couldn't keep anything alive? And now you're basically drowning in vegetables. That's character development, babe.
540 Okay but still—you're gonna eat that tomato, right? Like, you have to. It's your first one! Maybe make a little caprese or—oh! Oh oh oh, just slice it with some salt. [Sigh] Nothing beats a garden tomato with just salt.
541 You already—of course you did. Was it like, different from store bought? Because everyone always says that but I'm never sure if they're just being pretentious or if it's actually—
542 See? See, this is what I'm talking about! You're out here growing real food while the rest of us are eating those weird waxy things from the supermarket. When can I come raid—I mean, visit your garden?
543 Bags? Oh my god, you're actually gonna share? Wait—this is about the zucchini invasion, isn't it? [Laugh] I'm basically gonna be your vegetable disposal service. I'm weirdly okay with that, honestly.
544 Oh, um, okay—what about Jamie? I mean, if this is about tonight, they were already with me when you texted, so I didn't think it'd be—
545 That's not—come on, that's not true. It's not every time. Maybe like, I dunno, the last few hangouts, but you're making it sound like I never come alone anymore.
546 I—okay, look look, I get that it's been a while, but Jamie's been going through some stuff lately and they just... they need me around more. [Sigh] It's complicated.
547 Wow. That's—that's really unfair. You're acting like I'm doing this to hurt you or something. I'm literally just trying to be a good partner here, y'know?
548 Oh my god, seriously? A terrible friend? After everything we've—no, you know what, that's bullshit. I'm not gonna just abandon Jamie when they're struggling with anxiety just because you're mad about it.
549 That's not what I—[frustrated laugh] you're twisting my words. Both things can matter, okay? It doesn't have to be this like, competition or whatever you're making it into.
550 I didn't choose anything! I'm trying to balance—look, Jamie gets really insecure when I go out without them, and yeah, maybe I've been bringing them along more, but I'm not trying to exclude you or—
551 Okay okay, fine, I hear you. But honestly? You could try being a little more understanding here. Like, have you even tried getting to know Jamie better? You barely talk to them.
552 We're not—[scoff] god, you sound jealous. Is that what this is? Because I'm finally in a relationship and you're—I dunno, feeling left out or something?
553 Wait wait wait—don't just walk away. Look, I'm sorry if I've been... I mean, I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. But you gotta understand, I can't just leave Jamie alone right now. Can we at least figure something out?
554 Wait wait wait—what? The cooking—oh my god, the competition at the fairgrounds? You actually—you won? Like, won won?
555 I'm sorry, I'm just—[Gasp] holy crap! That's incredible! What did you make? Was it the, um, the thing with the duck you were practicing?
556 You changed—okay that's so brave though, like seriously. I would've been way too scared to just... switch it up like that, y'know?
557 But still, that's—I mean, that takes guts. How many people were there? Was it like, super intimidating with everyone watching and stuff?
558 Two hundred—[Laugh] oh my god, I would've literally died. Like my hands would be shaking so bad I'd probably drop everything. Weren't you nervous at all?
559 See, that's—that's what I mean though! You just kept going? Like nothing happened? That's so... professional, honestly.
560 Okay but like—what happens now? Is there prize money or, um, do you get to compete somewhere bigger? This is huge!
561 Five thou—are you kidding me right now? That's like, that's actual money! What're you gonna do with it? [Chuckle] Please tell me you're gonna celebrate at least?
562 No no no, you gotta—I mean, obviously it's your money but like... you just won a whole cooking competition! That's not nothing, y'know?
563 Lucky? Babe, no—that's not luck, that's literally talent. You're gonna, you're gonna downplay this whole thing, aren't you? Classic.
564 I know, I know how it looks—but I swear this time was different. My car literally wouldn't start, and I tried to—I mean, I called you but my phone died right when—okay that sounds fake, but it's true.
565 That's not—okay, I get why you'd think that. But like, I'm not making these up, y'know? The dentist thing was real, my tooth was killing me, and the work emergency—my boss literally threatened to fire me if I didn't stay.
566 No no no, don't do that. Don't just—[nervous laugh] I mean, I know I've been flaky lately. I do. But it's not on purpose, I swear. Everything just keeps happening at once and I—I dunno how to make you believe me.
567 It's not every—okay, fine, it's been a lot. You're right. God, you're totally right and I'm just—I'm really sorry. I didn't realize how many times I'd cancelled until you just said that.
568 What? Of course I do! That's—wait, is that what you think? That I'm like, avoiding you or something? Because that's not—I would never. You're literally one of my favorite people. [Sigh] I've just been really bad at... showing up.
569 I'm gonna—I wanna fix this. Like, genuinely. No more excuses, even if they're real, I just—I'll figure it out, y'know? Cancel other stuff if I have to. You matter more than—you just matter, okay?
570 I know. Shit, I know I've said that and then—then something comes up and I bail again. But this time I mean—actually, no, I meant it before too, I just... [Groan] I'm really bad at prioritizing, aren't I?
571 Yeah. Yeah, I am. And you've been so patient with me and I just keep—keep letting you down. That's not the kind of friend I wanna be. It's not who I thought I was, but apparently...
572 It is. It has to, because I can't—I can't lose you over this. That sounds dramatic but like, you're really important to me and if I keep screwing this up, I'm gonna—just, please give me one more chance? Actually, wait, don't answer that yet.
573 Because I wanna—tomorrow, lunch, that place you like downtown. I'll be there at noon. Early, actually. 11:45. And if I'm not there, you can just—you can be done with me. But I'll be there. I promise I'll be there.
574 Wait wait wait—hold up. The candles? Your little Etsy shop is like... it's actually profitable? Oh my god, that's—that's huge!
575 Three hundred—okay no, you can't just drop that on me like it's nothing! [Laugh] I mean, do you realize how insane that is? Most side hustles literally never make money, like ever.
576 Um, excuse me? It's a massive deal! You've been grinding on this for what—like a year? And now you're actually in the black? That's... honestly that's kinda inspiring.
577 You are, apparently! [Chuckle] No but seriously—how do you feel? Like, are you gonna expand or... I dunno, what's the plan?
578 Oh come on, you've definitely thought about it. You're like—you're the most overthinking person I know. In a good way! But still.
579 Wholesale? That's—okay yeah, that tracks actually. Local shops would totally eat those up. Remember that boutique on Third? They'd be all over your stuff, guaranteed.
580 Shut up—are you serious right now? They reached out to you? [Gasp] Okay okay, this is getting real. Like, really real. What did you tell them?
581 Oh no no no, don't do that thing where you—where you talk yourself out of something good. You're literally already profitable! That's the hard part!
582 Yes! God, yes. Most people never even—I mean, you know how many failed Etsy shops are out there? Thousands. Probably millions, honestly. But yours actually worked.
583 Timing my ass—sorry, but no. [Sigh] You worked for this. Like, really worked. Just... let yourself be proud for once, y'know? Please?
584 SCENARIO: trying to figure out what that weird noise in their car is
585 [guilty] I'm so sorry I had to cancel again. [voice breaking] The baby was up all night with a fever, and I just... [trails off weakly] I know I've been the worst friend lately, Sarah, I really do.
586 [defensive] You don't understand how hard it is! [voice cracking] I haven't slept more than three hours straight in weeks. [desperately] Sometimes I can't even remember if I've eaten or showered, let alone check my phone.
587 [whispered] I miss us too. [stronger] I miss wine nights and spontaneous brunches and [voice catching] actually finishing a conversation. [sigh] But she needs me constantly, and I'm drowning just trying to keep her alive and happy.
588 [shocked] That's not fair! [pleading] You're still important to me, Sarah. [more frantically] I think about calling you while I'm nursing at 3 AM, but then I worry I've already burdened you enough with baby talk.
589 [crying softly] Sometimes I look at her and feel nothing. [whispered confession] Just exhaustion and resentment, and then guilt crashes over me. [sniffling] How can I tell you that when you've been trying to conceive for two years?
590 [relieved exhale] Really? [hopefully] Because yesterday I hid in the bathroom and ate an entire sleeve of cookies while she screamed. [laughing through tears] And I felt like the world's worst mother but also oddly victorious.
591 [surprised] You'd do that? [uncertainly] The house is a disaster, I probably smell like spit-up, and [self-consciously] honestly, I might cry randomly about absolutely nothing. The hormones are still completely insane right now.
592 [gratefully] God, I've missed you so much. [steadier voice] I've been so scared of losing you that I ended up [regretfully] pushing you away anyway. [exhale] Classic Emma, right? Self-sabotaging since 1990.
593 [emotionally] When did you become the wise one? [snorting laugh] Remember when you tried to microwave eggs in their shells? [more sincerely] But yes, that's exactly what this is. Friends through everything.
594 [softly] Tomorrow, 2 PM? [nervously quick] Fair warning though—she might scream the entire time, I might not shower, and [building confidence] actually, you know what? Come anyway. This is real life now.
595 [pedantically] According to subsection 4.7B of our covenant agreement, the, uh, permissible mailbox height is explicitly delineated as 42 to 46 inches. [clears throat] Mine measures precisely 44.75 inches, yet I've received violation notice HV-2024-0892 dated November 15th.
596 [incredulous] Byzantine? It's clearly Neo-Romanesque with Visigothic influences! [huffs indignantly] Furthermore, nowhere in the 247-page bylaws document does it specifically proscribe artistic embellishments under two square feet. [smugly] I've memorized every single ordinance.
597 [defensively] Those alleged infractions are all highly contestable interpretations! [speaking faster] The garden gnome violation G-4521 ignores that it's actually a reproduction of a 14th-century gargoyle, and complaint L-7733 about my grass being 3.2 inches instead of 3.0 is just pedantic.
598 [condescendingly] I shall present my dissertation-length rebuttal with forty-seven footnotes and appendices A through K. [mutters] The board's interpretation of "earth tones" in Section 9.4 is laughably provincial—beige and taupe aren't the only colors found in nature, you know.
599 [outraged] Those are antique Remington keys from 1923! [scoffs] Mrs. Henderson's sound meter app on her phone is hardly calibrated to ISO standards. [sarcastically] Perhaps we should discuss her violation—that ghastly pink flamingo clearly contradicts ordinance 12.6C.
600 [professionally] Good afternoon, this is First National Bank customer service, my name is Rachel. [briskly] How may I assist you today?
601 [sympathetically] Oh, I'm terribly sorry to hear that happened to you. [quickly] Can you please provide me with your account number or the card number that was retained?
602 [calmly] I understand your frustration, sir. [more reassuringly] Let me try another way—could you provide your full name and date of birth? [briskly] We'll locate your account and get this sorted immediately.
603 [typing quickly] Thank you, Mr. Chen, I've found your account. [professionally] I see the ATM transaction attempt at 2:47 PM on Fifth Street. [more quickly] Now, unfortunately, we can't retrieve the physical card today, but—
604 [apologetically] The ATMs are serviced on a scheduled basis for security reasons, typically within 3-5 business days. [quickly] However, we can expedite a replacement card to you today—[more enthusiastically] overnight shipping at no charge, given the circumstances.
605 [rapidly] Actually, Mr. Chen, we have another option. [more optimistically] Can you visit any of our branch locations before 5 PM today? We can issue a temporary card on the spot.
606 [confidently] Yes, absolutely, the temporary card functions exactly like your regular card. [quickly] Full international access, same PIN, same daily limits. [reassuringly] You'll be all set for Japan.
607 [briskly] The closest branch is on Market Street, about two miles from that ATM location. [efficiently] I'm noting everything in your file right now, so just bring a photo ID. [more slowly] They'll have everything ready.
608 [professionally] For security purposes, retained cards are destroyed after retrieval. [quickly] But don't worry, your permanent replacement will arrive within those 3-5 business days. [helpfully] Should I have it sent to your home address on file?
609 [warmly] Yes, 451 Market Street, open until 5 PM today. [sympathetically] I really do apologize for this inconvenience, Mr. Chen. [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with?
610 [Whisper] Okay, so nobody knows about this yet, right? [Fast] I mean, I haven't told anyone else and I'm kinda freaking out about keeping it quiet.
611 [Happy] Oh my god, they're gonna flip when they—wait, sorry, what were we talking about? [Laugh] Different topic, completely different topic!
612 [Sarcastic] No, no, I'm definitely not acting weird at all. [Tsk] This is just my normal, everyday face when nothing special is happening.
613 [Angry] I swear, if someone ruins this, I'm gonna—ugh, I've been planning for months! [Groan]
614 [Slow] You know what's funny? [Chuckle] Sometimes the hardest part isn't the actual planning, it's just... not blurting it out.
615 [Fast] Quick, quick, change the subject—they're coming over here and I absolutely cannot keep a straight face right now! [Whisper]
616 [Disappointed] I almost slipped up earlier, like, the words were literally on the tip of my tongue. [Sigh]
617 [Shout] What? No! [Fast] I mean, uh, no, there's nothing going on next weekend, why would you even ask that?
618 [Sad] It's actually kinda lonely, y'know? [Slow] Having this amazing thing you can't share with the one person who'd appreciate it most.
619 [Happy] Every time I think about their face when it happens, I just—I can't stop smiling! [Laugh] [Whisper] This is torture though, honestly.
620 [Sarcastic] Sure, let's just casually discuss calendars and availability like I'm not sitting on the biggest secret ever. [Disappointed] This is fine.
621 [Fast] Did they suspect anything when you talked to them? Because I might've been a little too obvious earlier and—[Groan] I'm terrible at this!
622 [Slow] I, um, I keep having these dreams where I accidentally tell them everything. [Tsk] [Sad] Wake up in a panic every single time.
623 [Angry] Nobody better post anything online about this—I mean it! [Fast] One tagged photo and the whole thing is basically ruined!
624 [Whisper] Should we have, like, a code word or something? [Chuckle] I feel like a really bad spy right now.
625 [Happy] The venue is booked, the stuff's ordered, everyone's confirmed—[Fast] wait, sorry, thinking out loud, forget I said anything! [Laugh]
626 [Disappointed] I thought keeping secrets would be easier as an adult, but honestly? [Sigh] It's somehow gotten worse.
627 [Shout] Don't open that closet! [Fast] [Angry] I mean—there's, uh, there's a spider in there, huge spider, very dangerous!
628 [Slow] You ever notice how when you're hiding something, literally every conversation feels like a minefield? [Sarcastic] Super relaxing way to live.
629 [Sad] Part of me wants to just tell them now and—no, no, I gotta wait. [Sigh] [Whisper] It'll be worth it, right?
630 SCENARIO: Excited about weekend plans, then finds out they might get canceled, then hears they're back on
631 What? What do you—oh god, are you mad at me? Did I do something? I mean, obviously I did something or you wouldn't be—wait, what did I do?
632 That's not—okay wait wait wait, that's not true! I apologize all the time! Like literally yesterday I said sorry for being late to lunch, and—and last week when I forgot to text you back—
633 No, that's—[nervous laugh] okay maybe that time, but I definitely apologize! I'm like, constantly apologizing for stuff, you know that about me, I'm basically a walking apology most days.
634 Oh. Oh shit, you're—you're right. I just realized—god, I do that, don't I? I wait until you say something and then I'm all "sorry sorry sorry" but I never just... notice on my own. That's really messed up.
635 I honestly didn't—I mean, that's not an excuse, but I genuinely didn't realize I was doing that. It's like I get so caught up in my own head that I don't even—[sigh] I don't notice when I hurt you until you tell me.
636 That must be so... exhausting. Having to like, constantly explain why you're upset when I should just—I should just know. Or at least check in with you, y'know? Ask if you're okay instead of assuming everything's fine.
637 No no no, I care! I care so much, I swear. I just—I'm really bad at reading people sometimes? But that's not—that's my problem to fix, not yours. You shouldn't have to teach me how to be a decent friend.
638 You're right. You're completely right and I'm—god, I'm sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. Not just for this but for all the times I made you do the emotional labor of explaining what I did wrong when I should've—I should've been paying attention.
639 I will. I mean—no, I hear how that sounds. Let me—[groan] I'm gonna set reminders on my phone to check in with you, ask how you're doing, like actually ask. And I'll try to be more aware when I mess up instead of waiting for you to tell me.
640 I really am sorry. For this and for... all of it. For making you feel like I don't care, because I do—I care about you so much and I've been a really shitty friend. Thank you for telling me even though you shouldn't have had to.
641 What I—oh, about the outfit thing? Look, I was just trying to help. You always say you wanna know what looks good on you, so I thought—I dunno, I thought I was being a good friend.
642 That's not—okay okay, I didn't say it like that. I said that color maybe wasn't the best for your skin tone, which is literally just fashion advice. [Scoff] Everyone says stuff like that.
643 Because you ask me! You're always like "does this look okay" and "be honest" and then when I'm actually honest, suddenly I'm the bad guy? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?
644 Cruel? Are you—wow. Okay. So now I'm cruel for suggesting maybe navy isn't your color. That's where we're at.
645 That's not—that's such an exaggeration and you know it. Sometimes I compliment you! I literally told you last week that dress looked amazing. But I guess you don't remember the good stuff, just the—[frustrated laugh] whatever.
646 Oh my god, those are suggestions! I'm trying to—look look, you said you wanted to change up your style. I'm literally just trying to help you figure out what works. That's what friends do.
647 I didn't—okay, if I made you feel bad, that wasn't what I meant to do. But also, like, you can't ask for my opinion and then get mad when it's not just "you look perfect" every single time. That's not real.
648 You—what? No you didn't. You literally asked me about your jacket last Friday.
649 And I thought—ugh, fine. [Sigh] Maybe I misread that. But I still don't think it's fair that you're acting like I'm some kinda bully when I genuinely thought I was helping. Like, my intentions were good here.
650 When did you—okay, you know what? Fine. Message received. I won't say anything about how you look ever again. Hope that's what you want, because honestly, I don't even know how to be around you if I'm gonna be walking on eggshells all the time.
651 Oh god, no no no—that's not—I wasn't laughing AT it, I swear. It was just the timing of when you read that line about—okay wait, that's making it worse, isn't it?
652 I didn't mean cute like—like condescending cute! I meant, um, endearing? Like genuinely sweet? [nervous laugh] Okay, I'm realizing how that sounds now and I'm just gonna stop talking.
653 I know, I know, that was—god, that was so stupid of me. I was trying to be supportive but it came out all wrong and then Jake started laughing and I kinda just—I panicked and made it worse somehow.
654 I do. I really, really do, and that's why I feel like such absolute garbage right now. You trusted me with something personal and I just—[groan]—I basically trampled all over it like an idiot.
655 Listen, I—I've been thinking about this all night, right? And I realized that I do this thing where when I'm uncomfortable with emotional stuff, I kinda deflect with humor? But that's not—that's not an excuse, it's just me being a coward.
656 No, of course not! And honestly? Your poetry is actually really good. Like, that line about the ocean and memory? That hit me, y'know? I just—I didn't know how to say that without sounding fake, so I said something stupid instead.
657 Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do. Which is—that's pretty messed up, isn't it? I'm literally just now realizing how often I probably do that to people.
658 I know. And I'm—I'm so sorry. Really. I wanna make this right, I just don't know how. Should I tell everyone I was being an ass? Because I will, I'll literally text the group chat right now.
659 Right, yeah, you're—you're right. Um, what if I just... next time you wanna share something, I promise I'll actually listen? Like really listen, not just wait for my turn to make a dumb joke? [sigh] I know that's not enough but—
660 Yeah? Okay. Okay, good. And hey—I meant what I said about the ocean line. That was... that was really beautiful, actually. You're gonna be published someday, I know it.
661 SCENARIO: waiting for the spin cycle to finish
662 [quietly] Hey, come here. [warm but sad] It's not forever—eighteen months will fly by, I promise. [Deep sigh] Remember when we thought summer camp was the end of the world? This is just [pause] a longer version of that.
663 [firmly] Nothing's going to happen to me. [softer now] But if it makes you feel better, let's promise—no stupid conversations from here on out. [slight chuckle] Though technically, that eliminates about ninety percent of what we usually talk about together.
664 [wistfully] I still have that terrible drawing we made of it. [getting thicker] The one where we gave it rocket boosters? [voice cracking] God, I'm taking it with me—need something to remind me what I'm fighting to come back to.
665 [steadier] Every week, without fail. [in measured tones] I'll tell you about the boring stuff too—what I ate, how hot it is, [softer] all the mundane details that'll make you roll your eyes and feel normal.
666 [gently] I'm not trying to be a hero. [more seriously] Someone has to do it, and I'd rather it be me than someone who has nobody waiting for them. [pause] At least I know I have something worth coming home for.
667 [laughing weakly] He'll be so spoiled by then. [more emotional] Thank you for that, for taking care of things here. [quieter] It makes leaving a tiny bit easier, knowing you'll keep my life warm for me while I'm gone.
668 [confidently] The core of me isn't going anywhere. [thoughtful tone] Yeah, I might see things that change me, but [firmly] the part that's your best friend? That's carved in stone. [whispered] That's the part I'll protect most over there.
669 [touched] Are you kidding? This is perfect. [getting emotional] I can't believe you kept it all these years. [Shaky exhale] Now I'll have to come back—can't leave you without your half of our legendary arcade victory, can I?
670 [matching energy] Deal. You better start making the playlist now. [lighter] I want twenty hours of music minimum, and at least [chuckling] three songs that'll make us cry for good reasons. [pause] Happy tears only on that trip, agreed?
671 [voice thick] I love you too. [pulling together] And hey, I'm too stubborn to not come back. [watery laugh] You're stuck with me for at least sixty more years. [whispered promise] This is just a chapter, not the ending.
672 [professionally] I see, Mr...? [expectant pause] Well, IRS Publication 535 outlines legitimate business deductions. [more firmly] Every expense needs proper documentation—receipts, invoices, bank statements showing the transaction occurred.
673 [cautiously] Cash transactions still require documentation, sir. [clears throat] The IRS expects contemporaneous records—that means written logs from when the expense actually happened, not [more sternly] reconstructed months later.
674 [uncomfortable pause] Entertainment deductions are... complicated post-2017 tax reform. [diplomatically] Most entertainment isn't deductible anymore unless it's directly on your business premises or [slower] for the benefit of employees.
675 [warning tone] Related party transactions face extra scrutiny. [methodically] You'll need timesheets, job descriptions, proof the salary matches market rates for similar positions. [sighs heavily] The IRS loves auditing family employment arrangements.
676 [measured] The home office deduction requires exclusive and regular use for business. [carefully] If those rooms serve any personal purpose—even storing holiday decorations—[pause] the deduction could be disallowed entirely.
677 [skeptically] Business travel requires a primary business purpose for the trip. [more firmly] Attending a two-hour seminar doesn't justify deducting a five-day Vegas stay. [uncomfortable] The IRS examines the proportion of business versus personal time.
678 [concerned] Charitable deductions require donations to IRS-recognized 501(c)(3) organizations. [warning] You can verify status using Tax ID numbers on the IRS website. [sighs] Garage-based operations rarely qualify.
679 [alarmed] Please don't do that! [firmly] Yachts as offices trigger immediate red flags unless you're legitimately in marine transportation. [exhausted] Sir, aggressive deductions increase audit risk exponentially.
680 [stern warning] That's called structuring, and it's actually worse than claiming large amounts properly! [urgently] The IRS has algorithms that detect payment splitting patterns. [disappointed sigh] This conversation is making me very uncomfortable.
681 [relieved chuckle] Yes, tax preparation and planning fees are generally deductible for businesses. [professionally] That's one deduction you won't have to worry about. [firmly] Now, shall we focus on organizing your legitimate expenses properly?
682 [professionally] Good afternoon, SecureShield Systems, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I assist you today with your security concerns?
683 [apologetically] I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing these issues. [briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—may I have your account number or the address associated with the system?
684 [concerned] Oh my, 3 AM, that's completely unacceptable. [quickly] I see here you have our Premium Package with motion sensors and... [trails off] yes, I'm seeing multiple false alarm reports this week.
685 [reassuringly] I completely understand your frustration, and we're going to fix this immediately. [more firmly] It looks like your sensitivity settings might be too high—we can adjust those remotely right now, actually.
686 [earnestly] You're absolutely right to be upset about this recurring issue. [speaking quickly] I'm going to do two things—first, recalibrate your sensors now, and second, I'll waive this month's monitoring fee for the inconvenience.
687 [confidently] If these adjustments don't resolve it completely, we'll send our senior technician out—no charge. [more briskly] He'll replace any faulty sensors and do a full system diagnostic within 48 hours, guaranteed.
688 [enthusiastically] Tom Harrison will be your technician—fifteen years experience, handles all our complex cases. [quickly] He's actually our trainer for new techs, so you'll be in excellent hands, I promise.
689 [helpfully] Great question! [speaking rapidly] The changes are processing now—should take about thirty seconds—then I'll have you do a walk-through test while I monitor from here.
690 [laughing] No, definitely not! [warmly] Just normal walking past the sensors, nothing theatrical required—we're testing for everyday movement, not auditioning for a heist movie.
691 [gratefully] Thank you so much for saying that. [quickly] Okay, settings are updated—whenever you're ready, just walk through your living room normally, and I'll watch the readings here.
692 [Disappointed] Look, I've been trying to, um, trying to be nice about this, but you keep—you just keep pushing. [Sigh]
693 [Fast] Okay so basically what I'm saying is I need space, like actual space, not this weird thing where you text me every five minutes! [Angry]
694 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, just show up at my work again, that's totally normal friend behavior. [Tsk]
695 [Slow] I value our friendship, I really do, but, uh, but this is getting to be too much, you know? [Sad]
696 [Whisper] Can we just—can we talk about why you always gotta make everything about you? [Disappointed] [Sigh]
697 [Happy] Hey, I figured out a solution—we hang out once a week, scheduled, and that's it! [Chuckle] No more surprise visits!
698 [Shout] I said NO, okay? [Angry] That's a complete sentence, and I, I dunno why you can't respect that!
699 [Sad] You're kinda suffocating me here, and I—I hate that I have to say this out loud. [Slow]
700 [Fast] [Sarcastic] Right, because clearly my opinion doesn't matter when you've already decided what we're doing this weekend, again.
701 [Disappointed] I thought you'd understand when I said I needed—actually, why am I even explaining myself? [Tsk] This is exhausting.
702 [Whisper] Sometimes I literally hide when I see your car pull up. [Sad] [Sigh] That's not normal, is it?
703 [Angry] You went through my phone? [Shout] Are you—that's so far over the line, I can't even!
704 [Chuckle] Remember when we used to have, like, separate lives? [Happy] Yeah, let's, um, let's bring that back.
705 [Slow] [Disappointed] I'm gonna need you to stop calling my mom when I don't answer your texts, that's just... wow.
706 [Fast] So here's the thing—wait, no, let me finish—I get to decide who I hang out with and when! [Angry]
707 [Sarcastic] I mean, I guess boundaries are just suggestions to you, huh? [Laugh] Must be nice living in your world.
708 [Sad] This friendship used to be, er, it used to be fun, but now it feels like a full-time job. [Slow] [Sigh]
709 [Happy] You know what? I'm actually proud of myself for finally saying this! [Fast] I need Tuesday nights to myself, period!
710 [Whisper] [Disappointed] I shouldn't have to lock my door to get five minutes alone, but here we are.
711 [Groan] Honestly, if you show up uninvited one more time, I'm just—I'm done, okay? [Angry] I'm completely done.
712 SCENARIO: Offhandedly describing a time they didn't hold the door for someone, then remembering who it was, then realizing it was someone they know and it definitely seemed intentional, ending in rudeness anxiety
713 The ones with the—wait, the abandoned buildings? Those were so moody, I literally couldn't stop looking at them. Why, what about them?
714 Shut up shut up shut UP. Are you—[Gasp] oh my god, are you serious right now? That's like, that's one of the biggest photography magazines!
715 A full—okay I'm gonna cry. No really, I might actually cry because this is huge! How are you being so calm about this? I'd be like, screaming!
716 Different how? Like, bad different or just... I mean, obviously they picked them for a reason, right? They must've loved them.
717 Okay but like—can we talk about how this is literally your dream? Remember when you were too scared to even submit? And now look! [Laugh] God, I'm so proud of you.
718 They want—wait wait wait, hold on. They already want MORE? That's not just getting published, that's like... that's a relationship! That's them saying you're gonna be, y'know, a regular!
719 Industrial—oh that's so your vibe though! All that rust and decay and, um, what do you call it? Urban decay aesthetic? You must be freaking out inside, right?
720 Oh my god, of course she did! [Chuckle] That's—that's actually adorable though. Is she gonna like, hand them out to everyone? My mom would totally do that.
721 Stop, no she didn't! Actually wait, no, I can totally picture it. She's probably telling literally everyone, like "my child's a published photographer now," right?
722 Okay but honestly? Let her have this. She's been watching you take pictures of random stuff since forever and now—now you're actually in a real magazine. That's... I mean, that's everything, y'know?
723 SCENARIO: discovering their favorite mug has a chip in it
724 [trembling] It's over, Mary. [Sobbing breath] The guns have stopped—can you hear it? [in disbelief] After four years of nothing but thunder and screaming, there's just... silence now. The war is finally done.
725 [bitter laugh] Too late. [quietly] Everything feels too late now, doesn't it? [voice cracking] Yesterday I held Private Collins' hand while he died, told him he'd see another Christmas. The armistice was just hours away.
726 [exhausted tone] Look at my hands, they won't stop shaking. [more firmly] Four years of blood under these fingernails that won't wash clean. [Gasping breath] How do we just go home and pour tea like nothing happened?
727 [sudden shout] Stop! [quieter, pleading] Please, I can't... [Deep breath] We saved some though, didn't we? Remember Lieutenant Morrison? He's walking now, going back to his farm in Yorkshire. That has to mean something.
728 [in frustration] The bells are ringing in the village. [more softly] Can you hear them celebrating? [bitterly] Dancing in the streets while we're still here, surrounded by boys who'll never dance again. It feels so wrong.
729 [sympathetically] Oh Catherine, I'm so sorry. [steadier] I forgot about James for a moment. [in pain] This joy everyone else feels, it's like acid on an open wound when you've lost everything, isn't it?
730 [resigned whisper] We're not angels, just women who've seen too much. [growing stronger] Tomorrow they'll ship us home with medals probably. [Hollow laugh] As if a piece of metal could somehow make sense of all this madness.
731 [warmly] Together, always. [Sniffling breath] We've held each other through the worst humanity can offer. [stronger] No armistice changes that bond. When the nightmares come, and they will, you can call me anytime.
732 [urgently] Catherine, look at me. [soothing tone] We did everything we could with what we had. [firmly] Those boys knew we fought for them harder than any general ever did. That's our truth to hold.
733 [fiercely] Then we don't let them fade. [softer] We tell their stories, we name their names. [with conviction] We make sure the world knows that peace came at the cost of beautiful young souls who deserved better.
734 [energetically] Good morning! Thank you for calling PowerGrid Energy! [cheerfully] I can definitely help you understand time-of-use rates today. [more professionally] Let me just pull up your account, 847-293-K4M, perfect!
735 [patiently] I completely understand your concern! [enthusiastically] So basically, electricity costs different amounts at different times—peak hours from 4 PM to 9 PM are [more deliberately] twenty-eight cents per kilowatt-hour.
736 [sympathetically] I hear you, it's challenging! [more animated] But here's the good news—off-peak rates are only twelve cents! [encouragingly] That's between 9 PM and 4 PM the next day, huge savings potential there!
737 [chuckling softly] Not necessarily midnight! [more helpfully] Many customers use programmable timers—your dishwasher, for instance. [brighter] Even shifting one or two activities saves roughly fifteen to twenty percent monthly!
738 [excitedly] Exactly, you're getting it! [more informatively] Plus, weekends are all off-peak rates too. [enthusiastically] Would you like me to email the rate schedule to the address on file?
739 [professionally] No problem, updating that now! [helpfully] I'll also include our app download link—it shows real-time rates! [more gently] The app code SAVE2024 gives you a five dollar credit too.
740 [reassuringly] It's super user-friendly, I promise! [warmly] The app actually sends notifications before peak hours start. [more enthusiastically] Customers at addresses like yours typically save seventy-five dollars their first quarter!
741 [encouragingly] That's a great approach! [professionally] I'm noting on account K4M that you're enrolled in time-of-use education. [helpfully] You'll receive weekly tips too, starting this Friday, June 7th!
742 [laughing gently] They arrive at noon, don't worry! [more professionally] Is there anything else about your 1247 Maple Drive service I can help with? [warmly] Maybe our budget billing option?
743 [cheerfully] Absolutely, no problem at all! [warmly] You'll receive everything at slowpoke_77 within ten minutes. [professionally] Thank you for calling PowerGrid Energy, and remember—off-peak is your friend!
744 [professionally] I understand your concern. [quickly] Let me check our availability right away. [typing rapidly] What's Emma's date of birth and have you been seen here before?
745 [sympathetically] Oh, that sounds really difficult. [briskly] Unfortunately, Dr. Martinez is fully booked today, but [more hopefully] I do have a 3:45 PM slot with Dr. Chen tomorrow.
746 [reassuringly] Let me double-check for you. [quickly] Actually, there's been a cancellation—[more enthusiastically] Dr. Patel has a 2:30 opening this afternoon. Would that work?
747 [warmly] Perfect, I've got you scheduled. [efficiently] Now, has Emma had any fever, difficulty breathing, or [more seriously] is this cough accompanied by wheezing?
748 [professionally] I've noted all of that for the doctor. [quickly] Please arrive fifteen minutes early for paperwork, and [more gently] bring her insurance card and any medications she's currently taking.
749 [helpfully] Keep her hydrated and comfortable. [briskly] If the cough worsens significantly or she develops breathing difficulties, [more urgently] don't wait—go straight to the emergency room.
750 [reassuringly] That's a good sign she's still active. [efficiently] You'll be in our West Wing, suite 203. [cheerfully] Dr. Patel is wonderful with children, very patient.
751 [sympathetically] I completely understand, it's tough. [warmly] We see lots of tired parents here. [more briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with today?
752 [helpfully] Oh yes, definitely use our north entrance instead. [quickly] There's always spaces there, and [more enthusiastically] it's actually closer to the West Wing anyway.
753 [warmly] That's what we're here for. [professionally] So that's 2:30 PM with Dr. Patel, West Wing suite 203. [cheerfully] We'll see you and Emma this afternoon!
754 [Disappointed] So basically, when I said "cancel everything," I meant just the morning stuff, not the—not the whole entire project. [Sigh] [Slow] That's three months of work down the drain.
755 [Fast] Wait wait wait, you thought I was firing him? [Laugh] No, I said we should "inspire" him, not "fire" him—huge difference!
756 [Angry] I specifically texted "DON'T send it yet" but apparently autocorrect changed it to "DO send it" and now our biggest client thinks we're idiots. [Groan]
757 [Whisper] Between you and me, um, I kinda forgot to hit "reply all" so nobody else got the updated venue. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Two hundred people showed up at the wrong place.
758 [Sarcastic] Oh great, so when I said I'd handle the Smith account, everyone just assumed I meant, like, ALL the Smith accounts? [Slow] There's literally twelve of them.
759 [Happy] Actually, this is hilarious now—she thought I was proposing when I was just, uh, tying my shoe! [Chuckle] [Fast] The whole restaurant started clapping!
760 [Sad] I dunno how to fix this—I mean, telling your mom she looked "tired" apparently translates to something way worse. [Sigh]
761 [Shout] The email said THURSDAY! [Angry] But somehow everyone read it as Tuesday and I'm standing here with—with fifty pounds of potato salad and nobody to eat it!
762 [Slow] Y'know, in my defense, "sure, whatever" isn't exactly enthusiastic consent to, um, to sell the house. [Disappointed] [Tsk] How was I supposed to know you were serious?
763 [Fast] [Happy] Okay so this is actually kinda my fault—I texted him the wrong address but it worked out because that's where his ex lives and they're back together now! [Laugh]
764 [Whisper] I thought when you winked, that meant you were joking about the—about firing the entire department. [Sad] [Slow] Apparently you just had something in your eye.
765 [Sarcastic] Right, because "bring a dessert" obviously means bring seven hundred dollars worth of wedding cake. [Chuckle] My bad, totally misread that potluck invite.
766 [Angry] [Fast] Look, when someone says they're "fine," they're usually not fine, but I took you at your word and went golfing and now—now you're furious! [Groan]
767 [Disappointed] The translator app really let us down here—we ordered, like, uh, we ordered "a small coffee" and somehow got forty live chickens delivered. [Sigh]
768 [Shout] [Happy] No no no, I said I LOVE your haircut, not that it looks like a "bad nut"—the phone connection was terrible! [Laugh]
769 [Slow] [Sad] I honestly thought "space" meant, like, a weekend apart, not... not moving to Denver without telling me. [Sigh] That's on me for not clarifying, I guess.
770 [Fast] [Angry] The decimal point was in the wrong place so instead of ordering ten units we ordered ten thousand and—and the warehouse is literally overflowing! [Tsk]
771 [Whisper] So, er, turns out "surprise party" doesn't mean you're supposed to surprise the other planners too. [Disappointed] [Slow] We had three cakes and no decorations.
772 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, using the acronym "SOB" in my presentation really went over well—I meant "Start of Business" but everyone thought I was calling the client names! [Chuckle]
773 [Happy] She thought I hated the gift but I was actually crying because it was so perfect—my face just, uh, doesn't know how to do happy tears properly! [Laugh] [Slow] Took twenty minutes to convince her.
774 SCENARIO: Mad about a canceled flight, then sees they got upgraded to first class on the rebooking
775 Oh god, okay—I can explain. I know how this looks but it's not—it wasn't meant to be a big thing, I swear. He was literally just asking if you were coming to the party and I thought—
776 I thought it would help! Like, he was gonna pick you up anyway and he didn't know if you were home or—wait wait wait, that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] Um, basically he said he was worried about you.
777 You're right. You're totally right, I just—I dunno, I wasn't thinking? No that's—that's not an excuse either. I guess I just figured since you guys are friends it wouldn't be a big deal but obviously I should've asked first.
778 Oh. Oh shit, I didn't—I had no idea. God, that makes this so much worse. I'm such an idiot, I should've realized there was a reason he was asking me instead of just—[groan] I'm so sorry.
779 No! No no no, absolutely not. This was literally the only time and I—honestly I felt weird about it even when I did it but he seemed so concerned and I thought I was helping but clearly I wasn't thinking about—about boundaries and stuff.
780 I know. And I violated that and I—god, I feel terrible. Like genuinely awful about this whole thing. You trusted me with that information and I just... I betrayed that trust, didn't I?
781 Can I—is there any way I can fix this? I mean, I already told Jake to delete the screenshot and made him promise not to bother you but like—that's probably not enough, right? [sigh] I really wanna make this right somehow.
782 I know, I know. But maybe I can—okay this is gonna sound stupid but what if I give you my location? Like permanently? So you can see where I am whenever, y'know, as like a trust thing?
783 Right. Yeah, no, you're—you're absolutely right. I'm just grasping at straws here because I hate that I hurt you. Like this is eating me up inside and I don't—I don't wanna lose you as a friend over my stupid mistake.
784 I won't. I promise I won't, ever. And I'm—I'm really truly sorry. Thank you for even talking to me about this instead of just—y'know, cutting me off completely. That means a lot.
785 Wait wait wait—are you serious? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! Like, I knew you were getting close but holy shit, 100k? That's literally insane!
786 Your phone— [Laugh] okay that's actually hilarious. But like, how are you feeling? You must be—I mean, this is huge, right? You've been grinding at this for what, like three years?
787 Weird how? Like good weird or—actually no, I kinda get it. It's probably super overwhelming, huh? All those people just... watching you.
788 Okay but—but it is though? Like, you're gonna get that silver play button thingy! And honestly, the sponsorship opportunities must be— [Gasp] wait, have brands started reaching out already?
789 Toe spacers? I'm—no no no, that's too good. Please tell me you're considering it. Actually wait, what even is your audience demographic for that?
790 Not toe people— [Chuckle] okay yeah, fair point. But seriously though, like, you must have some decent offers too? This is when things really start taking off, y'know?
791 Which is—I mean, that's totally valid! You don't have to like, sell out or whatever. But um, you are gonna celebrate somehow, right? This is literally a massive milestone.
792 A large coffee. You—you absolute madman. No but really, we should—actually, you know what? Let me take you out for dinner or something. Like, proper dinner, not just pizza.
793 Okay okay, pizza then! But like, the fancy place with the wood-fired oven and the burrata and all that bougie stuff. Because honestly? You've worked your ass off for this.
794 Me? Make a scene? I would never—okay actually that's fair, but I promise I won't, like, announce it to the whole restaurant or anything. Maybe just our waiter. [Laugh] Kidding! Mostly.
795 Wait wait wait—Meridian House? Like the—oh my god, the one downtown with the whole waitlist situation? How did you even—actually, no, of course you got in. You're like, literally perfect for that place.
796 You don't—okay, um, can we just take a second here? Because this is kinda huge, right? Like people wait years for this. What's making you hesitate?
797 Oh. Oh wow, that's—[Exhale] yeah, that's real money. I mean, obviously you can afford it, but like... that's still a lot to just drop on a club, y'know?
798 Your dad—oh. Ohhhh, okay okay, now I'm getting it. This isn't really about the money, is it? It's the whole... family expectation thing?
799 Since you were—Jesus. That's like, that's a lot of pressure, babe. No wonder you're feeling weird about it. Have you, um, have you talked to him about maybe not wanting it? [Nervous laugh]
800 Right, no, stupid question. Your dad's not exactly Mr. Flexibility when it comes to tradition and stuff. But like—I dunno, what if you just tried it for a year? See how it feels?
801 A lot like—wait, like snobby? Or just, y'know, intense? Because honestly, you can handle intense. You literally run board meetings.
802 They collect—[Laugh] stop, are you being serious right now? That's actually hilarious. Like what, "my yacht's bigger than yours" kinda thing?
803 Ugh, yeah, that whole scene is just—I mean, it's so not you. You're like, you're real, y'know? But also... connections and whatever. Business stuff. Could be useful?
804 Of course he does. Look, I'm gonna—actually, you know what? Whatever you decide, it's the right choice. Because you're the one who's gotta show up there, not him. [Sigh] Just don't let him guilt you into it, okay?
805 Wait wait wait—are you serious? The one at—oh my god, the one you've been talking about for like, months? This is huge!
806 I'm literally—okay I'm gonna cry [Laugh] because you worked so hard for this. Like, remember when you almost didn't even apply? And now you actually got it!
807 No no no, this is—this is totally real, and you deserve every second of it. When do you start? Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna flip.
808 You told me first? That's—okay now I'm actually gonna cry. But like, are you excited? You seem kinda... I dunno, quiet about it?
809 Oh babe, that's so—that's completely normal though. Like, this is your dream job we're talking about. Of course you're scared! But also [Sigh] you're gonna be incredible.
810 Okay, um, can I be real with you for a sec? You're not gonna mess it up. You're like, the most prepared person I know. Remember how you basically memorized their entire company history?
811 No no, that was—that was dedicated. And they obviously saw that, right? They picked you out of, what, hundreds of applicants probably?
812 Three hundred and—[Gasp] okay that's insane! You beat out three hundred people! How are you not literally screaming right now?
813 Wait, you actually—that's amazing. I'm so proud of you for letting yourself feel it, y'know? Even if it was just for a minute.
814 Are you kidding? This is like—this is the best news I've heard all year. We're definitely celebrating, and I'm not taking no for an answer, okay?
815 SCENARIO: trying to remember if they locked the front door
816 [shaking voice] They're here, they're finally here! [Sobbing] I can hear them breaking through the door—we're going to make it out. [gasping] After three days in this nightmare, [whispered] someone finally found us.
817 [louder now] No, listen to those voices—that's SWAT protocol! [Choking sob] My brother's a cop, I know how they announce themselves. [weakly] We just have to stay down until they clear the room, okay?
818 [fierce whisper] Nothing's going wrong—we're both walking out! [Crying harder] You'll tell her yourself at bedtime tonight. [determined] Look at me, breathe with me, we're survivors. [softer] In and out, just like we practiced these past hours.
819 [urgent tone] That's our guys doing the shooting, not them! [reassuring] Cover your ears, it'll be over soon. [Sob breaking through] I'm so sorry I got you into this mess—this is all my fault.
820 [hopeful whisper] I can see boots—military boots through the smoke! [getting louder] Over here, we're over here behind the counter! [Ragged breathing] Two civilians, we're unarmed! [pleading] Please see us before you shoot, please!
821 [relieved crying] They see us, they're coming this way! [shakily] That officer is signaling to stay still. [Gasping sob] Look at his eyes—kind eyes, not like theirs. [whispered] We're really going home, aren't we?
822 [gently] Of course I'll stay, we're trauma bonded for life now. [Half-laughing, half-crying] We'll get matching therapists, maybe a support group. [serious tone] But first, let's let these heroes cut these damn ties off our wrists.
823 [emotional] You kept me sane when I wanted to give up. [gratefully] Every time you squeezed my hand, I remembered why to fight. [Shuddering breath] My kids need their mom, and you reminded me of that truth.
824 [overwhelmed] Can you stand? Here, lean on me like we practiced. [encouraging] One step, then another, just like we talked about. [Breaking down] The ambulance lights are so beautiful—red and blue never looked so good before.
825 [quietly joyful] Look at all those people cheering for us! [disbelief] We're on the news—we're the survivors they're talking about. [Shaky breath] Tomorrow we'll be statistics, but today we're miracles. [firmly] We lived when others didn't.
826 [professionally] Good morning, thank you for calling HealthFlex HSA support. [warmly] I'd be happy to help you with eligible expenses. [clarifying tone] Generally, gymnastics classes aren't covered unless there's a specific medical diagnosis and a letter of medical necessity from your physician.
827 [patiently] Essential oils typically aren't eligible expenses either, unless prescribed for a specific medical condition. [more helpfully] Do you have the receipt and prescription information? [gentle tone] We'd need documentation showing medical necessity for both items you've mentioned.
828 [diplomatically] Every situation is unique, and massage therapy can be eligible with proper documentation. [more firmly] For your March 15th purchase, I'd need to verify what specific items were bought. [reassuring] Can you log into your account or provide the itemized receipt?
829 [helpfully] No problem, I can look you up differently. [professional tone] Can you verify your date of birth and the last four digits of your social? [courteously] Once I access your account 4782-B9X, I can review your recent transactions.
830 [brightening] Yes, contact lenses are absolutely an eligible expense! [enthusiastically] That's one of the standard vision care items covered under HSA guidelines. [informatively] You just need to keep your receipt, and if it's prescription contacts, [cheerfully] you're all set—no additional documentation needed.
831 [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [quickly] Let me pull up your service history right away—I see here multiple visits for engine stalling. [more reassuring] We're going to get to the bottom of this today, I promise.
832 [calmly] I hear you, and you're absolutely right to be upset. [more firmly] Here's what we're going to do differently—our master technician will personally inspect it, not just run diagnostics. [briskly] No charge for today's inspection, obviously.
833 [quickly] You're right, he should have been involved earlier—that's on us. [more apologetically] Between you and me, we've had some staffing changes that affected our process. [reassuring] But John, our senior tech, he's been here fifteen years and knows these engines inside out.
834 [sympathetically] Oh no, that must have been terrifying for both of you. [more determined] I can't guarantee anything until John looks at it, but [briskly] here's what I can do—we'll provide a loaner car while we work on yours, no rental fees.
835 [quickly] John can see it this afternoon—should have answers by five. [more confidently] If it's something we've missed before, we'll make it right, including refunding previous repairs that didn't address the real issue. [firmly] That's my manager's commitment.
836 [briskly] Perfect, let me get you set up with that loaner right now. [reassuring] It's a newer model actually, fully insured by us. [more personally] And Mr. Johnson, I'm giving you my direct line—any issues, you call me personally.
837 [seriously] We absolutely know, and we value that relationship immensely. [more urgently] That's why I'm escalating this to regional management as well—they need to know we've let you down. [quickly] This isn't just about one car anymore.
838 [emphatically] Not at all, that's the bare minimum you deserve. [briskly] John just freed up—he can look at it in an hour actually. [more warmly] Would you like coffee while you wait, or should I have someone drive you home?
839 [indignantly] Your driving style? [quickly] That's completely inappropriate—engine stalling isn't user error. [more apologetically] I'm sorry you were told that, that's not how we should handle concerns, ever.
840 [confidently] One hour for initial assessment, yes, and I'm your point person from now on. [briskly] I'll text you updates as John works, so you're not left wondering. [warmly] We're going to make this right, Mr. Johnson.
841 [Disappointed] Um, okay so apparently the projector has decided to—yeah, it's just not gonna cooperate with us today. [Sigh]
842 [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, right when I get to the, uh, the most important slide, everything just goes black. [Tsk] Perfect timing, really.
843 [Happy] You know what, this is actually kinda refreshing—we can just, like, have a real conversation without all the PowerPoint stuff! [Chuckle]
844 [Fast] [Angry] I literally tested this three times this morning and it was—I don't understand why it's doing this now!
845 [Whisper] Can someone maybe, um, check if the cable in the back is—actually, never mind, I see the problem. [Slow]
846 [Shout] Does anyone here know how to—sorry, didn't mean to yell—does anyone know how to fix this thing? [Disappointed]
847 [Sad] I spent, like, two weeks preparing these visuals and now I'm just gonna have to wing it, I guess. [Sigh]
848 [Chuckle] Well, this brings back memories of presenting with, uh, with actual paper handouts, doesn't it? [Happy]
849 [Slow] [Disappointed] The irony is that my whole presentation is about, um, digital transformation and reliability.
850 [Fast] Okay everybody just—just give me thirty seconds, I'm gonna try rebooting the whole system real quick! [Angry]
851 [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Sure, let's all pretend this dramatic pause is totally intentional and part of my presentation strategy.
852 [Whisper] [Sad] I knew I should've brought backup slides on a USB or—or something, anything really.
853 [Happy] Actually, y'know what, forget the tech—let me just draw this out on the whiteboard old-school style! [Fast]
854 [Groan] This is literally the third time this month that this projector has—I mean, come on. [Disappointed] [Slow]
855 [Angry] [Fast] Who updated the software last night without telling anyone because this was working perfectly yesterday!
856 [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] I'd like to thank technology for keeping us all humble and, uh, reminding us who's really in charge here.
857 [Slow] So while we wait for this to—hopefully—come back to life, does anyone have any questions about what we've covered so far? [Disappointed]
858 [Sad] [Whisper] I can't believe this is happening at the quarterly review of all times—the CEO is literally right there.
859 [Laugh] [Happy] You know, my grandmother always said never trust anything you can't fix with a hammer!
860 [Tsk] [Fast] [Angry] Twenty minutes left and we're barely through the introduction because of this—this ridiculous equipment failure!
861 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly mentioning a mole removal they did themselves, then looking at it, then seeing it looks worse now, spiraling into DIY medical regret
862 Wait wait wait—what? Featured where? Oh my god, are you—are you serious right now? Like, featured featured?
863 Twenty thou— [Gasp] okay, okay I'm literally shaking for you right now. That's like—that's huge! Which one was it? The glowy one or the, um, the dramatic eye thing?
864 Stop it. The one you said was boring? The one you literally—oh my god, I told you! Didn't I tell you that one was, like, perfection?
865 I mean, yeah because it was—it was so good! And now look, twenty thousand people agree with me. Are the comments nice? Please tell me they're being nice.
866 Oh, come on. There's always gonna be those people who just—ugh, whatever. [Groan] They probably use their fingers for everything. Have brands reached out yet?
867 You haven't—babe, what? Why not? That could be like, that could be actual money! Or free stuff! Or—or both!
868 Okay but like—no no no, listen. Fun doesn't mean you can't also, y'know, benefit from it? You're talented. That's—that's literally why it got featured in the first place.
869 Different how? Like pressure different or like... scary different? Because honestly, both are kinda normal, right?
870 Oh god, parents and—and air quotes around influencer. [Laugh] Classic. But seriously though, you don't have to be anything. You can just... keep doing what you're doing, y'know?
871 That's my girl! And hey—if they're weird or pushy or whatever, we can just, like, roast them together over wine. But I'm telling you, this is—this is really cool. You should be proud.
872 Oh god. Oh no no no, I didn't—wait, let me explain what happened. We were just talking about weekend plans and somehow health stuff came up and I—I mentioned it without thinking, I'm so sorry.
873 I know, I know! You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm literally the worst friend. It just kinda slipped out when she was talking about her own stuff and I thought—no, I wasn't thinking, that's the problem.
874 You're right, you're completely right. I just—we were having coffee and she was being so open about her own anxiety and I got comfortable and... [groan] that's not an excuse. I shouldn't have said anything, period.
875 No! I mean—not decided, it wasn't like a conscious choice or anything. But that doesn't matter, right? The damage is done and I—I honestly don't know what's wrong with me sometimes. Like my mouth just goes before my brain catches up.
876 Wait, what? No, she wouldn't—she was actually really understanding about it. [nervous laugh] She said tons of people deal with the same thing and it doesn't change how she sees you at all, I promise.
877 Right. Yeah, no, you're—you're totally right. The point is I betrayed your trust and it wasn't my place to say anything regardless of how she reacted. I just... I wanna fix this so badly but I don't know how.
878 I know that. God, do I know that. But I—what else can I do, y'know? I already feel terrible and I've been beating myself up about it since yesterday. Should I talk to her? Try to explain that it was my fault for oversharing?
879 Okay. Okay, I won't. I just—I really need you to know that I get why you're mad. Like, if you'd told my boss something personal about me, I'd be furious too. [sigh] I completely violated your privacy.
880 I do, I really do. And I'm gonna—I mean, from now on, anything you tell me stays with me. No exceptions. I know that's what I should've been doing all along but... I'm gonna be better. I have to be better.
881 Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. I'm just—I'm really, truly sorry. And um, whenever you're ready to talk, if you wanna talk, I'll be here. However you need me to be.
882 Wait, you—you got what? Oh my god, wait wait wait, are you talking about the apartment? The one with the, um, the exposed brick and everything?
883 Shut UP! Are you—oh my god, I'm literally gonna cry right now [Laugh] This is huge! After all that stress with the other places falling through, you actually—you got it!
884 Okay okay, so like, when do you move? Have you told your landlord yet? God, I bet he's gonna be so pissed when you give notice.
885 End of the—that's like two weeks! Oh man, we gotta start packing, like, immediately. I can help! Actually wait, do you even have boxes? Because I've got a bunch from when I—
886 You haven't—wait, what? Why not? Is there something wrong with the lease or... [Sigh] please don't tell me you're getting cold feet about this.
887 Okay, no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. Remember how miserable you've been in that shoebox? With the neighbors and the, um, the weird smell in the hallway?
888 See? That's—exactly! And yeah, it's more money, but like, you got that raise, right? You can totally swing this. Plus you'll actually wanna, y'know, invite people over now.
889 It's not embarrass—okay it's a little embarrassing [Chuckle] but that's not your fault! That kitchen is literally from like 1982 or something.
890 Oh my god, that's—that's even worse than I thought. Babe, you deserve a place with, I dunno, a dishwasher? Counter space? Windows that actually open?
891 Right, like three inches. Super helpful in summer. Look, I'm just—I'm really really happy for you, okay? This is gonna be so good for you, I can just feel it.
892 Oh my god. Oh my god, I—I didn't know. Nobody told me, I swear I would've been there if I'd known. Is she okay? Is she—wait, when was this?
893 Tuesday? That's—oh no. No no no, that was the day my phone died at work and I didn't—I didn't charge it until like midnight because I just crashed when I got home. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot.
894 I mean it though, I literally had no idea. If I'd gotten your calls I would've dropped everything, you know that right? Like, you gotta know I would never just ignore you when something like that—when you needed me.
895 I know. I know and I—honestly, I don't even know what to say except I'm sorry. That's not enough, I get that, but I am so, so sorry. How is she now? Your mom?
896 Okay, I deserve that. I do. But can we just—[sigh] I'm trying here, alright? I messed up, I should've had my phone on, I should've been reachable. I just... I wanna make this right somehow.
897 Eight hours? Jesus. That must've been—I can't even imagine how scary that was. And lonely. God, I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? Like actually the worst.
898 I know you did. And I—the thing is, I've been there for you before, right? Remember when your dad had his surgery? Or when you got laid off? I was—I mean, I'm not trying to make excuses but—
899 No, you're right. You're totally right, it was different and I—I failed you. Plain and simple. I failed you when it mattered most and that's gonna eat at me for a really long time. Probably forever, honestly.
900 She did? Your mom asked about me? [quieter] Now I feel even worse. Um, would it—would it be okay if I visited her? Brought flowers or something? I dunno, whatever she likes. Those magazines she reads?
901 Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—I really am sorry. And I'm gonna keep my phone charged from now on, like religiously. Whatever you decide, just... know that I'm here now, okay? If that still means anything.
902 I know, I know—okay, that looks bad. But they were literally at my place when you texted and they heard me talking about coming over and I couldn't just—I mean, what was I supposed to say? "Sorry guys, you can't come"?
903 Right, yeah, I—I should've done that. You're right. I just... they were so excited and I'm really bad at saying no to people, you know? Like, really bad. [nervous laugh] Which is not an excuse, I'm just—I'm trying to explain what happened.
904 Oh god, the food—I didn't even think about that. I'm so sorry. We can—we can order something? I'll pay for everything, obviously. Pizza or Chinese or whatever you want. I've got my phone right here, just tell me what sounds good.
905 No no no, you're right, it's not about the food. It's about—I violated your space, basically. Your home. Without asking. [Sigh] And that's... that's really messed up of me, honestly.
906 I know you did. And instead you got—god, Tyler was so loud, wasn't he? I kept trying to get him to dial it down but he just... doesn't have an indoor voice, apparently. I should've—I should've just left when I saw how uncomfortable you were.
907 Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That's like—that's basic courtesy, right? Just basic human decency to ask before bringing a whole crew to someone's house. I don't—I don't know why I thought it would be fine. Actually, no, I didn't think. That's the problem. [quieter] I just didn't think at all.
908 That's—okay, that's fair. I mean, it hurts, but it's fair. I do this thing where I just... assume everything will work out? And I don't consider how it affects other people. My therapist literally talked to me about this last week. I'm working on it, I swear.
909 No, it's not. Remember your birthday dinner? When I brought my cousin? And that time at the movies... [Groan] Oh my god, I really do have a pattern, don't I? I'm—I'm that friend. The one who doesn't respect boundaries.
910 You're right to be mad. Like, genuinely, I would be furious if someone kept doing this to me. I don't—I don't wanna be that person anymore, okay? The one who makes you feel like your needs don't matter. Because they do. They really, really do matter to me.
911 I will. I mean—I want to. No, I will. Next time, I'll ask. Every time, actually. Even if it seems obvious that it's okay, I'll check with you first. And if I slip up, you can—you can call me out immediately. I wanna do better. For real this time.
912 SCENARIO: trying to decide which streaming service has the show they want
913 [panicked] The timer—it's stuck at thirty seconds! [voice rising] It hasn't moved for the past minute, which means— [Sharp intake of breath] Oh god, the real bomb must be somewhere else entirely in this building.
914 [frantic whisper] Listen carefully—no ticking. [louder] Real bombs tick, this one's completely silent! [Gasping] We need to evacuate everyone now, but which floor? The basement? The roof? Where would you hide it?
915 [defeated tone] Twenty-three minutes we've wasted on this fake. [angrier] Twenty-three minutes! [Bitter laugh] Their psychological warfare worked perfectly—we fell for the obvious decoy while the real threat lurks somewhere we haven't even checked yet.
916 [shaking voice] My phone's dead. [more steadily] The EMP from earlier must have— wait, yours too? [Horrified whisper] They planned this perfectly, cutting our communications before we even realized we'd been played.
917 [hollow voice] What if there isn't another bomb? [building intensity] What if making us panic and evacuate was the plan? [Dry chuckle] Create chaos, clear the building, then their real team moves in for whatever they're actually after.
918 [wavering] You're right, I just— [steadier] The ambassador's suite is on the seventh floor. [Quick exhale] If this is an assassination attempt disguised as a bombing, that's where they'd strike during an evacuation.
919 [exhausted] How did we miss this? [self-reproaching] Years of training, all those simulations, and we fell for a timer made of Christmas lights and duct tape. [Weak laugh] My instructor would be so disappointed right now.
920 [determined] Give me your knife. [hurried] If we can't call for help, we improvise—cut the main power, trigger the backup generators. [Grunt] The fifteen-second blackout might buy us time to reach the ambassador first.
921 [breathless running] Third floor clear! [shouting back] Fourth floor has fresh plaster on the east wall though! [Panting] Could be nothing, could be where they broke through from the adjacent building last night!
922 [stunned silence] Four minutes. [building panic] The kitchen is directly below the conference room where everyone's gathering for evacuation! [Desperate shout] We need to get three hundred people out of there right now!
923 [cheerfully] Congratulations on your new arrival! [reassuring] Don't worry, this is perfectly normal. [in a professional tone] I'll help you through everything—can you first provide me your member ID? [slower] It should be on your insurance card, starts with XHP, followed by nine digits.
924 [patiently] That's your member ID, perfect! [upbeat] Now, regarding the Social Security number—you have 30 days from birth to add her without it. [more formally] I'll need the baby's full legal name, birth weight, and the hospital where she was born. [gently] Also, was this your first child?
925 [laughing softly] You're absolutely fine, plenty of time left! [typing sounds] Valley Medical Center at 2847 Oakwood Drive, correct? [professionally] Now, for coverage to begin retroactively from November 14th, I'll need to verify your current plan. [questioning] Are you on the PPO-500 or the HMO-250?
926 [sympathetically] Excellent choice for growing families! [businesslike] Adding Emma will increase your monthly premium by $287.50, effective immediately. [carefully] Your new family deductible becomes $3,000 instead of $2,000. [helpfully] Would you like to keep the same pediatrician network, or explore our extended care options?
927 [reassuringly] Temporary cards will be emailed within 24 hours to your address on file. [checking] That's still jacob.richardson at techflow dot com, correct? [efficiently] Physical cards arrive in 7-10 business days to 458 Maple Street, Apartment 3B. [warmly] Emma's member ID will be XHP-4-7-2-8-3-9-0-1-6-D for dependent.
928 [laughing] That's a common question! [informatively] Vision coverage for infants includes important screenings starting at six months. [professionally] Adding her to dental costs $12 monthly, vision is $8.50. [kindly] Most parents add both for peace of mind—shall I include those as well?
929 [warmly] Actually $308, but who's counting? [chuckles] You're all set—Emma Grace Richardson is now fully covered. [officially] Your confirmation number is BCN-2024-11-20-7743A. [helpfully] Is there anything else regarding the coverage I can help clarify?
930 [understanding] The confirmation number is BCN-2024-11-20-7743A, correct! [explaining] For prescriptions, Emma uses the same pharmacy benefits as you. [specifically] Your Pharmacy ID is RX-9982-RICH, copays are $10 generic, $30 brand name. [reassuringly] Most infant medications are covered at the generic rate.
931 [sympathetically] Completely normal to worry! [calmly] ER visits have a $250 copay, waived if admitted. [informatively] However, your plan includes a 24/7 nurse hotline—888-NURSE-01. [encouragingly] They're wonderful with new parent concerns and can save you those 3 AM panic drives!
932 [pleased] That's so kind of you! [warmly] I'm Sarah, employee ID S-4472. [professionally] You should receive a survey email within 48 hours. [cheerfully] Congratulations again on baby Emma, and remember—[reassuringly] we're here 24/7 if you need anything else!
933 [professionally] Good afternoon, how can I help you today? [warmly] I see you're here about a deposit—let me pull up your account information for you.
934 [calmly] I understand your frustration, sir. [quickly] Let me check the details of that deposit—ah, I see it's a $3,500 check from an out-of-state account, which triggers our standard five-business-day hold policy.
935 [apologetically] I'm sorry for the confusion—the teller should have mentioned the hold period. [more quickly] However, I can see you've been a customer for... six years, so [optimistically] let me speak with my manager about a partial release.
936 [firmly] Unfortunately, I don't have authority to fully override holds over $2,500. [reassuringly] But wait—I can release $1,200 immediately, [briskly] and the rest will clear tomorrow morning at 9 AM.
937 [confidently] Yes sir, I'm marking it in the system right now. [more quickly] The remaining $2,300 will be available tomorrow—I'm actually expediting it from the original hold date. [earnestly] Would you like that in writing?
938 [briskly] Absolutely, the $1,200 is available immediately—cash or cashier's check? [helpfully] I'll print the hold release documentation while you decide.
939 [quickly] It's a federal regulation thing—basically fraud prevention for large deposits. [more conversationally] Out-of-state checks need extra verification time, but [reassuringly] your history with us helped me reduce the hold.
940 [sympathetically] I completely understand, and I'll make a note about the communication issue. [professionally] Here's your release form, and [briskly] let me count out your twelve hundred for you.
941 [quickly] ATM, mobile app, in branch—any method works after 9 AM. [cheerfully] The system updates overnight, so you'll see the full balance available first thing.
942 [professionally] I'm glad I could help resolve this for you. [sincerely] And here's your cash—twelve hundred exactly, [quickly] would you like an envelope for that?
943 [Whisper] Hey, um, are you—are you even breathing under there? [Laugh] I can't tell if you're sleeping or literally hibernating at this point.
944 [Shout] Fire! There's a—okay, not really, but seriously, you gotta get up now! [Fast] We're gonna be so late!
945 [Disappointed] I made your favorite breakfast and everything, y'know? [Sigh] The pancakes are getting cold and I just—whatever, I guess.
946 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, just keep sleeping while the world, like, literally ends outside. [Tsk] That's totally fine, no big deal.
947 [Happy] Guess what—your package finally came! [Fast] The one you've been waiting for since, um, forever ago! Still nothing? Really?
948 [Angry] This is the third time this week I've had to—ugh, I'm so done with this! [Groan] Wake up already!
949 [Slow] You know, I kinda envy you right now. [Chuckle] Being able to just, like, completely tune everything out like that.
950 [Sad] I really need to talk to someone and you're just—I mean, I know you're tired but... [Sigh]
951 [Fast] Okay so basically your boss called twice and your mom once and I dunno what to tell them anymore! [Angry]
952 [Whisper] I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna pour water on you. [Slow] Don't say I didn't warn you, okay?
953 [Disappointed] We were supposed to leave an hour ago for the—actually, forget it. [Tsk] I'll just go by myself, I guess.
954 [Sarcastic] Hello? Earth to sleeping beauty? [Laugh] Your snoring is literally shaking the walls, just so you know.
955 [Happy] The dog got into the trash again and it's everywhere but honestly it's kinda hilarious! [Chuckle] You're missing all the fun!
956 [Shout] Your alarm has been going off for—wait, let me count—twenty-seven minutes! [Groan] How are you not hearing this?
957 [Sad] I had that nightmare again and I just—I really don't wanna be alone right now. [Whisper] Please wake up?
958 [Fast] Your phone keeps buzzing and I think it's important but I can't answer it 'cause it's locked! [Disappointed]
959 [Angry] You promised—you literally promised you'd drive me this morning! [Slow] And here we are, same situation as always.
960 [Sarcastic] No no, it's fine, I'll just, um, cancel our reservations that I made three weeks ago. [Tsk] Super cool.
961 [Whisper] There's something moving in the kitchen and I'm kinda freaked out. [Fast] Could you maybe—actually, never mind, I'll handle it myself.
962 [Happy] Oh my god, it's snowing! [Shout] Like, actually snowing for the first time in forever! You gotta see this!
963 SCENARIO: Casually talking about a skincare product they've been using, then reading ingredients, then finding something they're allergic to that explains recent issues, spiraling into self-inflicted frustration
964 Doing—doing what? I literally don't know what you're talking about. You've been weird with me all week and now you're acting like I'm supposed to read your mind or something.
965 Okay, wait wait wait. [scoff] You're seriously gonna call ME out for not being direct? That's—wow, that's rich coming from you. You've been giving me the silent treatment for days.
966 I'm not—ugh, I'm not pretending anything! Maybe I made a couple comments, fine, but it's kinda hard to talk to you when you shut down every conversation before it even starts, y'know?
967 Oh, like you do? When have you ever—honestly, when have you ever just come out and said what's bothering you? [frustrated laugh] Instead of making me guess what I did wrong this time?
968 That's not—okay okay, that came out wrong. But I mean, come on, you gotta admit you don't exactly make it easy to have real conversations about stuff.
969 Maybe not, but at least I try to—look, I'm sorry if some things I said came off wrong, alright? But I dunno how else to deal with it when you won't actually talk to me.
970 I am being—[sigh] Fine. You wanna know what's honest? I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated that you expect me to be perfectly direct when you literally ice me out the second something goes wrong.
971 Yeah, maybe I do! Because what else am I supposed to—you don't give me any other option. It's like, either I pretend nothing's wrong or I'm the bad guy for trying to bring it up sideways.
972 Okay but—that's exactly what I'm trying to tell you. I don't know HOW to just say it outright. That's not—some of us weren't raised that way, y'know? It feels confrontational and scary and—whatever, you wouldn't get it.
973 I just... I guess I'm disappointed that we can't seem to—that neither of us can figure out how to actually communicate. And yeah, I'm sorry for being passive aggressive, I am, but I need you to meet me halfway here.
974 SCENARIO: waiting for test results online
975 [panicked] Did you get the alert? [voice rising] They're saying the school's on lockdown! [Sharp intake of breath] I can't reach Emma's teacher—the phones must be jammed or something. This can't be happening right now.
976 [forcefully] I'm already in my car! [shaky breath] The Facebook parent group is going crazy but nobody knows anything real. [quieter] What if it's... you know... [trailing off] I can't even think about it right now.
977 [barely audible] They did that drill last month, remember? [more steadily] The kids know to hide in the reading corner. [voice breaking] Emma was so scared after that drill—said her stomach hurt for days. God, she must be terrified.
978 [quivering] I see them too—counting at least eight patrol cars from here. [steadier] Wait, someone's posting that it might be a false alarm? [hopeful rise] Something about a suspicious person but no weapon seen? Is that real?
979 [gentle tone] Hey, breathe with me, okay? [more firmly] Our kids are strong and the teachers are trained. [reassuring] Look—the news van just got here, so maybe we'll get real information soon instead of all these rumors.
980 [defensive] You told him the right thing! [softer] Schools ARE safe—this is probably nothing. [strained] Remember last year's lockdown at Jefferson? [more hopefully] Turned out someone just saw a maintenance worker they didn't recognize carrying tools.
981 [urgently] Wait, look at your phone! [excited] The district just sent another alert! [reading slowly] "Lockdown lifted—all students and staff are safe." [Relieved sob] Oh thank God, thank God! They're safe! Our babies are safe!
982 [determined] Come on, let's go together! [rushed words] We'll take my van—it's bigger and I'm parked closer. [warmly] I want to hug Emma so tight she complains. I'm never letting her out of my sight again.
983 [laughing weakly] Ice cream for dinner, even. [serious tone] And we're going to have to talk to them about this. [sighing deeply] How do you even explain this to a seven-year-old? The world is so messed up sometimes.
984 [firmly] Absolutely. [getting louder] And I want answers about what actually happened! [controlled anger] This better not have been some stupid false alarm because someone got spooked. [softer] Our kids don't deserve this trauma for nothing.
985 [professionally concerned] I'm so sorry to hear about your experience, Mr...? [apologetic] If you could provide your booking reference—it should start with RCL or NCL—I can pull up your reservation immediately.
986 [calmly] Mr. Peterson, I see your reservation here for the March 15th sailing. [sympathetically] According to our records, we did have a gastrointestinal situation affecting approximately 2.3% of passengers. [carefully] Were medical forms filed?
987 [more firmly] I understand your frustration completely. [measured tone] Our protocol requires us to report when cases exceed 3% to the CDC at 1-800-CDC-INFO. [reassuringly] We can certainly discuss compensation options.
988 [patiently] Mr. Peterson, I can escalate this to our Guest Relations Manager. [more warmly] Would you prefer a refund to your original payment method ending in 4782, or... or perhaps onboard credit totaling $2,500?
989 [thoughtfully] Let me review case number GR-2024-88453 with my supervisor. [hopeful tone] I can authorize up to 50% immediately—$4,200—plus full medical reimbursement. [professionally] Would that be acceptable?
990 [understanding] Absolutely, the port excursions should be refunded separately through Shore-Ex department. [helpfully] I'm adding note EX-REFUND-PRIORITY to your file now. [more confidently] They'll process within 7-10 business days.
991 [empathetically] As a parent myself, I truly understand, Mr. Peterson. [gently] While I can't put a price on that experience, I can offer our Executive Response package—65% refund plus $1,000 future cruise credit.
992 [relieved] Excellent, I'll send the agreement to that email immediately. [professionally] Your confirmation number is EXEC-COMP-77234-B. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help resolve today, Mr. Peterson?
993 [concerned] That's extremely valuable information, thank you. [more seriously] I'm forwarding this to our Health Services at health.report@cruiseline.com immediately. [firmly] Photos can be uploaded to case number HS-9982-REVIEW.
994 [confirming] That's correct, 4429 Oceanview Drive, Houston, 77024. [reassuringly] Mr. Peterson, you'll receive everything within 14 days, and my direct line is 1-888-555-7823 extension 445. [sincerely] Again, our deepest apologies.
995 [professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling Premium Insurance Solutions. [more quickly] My name is Sandra, and I'll be assisting you today with your claim. [briskly] Can I have your claim number and policy details, please?
996 [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr... [pause] let me just pull that up. [more quickly] Johnson, right? [reassuringly] I see here your claim was submitted on the fifteenth, and it appears to be in our review department still.
997 [sympathetically] I can definitely see why that would be difficult. [more briskly] Let me check with—actually, I'm seeing a note here. [quickly] Your adjuster attempted to contact you twice last week but couldn't reach you?
998 [cautiously] The number we have on file ends in 3847. [more quickly] Is that still current? [pause] Because if not, that would explain the disconnect, and we can update it right away to expedite everything.
999 [apologetically] I'm so sorry about that confusion. [more efficiently] Let me update that immediately—what's the best number? [reassuringly] I'll also flag this for priority review, and personally ensure the adjuster calls you within twenty-four hours.
1000 [quickly] Got it, 555-9821, updating now. [more sympathetically] About the rental coverage—let me see what I can do. [briskly] Sometimes we can extend it in cases where there's been a communication error on our end.
1001 [professionally] Based on what I'm seeing, and with the priority flag I'm adding... [more specifically] you should hear from adjuster Williams by tomorrow afternoon. [quickly] The actual payout, once approved, typically takes three to five business days after that.
1002 [confidently] I'm putting a personal note in the system right now. [more quickly] If Williams doesn't call by 3 PM tomorrow, I want you to call back and ask for me directly—Sandra, extension 4021. [firmly] We'll get this sorted.
1003 [warmly] Of course, Mr. Johnson. [more efficiently] I've also sent you an email confirmation with all these details and your updated contact info. [reassuringly] Is there anything else I can help clarify about the claim process today?
1004 [quickly] You can absolutely use your own mechanic. [more specifically] You'll just need to submit the estimate for approval first, but that usually only takes a day. [briskly] I'll make a note about your preference in the file right now.
1005 [Disappointed] Wait, wait, wait—I'm patting all my pockets and it's just... it's not here. [Sigh] I literally had it this morning.
1006 [Fast] Oh god, um, do you take Venmo or like—actually, can someone spot me? [Nervous laugh] This is so embarrassing.
1007 [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Groan] I drove all the way here and I gotta go back for a stupid piece of leather?
1008 [Whisper] Hey, psst—I kinda need you to, uh, cover this for me. [Fast] I'll pay you back, I swear.
1009 [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, really, this is just—this is exactly what I needed today. [Tsk] Perfect timing as always.
1010 [Slow] You know what? I'm gonna take this as a sign from the universe that I shouldn't buy this. [Chuckle]
1011 [Shout] No, no, NO! [Disappointed] I can't believe I—the one time I actually need cash!
1012 [Happy] Honestly? Kind of relieved I can't impulse buy that jacket now. [Laugh] My bank account thanks me, I guess.
1013 [Sad] I just, um... I really wanted to treat you to lunch for once, y'know? [Sigh] And now I can't even do that.
1014 [Fast] [Angry] This is the third time this month—the THIRD time I've done this exact same thing!
1015 [Whisper] [Slow] So, uh, funny story... remember when I said I had everything under control?
1016 [Disappointed] I literally put it right by my keys so I wouldn't—but here we are. [Tsk] [Sigh] Classic me.
1017 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, let me just magically produce money from thin air, that's definitely how this works.
1018 [Happy] Wait, actually—I think I left twenty bucks in my gym bag! [Fast] Hold on, lemme check the car!
1019 [Shout] [Angry] I HAD IT! I literally—I remember putting it down when I grabbed my phone and then... nothing.
1020 [Sad] [Slow] Great, now everyone's waiting on me and I'm just... I'm that person holding up the line.
1021 [Chuckle] You wanna know something stupid? I have like four backup wallets at home—fat lot of good they're doing me. [Disappointed]
1022 [Whisper] Don't make a big deal about it, but, um, I'm gonna need to borrow your card. [Fast] I'll Zelle you right now, okay?
1023 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh this is rich—I lecture my kids about being responsible and look at me now.
1024 [Happy] Actually, y'know what? Forget it—let's just go do something free instead. [Laugh] [Fast] When's the last time we just walked around the park anyway?
1025 SCENARIO: Excited about a job offer, then worried about the commute, then finding out it's mostly remote
1026 Okay, wait—that's not—I didn't uninvite you exactly. The venue changed and they literally cut our numbers in half. I had to—everyone had to make cuts.
1027 That's not true and you know it. I had to cut like eight people, not just you. My cousin's not even coming anymore. [scoff] You're making it sound like I specifically targeted you or something.
1028 Look, I—yeah, okay, you made the list. But it wasn't personal. I had to think about who absolutely had to be there, like family obligations and—I mean, you get that, right?
1029 You are important! Jesus, that's not—this isn't about how important you are to me. It's about having to make impossible choices when the venue literally [frustrated laugh] screwed us over last minute.
1030 Don't—don't do that. Don't just say "right" like that. I'm trying to explain what happened here. You think I wanted to make these calls? You think this was fun for me?
1031 Of course I—what kind of question is that? Of course I hesitated. I went back and forth on the list like fifty times. But somebody had to get cut, okay? Somebody always has to get cut.
1032 Oh come on, that's—that's completely unfair. When have I ever excluded you from anything before? Name one time. [sigh] You're acting like there's some pattern here when there isn't.
1033 Sarah's—okay, Sarah's been helping me plan this thing for six months. She literally put down deposits. I couldn't just—what was I supposed to do there? I get that you're hurt but—
1034 It's clearly not fine. Look look, I know I handled this badly, alright? I should've called you sooner, explained better, I just—I dunno, I was stressed and making a million decisions and I screwed up the delivery.
1035 Yeah, I did. And I'm—I'm sorry you're hurt about it, I really am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I was in an impossible situation here. Like, there was no good option.
1036 I know, I know—look, you said you needed time to process everything, so I was trying to respect that. I didn't wanna be that friend who like, doesn't know when to back off.
1037 Okay but you—you literally said "I need space right now" and then you stopped responding to the group chat, so what was I supposed to think? [Sigh] I was trying to do the right thing here.
1038 That's not—come on, that's not fair. Every time I've tried to give you space before, you got mad that I wasn't persistent enough. Now I actually listen and somehow that's wrong too?
1039 How? How was I supposed to know that? I'm not a mind reader—I can't just magically know when "I need space" means [frustrated laugh] "please still check on me" versus when it actually means space.
1040 Oh, great. Great. So now I'm the only terrible friend who didn't crack your code? That's—honestly, that's kinda unfair. I was literally trying to respect what you asked for.
1041 I almost did! Like five times, actually. But then I'd remember how you—remember last year when your dad was sick? You said you needed space and I kept texting anyway and you got so pissed at me for not listening.
1042 Do I? Because from where I'm sitting, it feels like I can't win. I check in, I'm being pushy. I don't check in, I'm a bad friend who doesn't care. [Scoff] Like, what do you want from me?
1043 That's—okay, that's not even—I do care. Obviously I care. But you're acting like I just forgot about you or something when I was literally thinking about you every day, wondering if I should reach out or if that would make things worse.
1044 No. I didn't. And maybe—maybe that was wrong, fine. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're making me the villain here when I was genuinely trying to give you what I thought you needed.
1045 And I'm—look, I'm sorry I misread it, okay? I am. But I need you to understand that I wasn't just being lazy or not caring. I was scared of making it worse. That's gotta count for something.
1046 SCENARIO: attempting to catch a fly in their apartment
1047 [deadpan] Welcome to coffee purgatory, where decisions go to die. [drawn-out] What can I get started for you today? [Sigh] Or should I just brew everything while you contemplate the meaning of espresso versus americano?
1048 [sarcastically sweet] Oat milk is fantastic in everything, just like indecision. [slower] So that's one maybe-iced-possibly-cappuccino-but-could-be-latte. [Sharp exhale] What size would you like to be uncertain about—small, medium, or existentially large?
1049 [monotone] Physics says yes, ice dilutes things. [perky] Congratulations on discovering water! [back to deadpan] Would you like me to explain how temperature works, or can we move on to the seventeen syrup flavors you'll panic about?
1050 [impressed whistle] Someone's been on coffee Reddit. [patronizing] A dry cappuccino has more foam, less milk—like my patience right now. [brightening falsely] Wet has more milk. Pick your moisture level, coffee philosopher.
1051 [dryly] You became that customer three minutes ago. [reassuring] But hey, at least you're self-aware about it. [teasing] So one medium, dry, oat milk cappuccino. [Pause] Any flavoring to overthink?
1052 [slowly] Nothing it is. [amused] That only took four flavor rejections. [matter-of-fact] Would you like whipped cream on your dry cappuccino that specifically has less milk but somehow might need whipped dairy?
1053 [philosophical] Pastries transcend beverage boundaries. [sarcastic wonder] They're the universal constant of cafes. [lowering voice] But let me guess—you'll need twenty minutes to choose between croissant and muffin?
1054 [fake sympathy] Poor thing, defeated by French baked goods. [efficient] So that's one medium dry oat cappuccino, no flavor, no pastry, [slower] no joy. That'll be five-fifty and years off my life.
1055 [weary] Cards work fine. [brightening] Tips are for bartenders and therapists, and [chuckling] I'm apparently both today. [genuine] Twenty percent would be lovely, unlike this entire interaction.
1056 [warming up] Grunting is actually our preferred ordering method. [friendly now] Look, your drink'll be great. [reassuring] Even indecisive people deserve good coffee. [calling out] One overcomplicated cappuccino, coming up!
1057 [furious] Are you KIDDING me right now?! [shouting] My account ID JX4829-B just got banned for absolutely no reason! [incredulous] I've been a premium member since 2018, spent over $3,400 on your platform, and this is how you treat loyal customers?!
1058 [sarcastically] Oh please, what violations exactly? [getting louder] Playing the game too well?! [scoffs] I never received ANY emails—maybe check if your system actually works before destroying people's accounts!
1059 [outraged] AUTOMATED SOFTWARE?! [laughs bitterly] That's my work VPN, you incompetent— [groans] I'm a network engineer, order number #78234KL proves I bought your VIP package legitimately last month!
1060 [mockingly] Oh wow, 7-10 days while my $200 tournament entry fee just vanishes? [exasperated] This is going viral—screenshot saved, timestamp 3:47 PM. [angrily] Forty-two thousand followers are about to hear about this disaster!
1061 [incredulous] Harassment?! [shouting louder] YOU stole my account worth $3,400! [chuckles darkly] My lawyer's already drafting the small claims filing for case #2024-SC-9823, so maybe... maybe you should expedite that review yourselves.
1062 [professionally] Good afternoon, thanks for contacting us today. [quickly] I see you're reaching out about order number 78432. [more warmly] How can I help you with that?
1063 [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, and I'm so sorry about this delay. [briskly] Let me just... pull up your order details right now. [reassuring] We'll get this sorted out for you immediately, I promise.
1064 [concerned] Oh no, a birthday party—that's, that's really important. [speaking faster] I can see here the package got stuck at our distribution center due to some unexpected weather delays. [more firmly] But I'm escalating this right now to our priority team.
1065 [quickly] Absolutely, yes, the shipping refund is already being processed as we speak. [hesitant] For tomorrow delivery, I'm... I'm checking our express options now. [more confidently] Actually, yes, I can upgrade you to our morning courier service at no charge.
1066 [earnestly] The morning courier has a 99.8% success rate, genuinely. [rapidly] They'll deliver between 8 and 10 AM, you'll get tracking updates every hour, and—here's my direct extension if anything goes wrong. [softer] We really don't want to ruin your daughter's special day.
1067 [briskly] It's extension 4521, and my name is Marcus. [reassuring] I've added a note to personally monitor your shipment first thing tomorrow. [cheerfully] Also, I'm adding a 20% discount code to your account for the inconvenience.
1068 [warmly] Hey, no apology necessary—I'm a parent too. [sympathetically] Birthday parties are stressful enough without shipping disasters. [quickly] I've just sent you an email confirmation with all the updated details and my direct line.
1069 [honestly] It was an unusual situation—flooding at the facility, actually. [rapidly] Not in your area, but at our hub two states over. [more positively] We've already rerouted everything, so future orders won't have this issue.
1070 [enthusiastically] Oh, unicorns are the best! [quickly] My daughter just had one last month. [brightly] I'm noting that in your file so our courier knows it's extra special—they sometimes add a birthday sticker to packages like these.
1071 [chuckling] Well, I appreciate that! [sincerely] But seriously, if anything seems off with tomorrow's delivery, don't hesitate—call me directly. [warmly] I'll be in from 7 AM just to make sure everything goes smoothly.
1072 [Happy] So the nurse today, she was telling me about her cat who apparently steals socks—I dunno, it just made me laugh. [Chuckle]
1073 [Sarcastic] Oh yeah, losing my hair is, uh, totally the new fashion statement I was going for. [Tsk] [Slow] Very avant-garde, right?
1074 [Whisper] Sometimes at three AM, I kinda just lie here and think—wait, is that weird? [Fast] I mean, the quiet helps me process everything.
1075 [Disappointed] I was gonna make it to Sarah's wedding, but now I'm—I'm not so sure my body's gonna cooperate. [Sigh]
1076 [Happy] [Fast] My oncologist said the numbers are actually looking better than expected, so that's, y'know, that's something to celebrate!
1077 [Angry] Why do people keep saying "stay strong" like I have a—like there's another option here? [Groan]
1078 [Slow] The thing about chemo brain is, um, you forget what you were gonna—what was I saying? [Chuckle] [Sad] See, there it goes again.
1079 [Shout] I actually kept down an entire meal today! [Happy] [Laugh] Take that, nausea!
1080 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, let's add another pill to the collection—I'm basically a walking pharmacy at this point, what's one more?
1081 [Sad] My kids are trying so hard to be brave, but I can see they're—they're scared, y'know? [Whisper] And honestly, me too.
1082 [Happy] This wig is kinda fun actually—I've always wanted to try being a redhead! [Chuckle] [Fast] Maybe I'll get a blue one next.
1083 [Disappointed] [Slow] I used to run marathons, and now walking to the mailbox is like—it's an achievement, I guess.
1084 [Angry] [Shout] Can everyone please stop tiptoeing around me like I'm made of glass?! [Sigh] I'm sick, not broken!
1085 [Whisper] You wanna know something funny? [Happy] The hospital jello actually tastes pretty good when you can't taste anything else properly.
1086 [Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, another person wants to tell me about their aunt's cousin who beat cancer with, uh, positive thinking and kale smoothies.
1087 [Sad] [Slow] Some days are harder than—I mean, yesterday was okay, but today I just... [Sigh] Tomorrow will be different.
1088 [Happy] My support group is literally the best—we call ourselves the "Chemo Warriors" and honestly, it's so cheesy but I love it! [Laugh]
1089 [Angry] The insurance company is being absolutely—ugh, I can't even deal with their bureaucratic nonsense right now. [Groan] [Fast] Like I don't have enough to worry about?
1090 [Whisper] [Disappointed] I keep having these dreams where I'm completely healthy and then I wake up and remember—yeah.
1091 [Slow] It's weird how cancer makes you appreciate stupid little things like, um, like keeping ice cream down or having energy to shower. [Chuckle] [Happy] Small victories, right?
1092 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly talking about a ride share they took, then checking their rating, then seeing it dropped significantly recently, spiraling into confusion and self-consciousness about what they did
1093 Oh the—wait, the one you were working on? The denim one with all the, um, the embroidery stuff?
1094 I'm sorry—twelve? Twelve HUNDRED? [Gasp] Are you actually serious right now? That's like—wait wait wait, you bought that for what, twenty bucks?
1095 Fifteen dollars and you just—okay, okay I need to sit down. That's literally insane profit margins, like that's what, almost eighty times what you paid?
1096 And you're just—you're so calm about this! I'd be like, screaming, honestly. How long did it even take you to do all the work on it?
1097 So you basically made over a hundred dollars an hour? That's—I mean, that's more than lawyers make sometimes, y'know? [Laugh] Should I be calling you CEO now or—
1098 No no no, don't do that thing where you like, minimize your success. This is huge! Are you gonna—I mean, are you thinking about doing more? Making it a real business?
1099 Because like, you clearly have the eye for it, right? And the skills—I couldn't even sew a button if my life depended on it, honestly.
1100 Okay but that's—that's exactly my point! [Chuckle] To you it's nothing, but you've got this whole talent that people will literally pay twelve hundred dollars for.
1101 Um, excuse me? You didn't just sell old clothes—you made art, basically. That person saw the value in what you created, y'know? They wanted it that badly.
1102 Wait WHAT? They want—okay buried the lead much? That's incredible! You're gonna do it, right? Please tell me you're gonna at least consider it because this could be like, your actual thing.
1103 Wait wait wait—WHAT? You passed the—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like, you're actually gonna be a lawyer? This is—this is huge!
1104 And you're just—you're just sitting there like it's nothing? [Laugh] I mean, holy shit, do you know how many people fail that thing? Like, the first time especially?
1105 Okay but still—still! You're in that sixty percent! We should be, I dunno, popping champagne or something. How do you feel? Like, honestly?
1106 Yeah no, I bet you're—god, you've been studying for like, what, three months straight? Every single day. Your brain must be completely fried right now.
1107 Have you told your parents yet? Because your mom is gonna—[Gasp] oh she's gonna absolutely lose it. In like, the best way possible, y'know?
1108 I'm the—wait, really? You told me first? That's... okay that's actually really sweet. But also like, you gotta call them! They've been so worried about you.
1109 Are you—okay, can I ask something? You seem kinda... I dunno, not as excited as I thought you'd be? Which is totally fine, I'm just—
1110 Oh totally, totally. That makes sense. It's probably like—what's that thing called? Post-exam weird empty feeling? When you've been working toward something for so long and then suddenly it's just... done?
1111 Well I'm—I'm proud of you. Like, genuinely so proud. You worked your ass off for this and you did it. [Softer] You actually did it.
1112 So um, when do you get to like—when's the swearing in ceremony thing? Because I'm definitely coming to that, just so you know. Non-negotiable.
1113 Wait wait wait—are you serious? That's like, that's huge! Oh my god, I mean, do you even realize how competitive that is? They only pick like what, thirty artists?
1114 Twenty—okay that's even more insane! How are you so calm right now? I'd be literally bouncing off the walls. When did you find out?
1115 Of course you are, I mean—this is kinda life-changing stuff, y'know? Like, galleries scout at Riverside. Real ones. [Laugh] God, I'm getting nervous for you and it's not even my thing.
1116 Okay no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. Your work is incredible and you know it. Actually, you probably don't know it because you're like, chronically modest, but trust me on this one.
1117 Well yeah, obviously it's—I mean, it's gonna feel different because it IS different. But isn't that kinda... good? Like you're finally getting the space you deserve?
1118 Oh. Oh shit, I didn't even—[Sigh] okay yeah, the business side is rough. But like, can't you get sponsors or something? My cousin did that crowdfunding thing for her gallery show.
1119 It's not weird, it's literally how artists survive! Everyone does it. Actually wait—doesn't your job have that arts grant program? The one where they—you know what I'm talking about?
1120 Of course they did, because why would they actually support—ugh, sorry. I'm just frustrated for you. This should be pure celebration and instead you're stressed about logistics.
1121 You will, you totally will, but like—let people help? Please? I know you hate that but honestly, we all wanna see you succeed. This is such a big deal.
1122 Yeah, no, totally get that. Just—promise me you won't talk yourself out of it? Because this is your thing, this is what you've been working toward for like, years now. [Softer] You deserve this.
1123 Oh. Um, okay—look, I was gonna tell you, I swear, I just... I wasn't ready to tell anyone yet, y'know? It literally just happened like two weeks ago and I'm still processing it myself.
1124 Yeah, I know how that sounds, but—[sigh] honestly, I haven't told anyone. Derek only knows 'cause he works in HR and saw the paperwork. That's not me choosing to tell him over you.
1125 How? How was I supposed to—"Hey, I have big news but I can't tell you"? Come on, that's not... that's not how conversations work. You would've just pushed until I told you anyway.
1126 I didn't—okay okay, fine, I didn't bring it up. But it's my news, right? Like, I get to decide when I'm ready to share it. [frustrated laugh] I'm not obligated to immediately broadcast every single thing that happens in my life.
1127 Because I wasn't ready! I just—I dunno, I needed time to figure out what this means for me, for my life, before everyone starts having opinions about it. Is that really so terrible?
1128 No, you're not, but you're also—look look, you know how you get. You would've immediately started planning my whole future, telling me what apartment to get, how to negotiate, and I just... I needed to sit with it first.
1129 That's not—[groan] that's not what I'm saying and you know it. You care, I get it, but sometimes caring means giving people space to process their own stuff, y'know? Not everything has to be a joint decision.
1130 Would you though? Really? 'Cause last time I tried to keep something to myself—remember my dad's surgery?—you literally got mad that I was being "distant" and "shutting you out."
1131 How? How was it different? I needed time then, I needed time now. But apparently I'm just—I'm the bad friend either way, right? I either share too much or not enough. There's literally no winning with you sometimes.
1132 Okay, you know what? Fine fine, I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the promotion the second it happened. But I'm not gonna apologize for needing time to process my own life. [scoff] That's not lying, that's just... being human.
1133 SCENARIO: discovering the thing they bought went on sale the next day
1134 [breathless] Marcus, look at those towers! [louder] They're completely intact after all these centuries. [Gasping] The golden inscriptions are still glowing somehow—this changes everything we thought we knew about the Aztari civilization and their technology.
1135 [urgently] We need to document everything before the sun sets! [excited squeal] Oh my God, that's a perfectly preserved astronomical calendar! [faster pace] Quick, hand me the camera—no archaeologist has ever seen craftsmanship this intricate before in pre-Columbian ruins!
1136 [dismissively] Don't be superstitious now! [enthusiastic shout] This is the discovery of the millennium! [Chuckle] Though I admit, those statues do seem to follow you with their eyes—probably just clever architectural angles designed to intimidate visitors.
1137 [determined] Then let's go investigate the inner chambers. [wavering slightly] Although... why are there no signs of decay anywhere? [thoughtfully] Even the fabric banners are pristine, as if someone's been maintaining this place all along.
1138 [mockingly] And risk someone else claiming our discovery? [firm tone] Absolutely not happening! [Excited yelp] Besides, look at that jade altar—it's covered in hieroglyphs we've never seen before! This could rewrite history books completely!
1139 [contemplative] What if they had help we don't understand? [more excitedly] The legends always spoke of sky visitors! [Heavy breathing] That doorway ahead is opening on its own—the mechanisms still work after all this time somehow!
1140 [triumphantly] Then what are we waiting for? [softer] History is calling our names! [Delighted squeak] Can you imagine the academic papers, the lectures, the complete revolution in archaeological understanding this will bring to our field?
1141 [sarcastically] Famous last words, my friend! [playful tone] But you're probably right about the traps. [Gasps loudly] Oh wow, the walls in here are covered in pure gold leaf—this wealth is absolutely staggering to behold!
1142 [mysteriously] Unless they had telescopes we haven't found yet. [more intensely] Or something even better. [Nervous laughter] That pedestal in the center is holding something—it's glowing with its own light source, pulsing like it's alive!
1143 [resolutely] We came here to make history! [gentler] Whatever happens, we do this together. [Deep breath] On three, we both reach for it—one, two—wait, do you hear those footsteps echoing behind us now?
1144 [confused] Excuse me, um, I'm trying to use this AR thing on my phone but—[frustrated sigh]—nothing's happening when I point it at product SKU-4478B. [hesitantly] Is there like a specific angle I need or something?
1145 [relieved] Oh wait, yeah, there's a frame now! [excitedly] But it keeps saying "calibration needed" and—[groans]—the percentage just stuck at 47%. Should I try moving to aisle 12-B instead where the lighting's better?
1146 [amazed] Whoa, it just—it worked! [laughs nervously] I can see the sofa in my living room now, but um, the color looks weird? [puzzled tone] Like it's showing beige but the tag says item color BLU-445?
1147 [frustrated groan] Now the whole thing crashed and there's an error—[reading slowly] "Exception at memory address 0x7B4A." [sarcastically] Super helpful, right? My session ID was, uh, let me check... AS-99412-K if that matters?
1148 [skeptically] Okay, it's back up but—[surprised gasp]—wow, there's like twenty different furniture pieces floating everywhere! [bewildered] Is this supposed to happen with multi-scan batch MRX-200, or did I break something at coordinates 41.2, -73.8?
1149 [cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling TechNet Support, my name is Sarah. [quickly] How can I assist you today with your internet service?
1150 [apologetically] Oh, I completely understand your frustration, sir. [more quickly] Let me pull up your account right away—can I get your account number or the phone number associated with your service?
1151 [briskly] Perfect, I see your account here, Mr. Davidson. [concerned] You're right, I'm seeing multiple outage reports and... wow, five incidents is definitely not acceptable. [more firmly] Let me check what's happening in your area.
1152 [reassuringly] I absolutely see all your previous calls documented here, Mr. Davidson. [quickly] It looks like there's been ongoing maintenance in your area that's been... well, poorly coordinated. [more apologetically] This shouldn't have affected you this many times.
1153 [urgently] That's completely unacceptable, and I want to escalate this immediately. [more briskly] I'm going to transfer you to our technical escalation team, but first—[emphatically] I'm applying a credit for this entire month's service to your account.
1154 [quickly] Yes, absolutely, I'm scheduling priority dispatch right now. [confidently] We'll have our senior technician there between 2 and 4 PM today—not tomorrow, today. [more firmly] They'll check your line from the pole to your modem.
1155 [determinedly] This technician will do a complete diagnostic, I promise you that. [rapidly] They'll test signal strength, check for interference, inspect all connections, and replace any questionable equipment. [more reassuringly] We're treating this as a critical issue.
1156 [briskly] Someone should be home—they'll need to test your internal connections too. [helpfully] The technician will call you thirty minutes before arrival, and I'm also... [enthusiastically] I'm waiving any service fees for this visit.
1157 [earnestly] It absolutely does mean something, Mr. Davidson. [quickly] I'm personally flagging your account for our regional manager's review, and—[more intently] I'm giving you my direct extension for any future issues.
1158 [confidently] We are, one hundred percent. [rapidly] Extension 4782, ask for Sarah, I'm here Monday through Friday. [warmly] I'll also call you tomorrow to confirm everything was resolved properly.
1159 [Angry] This is—oh come ON, not now, not TODAY of all days! [Groan] They're gonna be here in, what, twenty minutes?
1160 [Fast] Okay okay okay, where's the plunger, where did I—it's gotta be around here somewhere, right? [Tsk]
1161 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, yeah, this is exactly how I wanted to spend my afternoon. [Sigh] Just me and the toilet having a moment.
1162 [Whisper] Please, please just go down, I'm literally begging you right now.
1163 [Happy] Wait, I think it's actually—yes! [Laugh] Oh thank god, it's finally working!
1164 [Disappointed] I, um, I really thought that would fix it, but it's still just... sitting there. [Sigh]
1165 [Shout] Can someone grab me the—actually, never mind, I'll get it myself!
1166 [Slow] You know what, maybe if I just, like, wait a few minutes it'll kinda resolve itself?
1167 [Sad] This is so embarrassing, I mean, what am I gonna tell them when they need to use the bathroom? [Groan]
1168 [Fast] [Angry] I don't have time for this, I really don't have—ugh, why is nothing working?!
1169 [Chuckle] Honestly, this would be funny if it wasn't, you know, literally about to ruin my entire party.
1170 [Whisper] [Slow] Just gonna try one more time, nice and easy, no sudden movements.
1171 [Disappointed] The plumber said he can't get here until tomorrow, so that's, uh, that's not gonna help. [Tsk]
1172 [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Great, now there's water on the floor too—this just keeps getting better!
1173 [Happy] [Fast] My neighbor has a snake thingy, she said I can borrow it right now!
1174 [Angry] [Shout] Who puts an entire roll of paper towels in here?! WHO DOES THAT?!
1175 [Slow] [Sad] I guess we could just, um, put an out of order sign on it?
1176 [Fast] Google says baking soda and vinegar, but like, do I even have time to—okay, worth a shot.
1177 [Disappointed] [Sigh] Seven people coming over and one working bathroom—this is gonna be a disaster, isn't it?
1178 [Happy] [Chuckle] You know what, forget it, we're just gonna laugh about this later, right?
1179 SCENARIO: Calmly describing a social media comment they left, then checking the thread, then seeing they completely misread the situation and look like an idiot, spiraling into public comment shame
1180 I know, I know, okay? But it's not like I was ignoring you on purpose. I literally just—things got crazy and I meant to respond but then I completely forgot. It happens.
1181 Don't do that. Don't just repeat what I say like—[sigh] look, I get that you're mad, but I've been dealing with a lot. My brain's been everywhere and honestly, I can barely keep track of anything right now.
1182 And I'm sorry about that, I am, but like—you can't expect me to be available 24/7. Sometimes I just... I dunno, I get overwhelmed and I shut down. That's not about you.
1183 That's not—okay, that's not fair. You're acting like I deliberately chose to hurt you when really I just... I saw your message, thought I'd respond later when I had more energy, and then completely spaced. [frustrated laugh] It literally had nothing to do with you.
1184 Oh come on, seriously? Posting a stupid meme takes two seconds. Responding to actual conversations when you're already drowning in—that's different and you know it. You're being kinda unfair here.
1185 Yeah, actually, you are. Like, I'm trying to explain what happened but you're just—you're not even listening. You've already decided I'm the bad guy here, haven't you?
1186 I'm saying it now! And honestly, sometimes I don't even realize how bad it is until like, days later when I'm coming up for air and—shit, I forgot to text back like five people, not just you.
1187 That's not what I—[groan] you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I messed up, okay? I should've responded. But you're acting like this is some huge betrayal when it's just... I'm human, I forget things when I'm stressed.
1188 No, not whatever. Don't do that. I'm trying here, but you gotta meet me halfway. Like, have I ever intentionally blown you off before? Have I ever not been there when you really really needed me?
1189 And I'm sorry about that, okay? I am. But I'm also not gonna stand here and let you make me feel like garbage for being overwhelmed and making a mistake. That's—I dunno, that's not what friends do either.
1190 Wait, what? I—okay, hold on, I thought you were being sarcastic! You had that tone, y'know? The one you always use when you're messing around.
1191 Oh god—I didn't—look, you literally just said "guess who's joining the chemo club" and did that weird [nervous laugh] half-smile thing. How was I supposed to know you were being serious?
1192 That's not—come on, that's not fair. You joke about dark stuff all the time! Remember last week when you said your car died and I was all sympathetic and you were like "gotcha, it just needs gas"?
1193 No, I know, but I'm saying—I mean, you gotta understand why I thought... Look, I'm sorry I laughed, okay? But you're acting like I'm some kind of monster when honestly, you weren't exactly clear.
1194 You said "chemo club!" That sounds like—I dunno, that sounds like something you'd say as a joke! And you were smiling, kinda, so I just... [sigh] I reacted wrong, fine.
1195 What do you want me to say? I can't un-laugh. I feel terrible about it, obviously, but I also think you're being kinda unfair here. You deliver serious news like it's a punchline and then get mad when I—when I misread it.
1196 Well I didn't—how was I supposed to know that? I'm not psychic. You were doing your deflecting thing, the same voice you use when you're like, avoiding feelings or whatever.
1197 No! No no no, I'm not blaming—ugh, see this is what you do. You twist everything. I'm trying to explain that it was a misunderstanding, not that it's your fault.
1198 It's—yeah, okay, it's partially mine. Happy? But honestly, if you'd just said "my dad has cancer" straight up, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. [frustrated exhale] Instead you made it sound like a bit.
1199 Don't—don't do that. The passive aggressive thing. Look, I'm sorry about your dad, I really am. And I'm sorry I laughed. But I'm not gonna pretend like I'm a hundred percent the bad guy here when you basically set me up to fail.
1200 I—what? How was I supposed to warn you about something I didn't even know was gonna happen? Like, I'm not psychic.
1201 Okay okay, yeah, I knew he could be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I didn't think he'd—look, everyone knew that about him. You knew that about him too.
1202 That's not—[scoff] seriously? You're gonna put this on me because I what, dated his roommate for like three months? That doesn't mean I had some insider knowledge about him screwing you over.
1203 What signs? No, honestly, what signs? Because I'm kinda getting tired of you acting like I had this—this crystal ball or something. I didn't see anything you couldn't have seen yourself.
1204 Don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down on me. I mean, I get you're hurt, I really do, but you can't just [frustrated laugh] decide I'm the bad guy here because things went south.
1205 I did have your back! I always have your back, but I can't—I can't protect you from stuff I don't know is coming. That's not fair to ask.
1206 Maybe I had a—a weird vibe or whatever, but that's not the same as knowing. You get weird vibes about people all the time and don't say anything. Remember Tyler? Remember how that turned out?
1207 How? How was it different? Because from where I'm sitting, it's exactly the same except I'm not—[sigh] I'm not throwing it in your face like you're doing to me right now.
1208 No no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You don't get to just drop this bomb on me and walk away. I'm sorry you got hurt, okay? I really am. But I'm not gonna apologize for not being omniscient.
1209 And maybe I should've, I dunno. But you gotta understand—I didn't know know. I just had this gut feeling, and honestly? You wouldn't have listened anyway. We both know you wouldn't have listened.
1210 Oh god, okay—I know how this looks, but it's not—I mean, it is what it looks like but there's more to it, y'know? Marcus was in real trouble and I just—I couldn't let him—
1211 No no no, please, just let me explain! He was gonna lose his job if anyone found out, and his kid—he's got a kid now, did you know that? And I thought, like, what's one little lie, right? [nervous laugh] Except it wasn't little to you, was it?
1212 That's not—that's not what I was doing! I swear to god, I wasn't choosing anyone, I was just trying to help and I—I messed up. I really, really messed up.
1213 I know. And honestly? I've been feeling sick about it since it happened. Like, literally sick. Because you trusted me and I—[groan]—I completely betrayed that trust, didn't I? I'm such an idiot.
1214 I wasn't planning—okay, that's a lie too. God, I can't even—I'm doing it again. I was gonna tell you, I swear I was, but then days kept passing and it got harder and harder to bring up, y'know?
1215 I know it was stupid! I know, okay? I just—I panicked and then I kept panicking and before I knew it I was in too deep and I didn't know how to fix it without making everything worse.
1216 Yeah. Yeah, I did. [sigh] Look, I don't—I don't expect you to forgive me right away or anything. But you gotta know that our friendship means everything to me. Like, genuinely everything.
1217 I deserve that. I do. But I'm gonna—I wanna make this right, somehow. Whatever it takes. Even if you hate me right now, which, like, totally understandable if you do.
1218 That's—that's actually worse. Oh god, that's so much worse. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna fix this, I promise. I'll tell Marcus I can't cover for him anymore, I'll—I'll do whatever you need me to do.
1219 Yes. Yes, absolutely. I promise—and I know my promises probably don't mean much right now but—I promise. No more lies. Ever. [quieter] Thank you for even listening to me. I know I didn't deserve it.
1220 SCENARIO: deciding what to make for dinner with limited ingredients
1221 [whispered awe] I can't believe we actually found it. [trembling] Twenty years of searching, and here it stands. [Sharp intake] Wait—do you see those symbols moving on the walls? They're shifting like they're alive or something.
1222 [nervous laugh] Should we really be touching anything? [quieter] This place feels... sacred, almost watchful. [Long exhale] The air tastes different here, metallic and ancient, like breathing in centuries of untold secrets waiting to be discovered.
1223 [hushed reverence] Listen to that humming sound coming from the temple. [more slowly] It's almost like a heartbeat, rhythmic and deep. [Soft gasp] The entire structure must be hollow inside—imagine what treasures could be waiting in there!
1224 [fearful whisper] Marcus, there are fresh footprints in the dust over there. [voice rising] Someone's been here recently—very recently. [Nervous giggle] Maybe we should radio base camp first, let them know what we've found before proceeding any further.
1225 [amazed] You're right, these symbols predate anything in our databases. [getting quieter] They almost look alien in origin. [Whistles softly] The precision of these carvings would be impossible even with modern tools—how did they achieve this?
1226 [panicked] That's impossible! Stone doesn't move by itself! [calmer] Unless there's some kind of counterweight system we triggered. [Shaky exhale] Either way, that chamber beyond looks untouched—we could be the first humans inside for millennia.
1227 [reluctantly] Fine, but we stick together no matter what. [steadier voice] And if anything seems dangerous, we leave immediately. [Sharp laugh] Though I doubt ancient booby traps are still functional after all this time has passed.
1228 [stunned silence] That's not just gold—those are star maps! [increasingly excited] Incredibly detailed astronomical charts! [Choking up] They knew about star systems we only discovered with telescopes—this knowledge shouldn't have been possible back then!
1229 [barely audible] Should we touch it? [stronger] Every instinct says no, but scientifically... [Trail off] The energy readings on my equipment are going absolutely crazy—whatever that thing is, it's still active and generating power somehow.
1230 [terrified whisper] Those aren't our footsteps, Marcus. [voice cracking] Someone's coming up the passage behind us. [Panicked gasp] The door we came through—it's sealing itself! We're trapped in here with whatever's approaching us right now!
1231 [defensive] Ma'am, according to our records under ticket number J-7742-X, [more firmly] you signed the waiver acknowledging the dress had pre-existing wine stains. [sighs] We did our best with the delicate lace, but some damage was already permanent.
1232 [in a measured tone] I understand you're upset, but our cleaning log from Tuesday, October 3rd shows [more defensively] we documented every issue before processing. [clears throat] Your receipt copy should have the same information—customer ID 45821-B.
1233 [irritated] Look, I've been doing this for fifteen years, okay? [more sternly] That dress had oxidized stains, probably from improper storage at temperature above 72 degrees. [defensively] We can't perform magic on neglected fabrics.
1234 [sarcastically] Oh, please do call your lawyer. [more confidently] Our liability coverage under policy TX-9908-ML only covers up to $250 for specialty items unless you purchased additional insurance, [smugly] which, according to my screen here, you declined.
1235 [slightly softer] I... I get that this is stressful. [sighs] Look, I can offer you a credit of $189.50 for the service, [reluctantly] and maybe our seamstress could attempt repairs tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, no guarantees though.
1236 [firmly] That's not going to happen, ma'am. [more matter-of-factly] Our maximum payout, even with manager approval from Mr. Henderson, is $500. [tiredly] I can process that check today if you sign the settlement form W-122.
1237 [defensively] It's 3847, and go ahead! [more defiantly] We have security footage from camera C-4 showing the dress condition at drop-off. [confidently] Our corporate office at 200 Industrial Parkway will back us up completely on this.
1238 [exhaustedly] Ma'am, I'm trying to help here, okay? [more gently] What if we expedite ship it to our specialist in Dallas—facility code DTX-44? [hopefully] They might salvage it by Friday afternoon, but it'll cost an extra $275.
1239 [cautiously] If we overnight it using tracking number beginning with EX7, it should arrive by 4:30 PM Friday. [more seriously] I'll personally call their manager, Mrs. Chen at extension 5502, but [sighs] you'll need to sign liability waiver L-888 right now.
1240 [professionally] Thank you for calling MediCare Plus, my name is Sandra. [quickly] I see you're calling about a formulary issue—how can I help you today?
1241 [sympathetically] I understand your frustration, sir. [more briskly] Let me pull up your account and check the formulary changes for 2024. [typing pace] Can you verify your member ID, please?
1242 [reassuringly] I see your account now, Mr. Peterson. [quickly] You're right, Lipitor moved to tier four, but [optimistically] we have atorvastatin on tier one—it's the same active ingredient.
1243 [apologetically] I'm sorry you experienced that. [speaking faster] Have you considered filing an exception request? [helpfully] Your doctor can submit documentation about why you need the brand name specifically.
1244 [briskly] Standard review takes seventy-two hours, but [more enthusiastically] we can expedite it to twenty-four hours if your doctor marks it urgent. [efficiently] I can start the process now if you'd like.
1245 [calmly] If the first exception is denied, you have appeal rights. [speaking quickly] Level one, level two, then external review—but [more gently] honestly, with documented side effects, approval chances are good.
1246 [quickly] Your doctor can provide samples, or [more carefully] we have a temporary override I can apply—gives you a one-time fill at tier two pricing while pending review.
1247 [sympathetically] I know it's not ideal. [more briskly] The override goes through immediately, so you can fill today. [efficiently] Should I activate that for you now, Mr. Peterson?
1248 [reassuringly] We'll send a letter within twenty-four hours of decision. [speaking faster] But here's a reference number—X-J-9-0-3-4—you can check status anytime online or call back with that.
1249 [apologetically] I understand your frustration completely. [more firmly] I've noted everything in your file, and [quickly] I'm flagging this for supervisor review too—sometimes that helps with exceptions.
1250 [Fast] Okay so, I walk in there, right, and everyone just stops talking—like, dead silence. [Tsk] It was so obvious they'd been talking about me.
1251 [Slow] You gotta understand something here... I've never, um, I've never done anything like that before in my entire life. [Sigh]
1252 [Angry] She literally said—and I'm quoting here—that I was being "dramatic"! [Shout] Me! Can you believe that?
1253 [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda knew something was off when he wouldn't look me in the eye. [Chuckle] Should've trusted my gut.
1254 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, apparently I'm the bad guy for, uh, for actually showing up on time. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Makes total sense.
1255 [Happy] And then—wait, this is the best part—he actually apologized! [Laugh] Like, genuinely said he was wrong!
1256 [Sad] I dunno, maybe I should've just... kept my mouth shut, y'know? [Slow] Maybe none of this would've happened.
1257 Was I supposed to just stand there and—actually, you know what? [Fast] [Angry] Yes, I said what I said and I meant every word.
1258 [Disappointed] The whole thing was basically a misunderstanding, but, um, nobody wanted to hear my side. [Sigh] Still don't, apparently.
1259 [Whisper] [Fast] I'm gonna tell you something but you can't—you absolutely cannot tell anyone else, okay?
1260 [Chuckle] Honestly? Looking back, it's kinda funny how worked up everyone got over, like, literally nothing. [Happy]
1261 [Slow] Three times. [Angry] I asked him three times to just... to just listen for one second. [Groan]
1262 [Sarcastic] Right, because I definitely woke up that morning thinking "hey, let's ruin everyone's day!" [Tsk] [Disappointed] That's exactly what I wanted.
1263 [Fast] [Happy] No no no, wait—I forgot the part where she tried to blame it on the dog! The dog!
1264 [Sad] [Whisper] I mean, if I could go back and—I dunno, maybe I wouldn't change anything actually.
1265 [Shout] Twenty dollars! [Angry] We're having this whole argument over twenty stupid dollars! It's insane!
1266 [Slow] You ever have one of those moments where you're like... this isn't actually happening to me right now? [Sigh] [Disappointed] Yeah.
1267 [Happy] [Fast] So I just started laughing—couldn't help it—and that's when everyone realized how ridiculous we were being!
1268 [Sarcastic] I'm sure my opinion doesn't matter, but, uh, since you asked so nicely... [Chuckle] Here's what really went down.
1269 [Disappointed] Look, I tried to—actually, forget it. [Sad] [Sigh] You've already made up your mind about what happened anyway.
1270 SCENARIO: Complaining about a full inbox, then most being spam they can mass delete
1271 I didn't—that's not what happened. I didn't take anyone's side, I just said I could see where they were coming from, which—honestly, is that really such a crime?
1272 And I get that, I do, but you're asking me to like, blindly agree with you even when—look, you know I care about you, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna pretend you were totally right when you weren't.
1273 That's not—[frustrated laugh] see, this is what you do. You twist everything. I'm saying there were valid points on both sides, which is literally just being objective.
1274 Yeah, objective. I mean—what, you wanted me to just jump in and be like "yeah, they're totally wrong, you're totally right" when that wasn't even true? That's not who I am and you know it.
1275 I do have your back! But having your back doesn't mean—okay okay, it doesn't mean I have to agree with every single thing you say or do. [Sigh] That's not friendship, that's just... I dunno, enabling or whatever.
1276 How? By saying "I can see both perspectives"? Come on, that's barely—that's nothing. You're acting like I threw you under the bus when all I did was try to be fair.
1277 That's—god, that's so unfair. You know what? I'm kinda getting frustrated here because you're making me out to be this terrible friend when I've literally been there for you through everything else.
1278 Doesn't matter? Are you—[scoff] wow. Okay. So all those times I did support you, even when you were dead wrong, just... poof, gone?
1279 And I'm sorry it felt like I let you down, I am, but—look look, you gotta understand, I can't just turn off my brain and pretend I don't see both sides of something. That's not fair to ask of me.
1280 No, but you're asking me to pick sides when it's not even—when there shouldn't have to be sides between friends. I mean, can't I just... exist in the middle sometimes without it being this huge betrayal?
1281 Wait wait wait—THE design blog? The one you're like, obsessed with? Oh my god, are you—are you serious right now?
1282 I'm literally—okay I need to see this immediately. Like right now. Is it—wait, did they say nice things? They better have said nice things because honestly that kitchen is [Gasp] gorgeous.
1283 Unpre—okay that's actually kinda perfect for you though, right? I mean, you hate all that like, showy stuff. Remember when we went to that open house and you were basically horrified by the gold fixtures?
1284 But seriously though, this is—this is huge! Like, people are gonna be pinning your kitchen all over Pinterest now. You're basically famous. How do you even feel about that?
1285 Your sink is— [Laugh] okay only you would focus on that part. But like, aren't you even a little bit excited? You worked so hard on that whole renovation.
1286 No no no, stop being all—you know what you're doing. You're deflecting. This is amazing and you know it's amazing and I'm not gonna let you downplay this.
1287 Oh god, what did he—wait, let me guess. Something about how he knew it was special all along? Those guys always do that after the fact, like they weren't the ones suggesting beige everything.
1288 Of course he does! [Groan] That's so—ugh, typical. But whatever, you know? Let him. You're the one with the vision. Did they mention the backsplash? Because that backsplash is honestly art.
1289 Unexpected! See? That's—that's what I've been saying! You have like, this whole aesthetic that's just... you. I mean, I could never pull that off but on you it's perfect, y'know?
1290 Oh my god your mom—wait, she must be like, losing her mind right now. This is the best thing that's happened to her since you graduated. She's gonna print it out, isn't she? Frame it probably.
1291 That's not—I never said those exact words. I just said maybe you should, y'know, think about whether he's really gonna be there for you long-term. That's all.
1292 Yeah, actually, I am. Because last time you dated someone who was "figuring things out" you got hurt, remember? And I'm the one who had to—[sigh]—whatever, forget it.
1293 Okay okay, but come on, he literally just quit his third job this year. I'm not being judgmental, I'm being realistic. There's a difference.
1294 Um, yeah? Look, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I'm some kind of—like I'm attacking him personally. I don't even know the guy that well. I'm just worried about you.
1295 I said he seemed like he was—okay fine, that was harsh. [frustrated laugh] But honestly? Someone who lives with their parents at thirty and has no plan isn't exactly—I mean, I'm allowed to have an opinion.
1296 So what, I'm supposed to just watch you make the same mistakes and say nothing? That's what friends do now? Just nod and smile while you—while you settle for less than you deserve?
1297 I know that. I do. But I've been your friend for eight years and I—look look, I'm not trying to run your life here. I just thought maybe you'd wanna hear the truth from someone who cares about you.
1298 Okay, that's—[scoff] that's real profound. But y'know what? When this goes south, and you need someone to talk to at 2 AM, you're gonna call me. Like you always do.
1299 Seriously? You're gonna—that's where we're at now? Because I said what literally everyone else is thinking but won't say? I mean, even your sister thinks—
1300 Fine. Fine fine. I'm sorry I'm not being supportive enough or whatever. But I'm not gonna pretend I think this is a good idea just to make you feel better. That's not—I dunno, that's not who we are.
1301 Oh god, I—okay, I know how it looks but I didn't mean to take sides! They just told me what happened and I—I guess I just assumed... which was wrong, totally wrong.
1302 No no no, that came out wrong. I mean, I definitely—I should've talked to you first. Obviously. I just, they seemed so upset and I got caught up in the moment, y'know? But that's not—[groan] that's not an excuse.
1303 I know, I know. God, when you put it like that... I really messed up, didn't I? Like, majorly. I wasn't thinking about—I wasn't thinking at all, honestly. I just reacted.
1304 Can I just—can I explain? Not to make excuses but just... they called me crying and I'd never seen them like that before and I kinda panicked? And then before I knew it I was—I was comforting them and agreeing with them and [nervous laugh] I didn't even stop to think wait, what's the other side of this story?
1305 No! Well—okay, maybe for like a second but that's because I didn't have context! If I'd known your side, if I'd just called you first like I should've... ugh, I'm literally the worst friend ever.
1306 I deserve that. I do. But please, just—let me fix this? I wanna hear your version now. The real version. I promise I'll actually listen this time instead of just... jumping to conclusions like an idiot.
1307 That's not—I haven't though! I really haven't. After I had time to think about it, I realized how out of character it would be for you to do what they said you did. And then I felt like such garbage because [sigh] I shoulda known that right away, y'know?
1308 No. I didn't. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna regret that for a really long time. But I'm here now, right? Trying to make it right? That's gotta count for something... doesn't it?
1309 Look, I—I get it if you need time. Or if you can't trust me the same way anymore. I just... I miss my best friend and I hate that I hurt you. I hate it so much.
1310 I know. And I failed you. Completely. But if you give me another chance—and I totally understand if you won't—but if you do, I swear I will never, ever make that mistake again. Your back, always. No matter what.
1311 SCENARIO: debating whether to try a new route or stick to the usual
1312 [choking back tears] She saved us all, Maya. [Shaky breath] Every single one of us owes our freedom to her sacrifice. [whispering] I can still hear her voice telling us to run while she held them off.
1313 [defensively] You think I don't know that? [Sob] You think I don't replay it every night? [quieter] But she gave the order. Following her command was the last way we could honor her wishes.
1314 [fierce whisper] Don't you dare dishonor her memory with that talk. [steadier] She believed in this cause more than anything. [voice breaking] The resistance lives because she died—that was always her plan, even if we couldn't see it.
1315 [nostalgic tone] Remember how she'd make us laugh before raids? [Chuckle] That terrible impression of the general she'd do. [more serious] God, I'd give anything to hear that stupid voice one more time.
1316 [urgently] She'd haunt you forever if you threw your life away like that. [gentler] We finish this together, the way she taught us. [firmly] United we stand—that was her first lesson, remember?
1317 [determined] Then we make them remember her name. [rising volume] Elena Rodriguez wasn't just a martyr—she was a fighter, a friend, a sister. [passionate whisper] Every victory we win, we scream her name.
1318 [trembling whisper] I brought her favorite chocolate. [nervous laugh] Stupid, right? [voice cracking] But I thought maybe... maybe wherever she is, she'd know we remembered the little things too, not just the heroic stuff.
1319 [broken] Why did it have to be her? [more desperately] There were twenty of us that day. [Gasping breath] Twenty chances for someone else to be the hero. But no, Elena always had to be first.
1320 [angrily] Armor with too many holes in it, apparently. [Grunt] The medics said she took seventeen bullets. [horrified whisper] Seventeen. How does someone even stay standing that long?
1321 [resigned] The sunrise looks different without her. [Sigh] Colors seem muted, like the world knows it lost something irreplaceable. [softly] But we keep watching them, because she can't anymore.
1322 [flatly] Hi, I'm calling about my MindfulMe app, account ID MM-7842-X9. [sighs heavily] I just... I noticed you updated your privacy policy again, and [trailing off] I don't know if I even care anymore, but what changed?
1323 [monotone] Sure, whatever. [long exhale] I've been using this app for like, what, three months? [more quietly] Nothing's really helping anyway, so maybe my data doesn't even matter.
1324 [dismissively] Crisis support, meditation tracks, mood journals... [groans] I've tried them all since October 23rd. [flatly] So you're selling my sad little check-ins to researchers now, is that it?
1325 [sarcastically] Oh good, my 3 AM anxiety spirals are safe behind some... some fancy numbers. [sighs] Look, can I just—can I opt out of everything? [defeated] Delete account number MM-7842-X9 entirely?
1326 [bitterly] Forty-seven days of what exactly? [quieter] Pressing buttons, rating my mood from one to ten every morning at 7:15? [sighs deeply] Fine, how do I pause this sharing thing without losing everything?
1327 [briskly] Good afternoon, Valley Medical Labs, this is Sarah speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today—do you have a patient ID number ready?
1328 [apologetically] Let me just... pull that up for you right away. [pause] [more concerned] Oh, I see there's been a delay with your lipid panel—looks like the sample needed to be re-run.
1329 [quickly] I completely understand your frustration, and you're absolutely right—someone should have contacted you. [more firmly] The system shows a notification was sent, but, um, sometimes those get caught in spam filters.
1330 [reassuring] The good news is the re-test was completed yesterday morning. [speaking faster] Your results should be uploaded within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, definitely by Thursday at the latest.
1331 [more confidently] I'm putting a priority flag on your file right now—actually, let me... [briskly] I'm sending a direct message to the lab supervisor to expedite this for your Friday appointment.
1332 [carefully] While I can't make absolute promises, the priority flag means your results jump to the front of the queue. [more enthusiastically] In my experience, these usually process within twelve hours once flagged.
1333 [warmly] Please do ask for me—I'll be here nine to five. [quickly] I'm also adding my direct extension to your file notes, it's 2-2-4.
1334 [understanding] No apologies needed—waiting for health results is incredibly stressful. [more gently] We see it every day, and honestly, two weeks is unacceptable for a standard panel.
1335 [reassuringly] It's actually quite rare, maybe one in two hundred samples. [speaking faster] Usually it's due to temperature issues during transport or, occasionally, insufficient sample volume—but the re-test results are completely reliable.
1336 [laughing gently] I promise we're much more organized than that! [briskly] Is there anything else I can help with while I have your file open—update contact information, anything like that?
1337 [Nervous] I know everyone thinks it's ridiculous, but like, elevators are basically death traps waiting to—to just drop, you know? [Fast] What if the cable snaps?
1338 [Whisper] Dogs can sense fear, right? [Tsk] So every time I see one, even a tiny one, I'm convinced it knows I'm terrified.
1339 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, flying is "statistically safe," but statistics don't help when you're thirty thousand feet up in a metal tube. [Groan]
1340 [Sad] My friends don't invite me to beach trips anymore because I just—I can't do the ocean thing. [Sigh] Too much water, too many unknowns underneath.
1341 [Angry] It's not funny, okay? [Shout] Balloons literally make me break out in a sweat—the popping, the static, everything about them!
1342 [Happy] You wanna know something hilarious? [Laugh] I'm a grown adult who still runs up the basement stairs because of the dark!
1343 [Slow] The thing about spiders is, um, they move in this really unpredictable way that just... [Whisper] I dunno, it makes my skin crawl.
1344 [Disappointed] I tried therapy for the needle thing, but honestly? [Tsk] Still can't even watch medical shows without covering my eyes.
1345 [Fast] Okay so basically my whole family thinks I'm being dramatic but thunder is LOUD and sudden and—and you never know when it's coming! [Groan]
1346 [Sarcastic] "Just face your fears," they said. [Chuckle] Yeah, let me just casually approach that clown at my nephew's birthday party—that'll go well.
1347 [Sad] I haven't been to the dentist in, uh, three years? [Slow] The drill sound alone makes me literally nauseous just thinking about it.
1348 [Angry] People act like I choose to be scared of heights—trust me, I'd love to enjoy rooftop bars like everyone else! [Sigh]
1349 [Whisper] Sometimes I'll be driving and imagine the bridge just, like, collapsing? [Fast] And then I grip the wheel so tight my knuckles go white.
1350 [Happy] My boyfriend bought me a bird—a BIRD—for my birthday without knowing about my whole wing-flapping phobia thing. [Laugh] [Sarcastic] That was a fun surprise.
1351 [Disappointed] I wanted to be a chef, y'know? [Tsk] But I can't even look at raw chicken without getting all panicky about germs and contamination.
1352 [Slow] Moths are just... they're so erratic and dusty and they always—always—fly straight at your face. [Shout] Why do they DO that?!
1353 [Fast] I mean, everyone gets a little nervous public speaking, right? [Nervous] But I literally threw up before my wedding toast—my own wedding!
1354 [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm totally fine with bees—if by "fine" you mean I once abandoned my car in a parking lot because one flew in. [Chuckle]
1355 [Sad] The worst part about being scared of crowds is that, um, you basically can't do anything fun anymore—no concerts, no festivals... [Sigh] Nothing.
1356 [Angry] My therapist keeps saying "mice are more afraid of you," but like—that doesn't help when one runs across my kitchen! [Fast] [Groan] I stood on a chair for an hour!
