1  I wasn't—okay, maybe I was a little short with them, but honestly? I'm just looking out for you. You've been together what, two months? And already they're trying to control who you hang out with?
2  Come on, seriously? They literally got upset because you wanted to have one night with your friends. That's—that's not normal, okay? And I'm supposed to just smile and pretend everything's fine?
3  Mean? I barely said like five words to them all night. [Scoff] Look, I'm sorry if I wasn't super friendly, but I'm not gonna fake being best friends with someone who I think is—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.
4  See, this is what I'm talking about! You used to actually listen when I had concerns about stuff. Now it's like—Alex says jump and you're already in the air. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, I'm worried about you.
5  Yeah, worried! Is that so hard to believe? We've been friends for how long? And suddenly I'm the bad guy because I don't immediately love your new partner who, by the way, has been kinda sketchy about their whole situation?
6  I mean—look look, their story keeps changing. First they were "between jobs," then they were freelancing, now they're starting a business? [Frustrated laugh] And you're paying for everything, which—fine, your money, but come on.
7  It is when you're borrowing money from me last week! I'm not—okay okay, I shouldn't have brought that up. But you gotta understand why I'm not exactly thrilled about this whole thing, right?
8  I wasn't passive-aggressive, I was just... distant. There's a difference. And honestly? I thought I was being pretty restrained considering I wanted to say something way more direct about the whole situation.
9  That's—[groan] you know what? Fine. I'm sorry I wasn't nicer to Alex. There. But I'm not sorry for being concerned, and I'm definitely not gonna pretend I like them when I don't. That's not who I am.
10  Are you—are you serious right now? You're gonna throw away our entire friendship over someone you barely know? Because I was a little cold at dinner? I mean, if that's what you want, fine fine, but that's on you, not me.
11  Comments? What—oh. Oh no. Is this about the thing I said at dinner? Because I was just joking around, you know? I didn't mean anything by it, honestly.
12  That's not—okay, maybe I've made a few jokes but like, I make jokes about everything, right? That's just how I am. I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. [nervous laugh] I mean, I should've noticed, shouldn't I?
13  Oh god, I did say that. I—wait wait wait, but I was being sarcastic! You know I don't actually think that. I was just—everyone makes those jokes about government jobs, I didn't think—
14  No no no, that's not what I meant. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I know those comments were stupid. Really stupid. I guess I was kinda... I dunno, maybe jealous? Of your benefits and stability and—that's not an excuse though.
15  Yeah, I mean—my job is such a mess right now and yours seems so... together? And instead of being happy for you I was being a jerk about it. Which is literally the worst way to handle it, I know.
16  You're right. You're completely right. I should've—god, I should've just been honest instead of making those dumb passive-aggressive comments. I think I was trying to make myself feel better but obviously that's [sigh] that's so messed up. I'm really, really sorry.
17  I know you did! That's what makes it worse—like, you studied for that exam for months, and you've been working your way up, and I just... minimized all of that. With stupid jokes that weren't even funny.
18  They were terrible. Honestly, they were mean and I—I hate that I made you feel bad about something you should be proud of. Because you should be proud. Your job is important and you're really good at it.
19  No, I know—I mean, I see how passionate you are when you talk about your projects. When you're not around me being an idiot about it. [quieter] I'm gonna stop with the comments, I promise. Like, completely done. No more jokes about it.
20  You deserve that. You deserve so much better than how I've been acting. And I—I wanna be better. I will be better. Your friendship means everything to me and I've been such a crappy friend lately. Can we—can we maybe start over with this?
21  I—okay, yeah, I did, but I tried calling you like five times. Your phone was off or dead or something, and we were gonna lose the whole opportunity if I didn't just—y'know, make the call.
22  Could've waited? Seriously? They gave us until noon to decide, and it was already eleven-thirty. I'm not gonna [scoff] throw away something we've been working on for months just because you didn't charge your phone.
23  Then what—what is the point? Because from where I'm standing, I made the best decision I could with the time we had. And honestly? I think you would've done the exact same thing.
24  And we were! We are! I mean—look look, I get that you're pissed, okay? But I literally had no other option. What was I supposed to do, let everything fall apart because I couldn't reach you for two hours?
25  That's all they gave us! God, you're acting like I—like I planned this or something. [frustrated laugh] I was freaking out trying to get hold of you. Ask Jamie, ask anyone who was there.
26  Of course I—yes, okay? Yes. They said noon, final offer, take it or leave it. And I'm sorry, but I wasn't gonna leave it. Not after everything we put into this.
27  That's not—I never said it was just me. Come on, don't twist my words. You know that's not what I meant. But somebody had to make the decision, and you weren't there.
28  What? I didn't—[pause] you didn't tell me that. How was I supposed to know that? All I knew was that you weren't answering, and I had like twenty minutes to decide our entire future.
29  Okay okay, fine. You wanna be mad, be mad. But I'm not gonna apologize for doing what I thought was right. Maybe—maybe I should've waited, I dunno, but in the moment? I did what made sense.
30  Yeah. [quieter] I guess we do. Look, I'm—I'm sorry about your mom, I really am. But you can't blame me for not knowing something you didn't tell me.
31  I know, I know! I'm so sorry, I just—something came up and I couldn't—okay that sounds terrible. Let me explain, please?
32  No no no, listen, it's not like that! My mom called and she needed me to drive her to the hospital—wait, that makes it sound worse than it was. She's fine! But her car broke down and she had an appointment and I just... I completely blanked on the moving thing. [nervous laugh] I should've texted you.
33  I know. God, I know, okay? I literally feel like the worst friend ever right now. You were counting on me and I just—I totally bailed. That's not... that's not who I wanna be, y'know?
34  Oh my god. Four flights? Jesus, I'm—I'm such an asshole. [groan] You must've been exhausted. I mean, I can't even imagine... actually wait, did you at least get someone else to help or was it really just you?
35  Okay I deserve that. I totally deserve that. But like, honestly? I'm gonna make this up to you. Whatever you need—unpacking, organizing, I'll buy you pizza for a month, I don't care. Just... please don't hate me forever?
36  You sure? Because you seem pretty—I mean, you have every right to be pissed. I would be too if someone flaked on me like that.
37  Can I—would it be okay if I came over now? I could bring dinner and help you unpack? Or just... sit there while you yell at me some more. Whatever you need, honestly. [sigh] I just really wanna fix this.
38  No, but I've got that heating pad you like? And um, those muscle relaxer things from when I threw out my shoulder? Plus I make a mean massage—wait, that's weird. I meant like, I could help with the heavy boxes that are left or whatever.
39  Yeah! The fancy one with like, all the settings and stuff. And I'll grab takeout from that Thai place you love—the one with the crazy spicy pad thai that basically destroys my mouth but you somehow eat like it's nothing?
40  Obviously! Oh thank god, yes, absolutely I'm paying. And next time you move—which hopefully isn't for like, a really long time—I'm gonna be there super early with coffee and donuts and like, an actual truck. I promise. No more flaking.
41  [muttering] Oh, come on. Five percent? Really? I just— I just checked this like an hour ago and it was at, um, it was at like thirty something. How does it just— [sigh] how does it just disappear like that? [slightly panicked] Okay, so, um, charger. Where's my— where's my charger? It's not in my bag, it's not— did I leave it at work? Oh god, please don't tell me I left it at work because that means I'm gonna be, like, completely cut off for the rest of the— [thinking out loud] Wait, okay, let me just— let me just think about this logically. I could, um, I could ask someone? But that's so awkward, like, "hey, can I borrow your charger" and then I'm just, uh, I'm just tethered to their wall for like an hour. [resigned] Or I could just— I could just let it die. I mean, people survived without phones for, like, thousands of years, right? It's not gonna kill me to be unreachable for a few hours. Probably. [second-guessing] But what if someone needs to— what if there's an emergency or something important and I just— [groan] why didn't I charge it last night?
42  [breathless] Oh my god, is that really you? [getting louder] I can't believe it's been three months! [nervous laugh] You look exactly the same, maybe even better—have you been working out or something?
43  [pleading tone] Just five minutes, please? [faster] I've been meaning to text you but didn't know what to say. [soft whimper] I still have your sweater at my place—the blue one you loved.
44  [trembling] Are you seeing someone? [accusatory] Is that why you're being so cold? [bitter laugh] I saw you tagged at that new restaurant last week—the one we always planned to try together.
45  [defensive shout] That was a mistake! [quieter now] I was confused and scared of how serious things were getting. [sniffling] Can't we just grab coffee sometime and talk like adults about everything?
46  [desperately] But what about our trip to Seattle? [rambling faster] The non-refundable tickets, the hotel reservations? [choking up] I know it's next month, but maybe we could still go as friends?
47  [wounded] You act like I'm some kind of monster. [more pitifully] All I did was love you too much. [whispered] Sometimes I drive by your apartment just to feel close to you again.
48  [frantic] Your friends still like me! [defensive tone] Rachel invited me to her party last week—I'm not some pariah. [softer] Maybe if you'd actually talk to me, I wouldn't have to reach out.
49  [crying now] I just miss what we had. [barely audible] Every morning I wake up expecting your texts. [desperate whisper] Don't you ever think about the good times—our Sunday brunches, movie marathons?
50  [angry outburst] How can you be so heartless? [accusingly] Two years together and you act like I'm nothing! [bitter] Did I really mean that little to you all along?
51  [defensive shout] It was one kiss! [quieter, ashamed] One stupid, drunken mistake at a party. [pleading again] People work through worse things—my parents did, yours did too, remember?
52  [defensive] Mr. Harrison, I prepared your return based on the documents you provided. [more firmly] You gave me receipts totaling $23,450 in business expenses, remember? [sighs] I can't verify what you don't show me.
53  [apologetically] The address error was... unfortunate, yes. [more calmly] But you wrote down 4521 Oak Avenue on your intake form, not Street. [pause] And the EIN issue—that came from your QuickBooks file you uploaded on March 15th.
54  [firmly] I said estimates were acceptable for small amounts, not... not for half your deductions! [exasperated] The IRS Form 4549 they sent shows you claimed 42,000 business miles. [slower] Where's your documentation for that?
55  [defensive tone] Mr. Harrison, being your preparer doesn't mean I can fabricate documentation. [more steadily] The audit notice CP2000 specifically questions three deposits of $15,000, $22,000, and $8,500. [carefully] You told me those were loans, but where's the paperwork?
56  [sympathetically] I understand you're stressed, but... listen, we need actual loan agreements. [more gently] The revenue agent, Ms. Chen, badge number RA-5569, she's requesting specific documentation. [reassuring] We can still fix this if you cooperate.
57  [briskly] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your account ending in 4782. [more quickly] You're currently at your credit limit of—let me see—eight thousand dollars. How can I help you today?
58  [surprised] Oh, you want to decrease your limit? [more gently] That's actually quite responsible of you. [quickly] Most people call asking for increases, so this is refreshing to hear, honestly.
59  [professionally] I completely understand your situation. [speaking rapidly] Let me pull up the options—we can reduce it to six thousand, four thousand, or even lower if you'd prefer. [reassuring] The change would be immediate.
60  [typing quickly] Three thousand it is—just need to confirm a few details first. [brisk tone] This is permanent until you request another change, and [pause] [carefully] any pending charges over the new limit will be declined.
61  [efficiently] Processing now... and done! [cheerfully] Your new limit is three thousand dollars effective immediately. [more seriously] You'll still owe the current balance of eight thousand, of course, but no new charges above three thousand.
62  [encouragingly] Exactly, and if you maintain your current payment schedule—let me check—[quickly] two hundred fifty monthly, you'll have significant progress within eighteen months. [helpfully] Would you like to discuss payment plan options?
63  [warmly] There's absolutely nothing to judge—you're taking control of your finances. [speaking faster] That takes real courage, and honestly, I wish more customers would make this choice. [professionally] Is there anything else?
64  [quickly] Absolutely, yes! [clearly] As long as you're below three thousand, the card functions normally. [reassuring] You're not closing the account, just setting a boundary for yourself.
65  [chuckles softly] Financial boundaries are actually a great place to begin! [briskly] I've noted everything in your account. [kindly] You should receive an email confirmation within the hour.
66  [supportively] Exactly, one step at a time. [more firmly] Focus on that eight thousand first. [warmly] We're here if you need anything else—payment arrangements, budget tools, whatever helps.
67  [Slow] Oh wow, Aunt Carol, that's, um, that's quite a story about your neighbor's cat. [Chuckle] [Fast] Hey, I actually gotta run to the store before it closes!
68  [Sigh] You know what, I'd love to hear the rest but my phone's about to—it's literally at like two percent right now.
69  [Happy] Wait, someone's at the door! [Shout] Coming! [Normal] Sorry, Uncle Ted, I really should get that.
70  [Disappointed] I hate to cut you off but, uh, the dog just threw up on the—oh god, it's everywhere. [Groan]
71  [Sarcastic] No, no, please tell me more about your coworker's daughter's wedding plans. [Tsk] Actually, sorry, I'm being called into another room.
72  [Fast] The timer just went off for my—I mean, I've got something in the oven that's gonna burn if I don't... [Laugh]
73  [Whisper] Mom's calling me on the other line and you know how she gets when I don't pick up. [Sigh] I should probably take this.
74  Well, this has been really—I mean, honestly, it's been great catching up, but work starts super early tomorrow, so...
75  [Sad] I'm getting such a bad headache, Grandma. [Slow] Maybe we could, um, maybe continue this another time?
76  [Angry] What? No, not you—sorry, the kids are just—[Shout] Put that down! [Fast] I really need to deal with this situation.
77  [Chuckle] You're gonna think I'm crazy but I actually forgot I have a, uh, a thing—an appointment thing in like ten minutes.
78  [Happy] Oh my goodness, yes, we should definitely do lunch soon! [Fast] But right now I'm kinda running late for—yeah, gotta go!
79  [Disappointed] The connection's getting really bad, I can barely—what? [Tsk] I think we're breaking up here.
80  [Slow] So basically what you're saying is—actually, hold that thought, someone's beeping in and it might be important. [Sigh]
81  [Sarcastic] Fascinating stuff about your grocery store experience, really. [Chuckle] But my boss just walked in, so...
82  I dunno, Uncle Ray, my ear's getting kinda sore from holding the phone this long, y'know?
83  [Whisper] The baby finally just fell asleep and I should probably—I mean, I need to ninja my way out of this room. [Slow] Really quietly.
84  [Happy] That reminds me! [Fast] I completely forgot I promised to call Jennifer back about—oh geez, she's gonna kill me if I don't call her now.
85  [Groan] Ugh, sorry, I just remembered I left the garage door open and it's supposed to rain. [Fast] Let me just—I'll call you back later?
86  [Sad] Listen, Dad, this has been nice but I'm just emotionally drained from today and I think I need to just... [Sigh] [Slow] decompress a little.
87  [frustrated] Oh my god, you should have seen this absolute maniac on the highway today. Like this guy just— he just cuts right in front of me, no warning, nothing, just [scoff] swoops right into my lane like I don't even exist. [annoyed] And I'm going like seventy already, right? So I have to slam on my brakes, and my coffee goes everywhere, and this guy just keeps weaving through traffic like he's in some kind of, I don't know, Fast and Furious movie or something. [getting worked up] Like what is wrong with people? Use your signal! It's literally right there on your steering wheel, it's not— it's not rocket science, you know? Just give people a heads up so they don't die. [indignant] So I'm following behind him for like ten minutes, just watching him pull the same crap with other cars, and I'm thinking this guy shouldn't even have a license, like— [pause] [quieter] Wait. Wait, hold on. When I changed lanes to get behind him... did I... [sheepish] [half laugh] Oh god. I didn't signal either, did I? I was so focused on being mad at him that I just— [groan] I totally did the exact same thing to the car behind me. [embarrassed] [small laugh] Okay, maybe we're both idiots. Maybe I should just... invest in more coffee lids and call it even.
88  I—okay, yes, I knew something was coming, but it wasn't like I had details or—I mean, I couldn't just tell you based on rumors, y'know?
89  That's not—[sigh] okay okay, I heard whispers three weeks ago, but nothing concrete until like, last Tuesday. And even then, I wasn't supposed to know. My manager literally made me promise not to say anything.
90  And my job is how I pay rent! Come on, you're acting like I—like I wanted this to happen. I've been losing sleep over this, trying to figure out if I should tell you or not.
91  That's really unfair. I tried to—look, I kept dropping hints, remember? I told you to update your resume, I said the company was being weird lately. [frustrated laugh] What did you think I meant?
92  Well I couldn't exactly spell it out! I'm sorry you're—no, actually, y'know what? I'm kinda frustrated too. You're making me the bad guy when management's the one who screwed you over.
93  Pretend? Are you—wow. Okay. That's what you think this is? Ten years of friendship and I'm suddenly pretending because I was in an impossible situation?
94  And lose my job too? Then we'd both be screwed. I mean—I get that you're hurt, I really do, but honestly? You're not even trying to—[groan] whatever. Fine. I should've risked everything to tell you something I barely knew myself.
95  That's easy to say when you're not the one who'd be violating an NDA. Look look, I'm sorry you found out this way, I am, but I was literally trying to protect both of us here.
96  By not making things worse! If I'd told you and you'd confronted them or—or started acting different, they would've known. We both would've been out immediately. Is that what you wanted?
97  And I wanted to give you one without destroying my entire career. [quieter] I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to do both. But I'm not gonna pretend I don't feel kinda betrayed too that you think I'd ever intentionally hurt you like this.
98  What? I'm not—I don't rewrite anything! I just remember things differently sometimes, that's all. Everyone does that, right? Memory isn't like, perfect or anything.
99  Wait wait wait, hold on—I didn't say drunk, I said you were tipsy! There's a difference and I—okay that's not the point. [nervous laugh] I shouldn't have said anything at all, I know.
100  Right, yeah, no no no, you're right. I think I got confused with another party maybe? Or I just—I dunno, sometimes stories get mixed up in my head and I don't mean to—
101  That's not—okay, I can see why you'd think that. But I swear I'm not doing it on purpose! My brain just kinda... fills in gaps sometimes? And then I believe my own version and—god, that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.
102  Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm—I'm so sorry. I never wanted to make you feel like that, I swear. That's like, literally the worst thing and I—[groan] I really messed up, didn't I?
103  Okay those—those were all misunderstandings! Except maybe the birthday thing, I definitely got that wrong. But I honestly thought I was remembering correctly! I wasn't trying to gaslight you or whatever, I just—my memory sucks sometimes.
104  Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I do that. I get all defensive and then I double down even when I'm probably—definitely wrong. It's this stupid thing where I can't admit I might be misremembering because then I feel like an idiot.
105  Fuck. When you put it like that—I mean, that's exactly what I've been doing, isn't it? [quieter] God, I'm such an asshole. No wonder you're mad at me.
106  I will. I promise I will. From now on if I'm not sure about something, I'll just—I'll say that, y'know? Like "hey, I might be wrong but" instead of acting like I have perfect recall. Because clearly I don't.
107  Really? You're—you're giving me another chance? Thank you, seriously. And next time just call me out immediately, okay? Like don't let me spiral into my weird false memory thing. Just be like "nope, that's not what happened" and I'll shut up.
108  Wait wait wait—you hit it? Like, the whole thing? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! How long has it been, like six months? Eight?
109  Fourteen—okay wow, that's some serious dedication right there. I mean, I can't even save for like, a weekend trip without accidentally [Laugh] buying something stupid online, y'know?
110  No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you minimize it! This is huge! Like, literally huge. What was it for again, the house thing or—?
111  Six months? That's so—honestly that's so smart. Most people don't even have like, six days saved, right? You must feel so... I dunno, secure? Free?
112  Weird how? Like good weird or—wait, are you okay? You don't seem as excited as I thought you'd—I mean, I'd be like, popping champagne or something [Chuckle].
113  Oh. Oh, I totally get that. It's like when you finish a really long show and you're just kinda... lost? But hey, this is—this is the fun part now, right?
114  Yeah! Like, you can actually think about other goals without that hanging over you. Maybe something actually fun this time? Travel or—ooh, or that photography thing you mentioned?
115  Okay but—but you were so into it! And now you've got this cushion, so if you wanted to like, take a class or buy decent equipment, you totally could without the guilt.
116  Well, start thinking! This is—god, I'm so proud of you, seriously. Most people just talk about doing this stuff but you actually [Sigh] did it, y'know?
117  Um, we're definitely celebrating though. Like, I don't care if you think it's not a big deal—we're getting dinner. The good place, not the sketchy taco truck. Although... actually the taco truck sounds pretty good too.
118  Wait, what? No, that's—I thought you knew! Marcus said he was gonna tell you like, weeks ago. I literally assumed you just couldn't make it or something.
119  Okay but—how is that my fault? I'm not the one organizing it. Jake's been handling all the—the group chat stuff, and I just figured... [sigh] I mean, you're always in the loop about everything.
120  Come on, that's not—you're acting like I deliberately excluded you. I didn't even make the group chat! I got added to it like, three days after it started.
121  I—okay, yeah, maybe I could've, but honestly? You've been so busy lately, barely responding to texts, and I just... I dunno, I thought maybe you were taking a break from group stuff. [frustrated laugh] Which apparently was the wrong assumption.
122  No! That's not—god, you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're making it sound like there was this big conspiracy to leave you out, and that's literally not what happened.
123  And they all probably thought the same thing I did! We—I mean, you know how these things go, everyone assumes someone else handled it. It's not great, I know that, but it's not personal.
124  Well it wasn't meant to be! Jesus, I—[scoff] I'm sorry you got left out, okay? I am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you think I'd do that to you on purpose. Like, really? After everything?
125  I didn't—we barely hung out those three weeks! You cancelled on coffee twice, and when we did text it was about your work drama. When was I supposed to casually bring up a trip I thought you already knew about?
126  Okay okay, fine. You're right. I should've—I should've brought it up. But you gotta understand, I wasn't trying to hide it from you. That's... that's what's killing me here. You think I was being shady and I just... wasn't.
127  Yeah. We were. And I—look, I fucked up by assuming, alright? But you're not exactly blameless here either. You've been MIA for weeks, and now you wanna act like we're terrible friends for not chasing you down? That's not... [trails off] Whatever. I don't know what you want me to say.
128  Wait wait wait—THE internship? The one you were like, totally convinced you wouldn't get? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
129  I'm—okay I'm literally about to scream. This is huge! Like, this is the one at the place with the—with all the fancy people, right? [Gasp] When do you start?
130  Three—okay that's soon. That's really soon. But like, they're helping with that stuff, right? Housing and everything? Because honestly, that's kinda fast to just pack up and—
131  Of course they do, because you're—I mean, they'd be stupid not to. God, I'm so proud of you. Like, genuinely. You worked your ass off for this.
132  No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay it. This is literally, what, like a thousand people applied? And they picked YOU. [Laugh] That's not "just" anything.
133  Twelve hun—see? SEE? That's even more insane! Are you, like... are you excited? You seem kinda... I dunno, quiet about it.
134  Yeah, no, totally—that makes sense. It's like, even good stuff can be overwhelming, y'know? The whole moving thing and starting somewhere new and... yeah.
135  Oh, babe. Okay, um—can I be real with you for a sec? They don't just randomly pick people. Like, they saw something in you that—[Sigh] that maybe you don't see yet.
136  And? So what? You're gonna—you're gonna show up and be yourself and that's literally why they wanted you. Not some, like, cookie-cutter Ivy League robot, y'know?
137  I'm always right about this stuff. Honestly though? You're gonna kill it. And I'm gonna need, like, weekly updates because I'll be living vicariously through you.
138  [muttering] Okay, so I'm, um, I'm almost there and I just— [sigh] where's my cup? My reusable cup thing? I literally, like, I literally put it right by my keys last night so I wouldn't— so I wouldn't forget it again. [slightly annoyed] But it's not— it's not in my bag, obviously, because that would be, um, that would be too easy. [tsk] I can just picture it sitting there on my, uh, on my kitchen counter, looking all smug and— and unused. [resigned] I mean, I could go back, but that's like a fifteen minute detour and I'm already, um, I'm already running kind of late for the thing. Plus the barista's gonna judge me, right? Like, "Oh, here's this person again with no cup." [thoughtful] Although, wait— do they even care? I feel like they probably see this, um, this exact situation like fifty times a day. It's not that deep. [brightening] You know what, I'll just— I'll just get the paper cup today and try to, uh, try to remember tomorrow. It's fine. It's literally fine. One cup isn't gonna destroy the planet.
139  [nervously] Hi Marcus, thanks for meeting with me. [clearing throat] I know this transition has been... complicated. [quieter] I really value your experience here, and I'd love to discuss how we can work together moving forward.
140  [defensive] Look, I didn't ask for this promotion over you. [softer] But I'm here now, and we need to make this work. [steadier voice] Can we at least try to find some common ground professionally?
141  [frustrated sigh] This isn't about degrees, Marcus! [pleading] I need your help—I'm drowning here. [whispered admission] I don't even understand half the technical stuff you built, and everyone expects me to just know it all.
142  [exhausted laugh] I'm too tired to pretend anymore. [desperately] Yesterday I accidentally deleted a client database thinking it was a test file. [panicked whisper] IT recovered it, but I nearly had a heart attack waiting.
143  [relieved giggle] Jerry turned three different shades of purple. [more seriously] But Marcus, this is exactly why I need you. [genuine tone] Would you consider being technical lead? Same team, but you'd own all system architecture decisions.
144  [eagerly] Yes, exactly that! [laughing] God, I hate those quarterly reviews too. [confidentially] Last week Henderson talked for forty minutes about synergy. [groaning] I wanted to throw myself out the conference room window.
145  [firmly] Completely serious. [hopeful] You know the systems, I'll handle the politics. [quieter and sincere] Plus, between us, your salary adjustment would reflect the expanded role—I already got it pre-approved before asking you here.
146  [excited] Monday, if you're on board! [quickly] I've already drafted the org chart changes. [nervous again] Though I should warn you, Peterson from accounting is furious about the budget increase—he might corner you.
147  [relief washing over] Thank God, I thought you'd say no. [firmly] Zero micromanaging, I promise. [lighter] Honestly, I'll be too busy trying to understand what you're doing to interfere anyway. [pause] That's a joke. Mostly.
148  [vulnerably] Thank you for saying that, Marcus. [steadying breath] I know I have a lot to learn from you. [determined] But I promise I'll also have your back with upper management—that's something I actually am good at.
149  I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me pull up your account using that warranty number—DW-78342-K, correct? [concerned] I see here we've serviced your unit on July 15th and September 2nd.
150  Sir, I'm going to personally escalate this to our senior technician team. We have an opening tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM or—wait, actually—I can squeeze you in today at 4:15 PM.
151  [sympathetically] I wish I could send someone immediately, Mr. Chen. But our technician, Marcus, badge number T-4421, can definitely fix this before your party. [encouraging] He's our most experienced specialist with a 98% first-visit resolution rate.
152  [professionally] Given your situation, I'm authorizing a full unit replacement if today's repair doesn't hold. [more confidently] I'm adding override code RX-9000-PRIORITY to your file right now. This shouldn't have happened three times, and we're going to make it right.
153  Marcus will receive your service ticket immediately with high priority status. [earnestly] I'm also crediting your account $200 for the inconvenience—confirmation code CR-7734-M. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Chen?
154  I'm noting that specifically—DLX-500, error code E4 on the digital display. Marcus will bring replacement parts for the control board and heating element, which are the usual culprits. We'll get this resolved today.
155  Marcus has twelve years with our company and specializes in the DLX series. I see tech B-3356's notes were... limited, which isn't acceptable. [more seriously] I'm documenting everything in your file for our quality assurance team to review.
156  Absolutely, you can reach me directly at extension 4-0-9-2, ask for Sarah, employee ID S-1147. [sincerely] I'll be here until 8 PM tonight, and I'll personally follow up tomorrow morning. [determined] We're going to solve this.
157  Marcus will be there at 4:15 sharp—I'm sending him your gate code 7-7-3-9 right now. He'll call you at the number ending in 8845 when he's ten minutes away. Your dinner party won't be affected, I promise.
158  I completely agree, Mr. Chen, three breakdowns is unacceptable. After Marcus completes the repair, I'll personally ensure your replacement unit is pre-authorized and ready if needed. Thank you for your patience, and Marcus will see you at 4:15.
159  Good afternoon, I see you're contacting us about a return issue. Let me pull up your account here and—oh, I'm seeing two previous attempts. Can you tell me what happened?
160  I completely understand your frustration, truly. Looking at the notes here... um, it seems there was a processing error on our end. Let me escalate this right now to make sure it doesn't happen again.
161  You're absolutely right to be upset. Here's what I'm doing differently—I'm personally flagging this for manual review and, uh, bypassing the automated system entirely. Would you prefer a full refund or store credit with an additional 20% bonus?
162  Processing the refund right now as we speak. [quickly] You'll see it in 3-5 business days, and I'm—I'm also emailing you a prepaid return label that's priority tracked. This one goes directly to our special returns department.
163  The previous labels went through standard returns, which... which apparently had a glitch with your order code. This one has a override code that I've personally attached. It cannot be redirected back to you.
164  Exactly, and I've added a note for free pickup service if you prefer. [briskly] The driver will come tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM, or—or you can drop it off yourself. [cheerfully] Whatever's easier for you after this hassle.
165  Absolutely! You'll get three confirmations actually—pickup, facility arrival, and refund processed. I'm also sending you my direct extension in case, um, in case anything goes sideways. But it won't.
166  It will work, I guarantee it. Between you and me, I've flagged this as a priority case because three attempts is—is completely unacceptable. Is there anything else I can help with today?
167  [reassuringly] Oh, absolutely not! I'm adding a detailed note explaining the situation, and actually—actually I'm adding a loyalty credit to your account for the inconvenience. [firmly] Your account standing is perfect.
168  That's exactly what we want to hear. You'll receive all the confirmation emails within the next five minutes, including my direct line. Thank you for your patience through this whole ordeal.
169  [Angry] Look, I don't care what everyone thinks—pineapple on pizza is actually, like, the perfect combination of sweet and savory, okay? [Tsk]
170  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because the majority is always right about everything. [Laugh] Remember when everyone thought the earth was flat?
171  [Fast] I've done the research, I've looked at the data, and honestly the numbers don't—they just don't lie about this stuff. [Defensive]
172  [Whisper] Between you and me, I think deep down, um, people actually agree but they're too scared to admit it. [Sigh]
173  [Happy] You know what? I'm glad I believe this! [Laugh] It makes me different and I kinda like standing out from the crowd.
174  [Slow] The thing is... nobody wants to hear it because it challenges what they've believed their whole lives, y'know? [Disappointed]
175  [Shout] Would you just let me finish my point before you—before you jump all over me about it? [Groan]
176  [Sad] I used to keep quiet about it, but I'm just, I'm tired of pretending I agree when I really, really don't. [Sigh]
177  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, another person telling me I'm wrong without actually listening to my reasoning—how original.
178  [Fast] [Happy] Actually wait, wait, wait—I found three studies that basically prove what I'm saying, so it's not just me being weird!
179  [Disappointed] I mean, I thought you of all people would at least, like, try to understand where I'm coming from. [Tsk]
180  [Angry] [Fast] This is exactly why I don't usually bring it up because everyone gets all—they get defensive and won't even consider it!
181  [Chuckle] Honestly? In ten years everyone's gonna pretend they believed this all along. [Sarcastic] Mark my words.
182  [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm actually wrong, but then I remember... no, no, the evidence is there.
183  [Slow] You're allowed to disagree, but, um, dismissing it without even thinking about it? [Disappointed] [Sigh] That's just closed-minded.
184  [Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, finally someone who's willing to actually discuss it instead of just laughing at me!
185  [Groan] Here we go again—I mention it once and suddenly I'm the, the crazy person in the room. [Angry]
186  [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, let's all just believe the same thing forever and never question anything—that sounds super healthy for society.
187  [Sad] [Slow] I dunno, maybe I'm just seeing something that... that other people can't see yet, or won't see.
188  [Shout] It's not stupid! [Angry] [Fast] Just because it's different doesn't mean—ugh, why do I even bother trying to explain anymore?
189  [casual] Oh, so I was working on my novel today—you know, the one I've been plugging away at for like three years now? And my laptop started making this weird clicking sound. [light laugh] Like, really weird. So I'm thinking, okay, time to maybe get this checked out before it dies on me completely. [matter-of-fact] But whatever, right? I mean, everything's backed up to the cloud anyway. I set that up ages ago when I first started writing seriously. Plus I'm pretty sure I copied everything to that external drive at some point. [slightly concerned] Actually, let me just double-check real quick... [pause] Hm. Okay, so the cloud thing—apparently I have like two gigabytes of storage and I used it all up in 2019? And it just... stopped backing up? [growing worried] And this external drive... [nervous laugh] this is just photos. This is all photos from college. Where's my—where are my documents? [panic building] Wait, wait, wait. When did I last actually save this anywhere else? I've been writing on the same laptop for... [sharp exhale] Oh god. Oh no. [spiraling] [frantic] Three years! Three years of writing! Sixty thousand words! I never—I just assumed—who doesn't back things up?! [hysterical laugh] Me! I don't back things up! What kind of writer am I?! [full panic] It's all gone! It's all just... sitting on a dying hard drive and I'm—[whimper]—I'm gonna lose everything!
190  Got—wait, got what? Oh my god, oh my god, is this about the thing? The promotion thing? Because if it is, I'm literally gonna scream right now.
191  SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up—are you serious? [Gasp] This is the one you've been waiting for since, what, like 2019? Maybe longer?
192  Okay that's—that's actually insane. Six years. Six whole years of them just... dangling it, y'know? And now it's yours. How are you even feeling right now?
193  Tired? Oh babe, no no no, that's just—I mean, yeah, of course you're exhausted. You've been basically running on fumes waiting for this. But like... also proud? Happy? Anything?
194  A sad desk—[Laugh] okay that's weirdly perfect though? Like you've probably eaten a thousand sad desk salads waiting for this call, right? This is poetic justice or whatever.
195  Oh she's gonna—wait, she's gonna lose it. Hasn't she been asking about this literally every Sunday dinner? "Any news about the job, honey?" That whole thing?
196  Well now you can finally—actually, y'know what? Now you can be like "Yeah Mom, actually there IS news" and just... drop it on her. [Chuckle] She's gonna cry, isn't she?
197  Okay but this is different—this is her baby getting recognized for being, like, absolutely incredible at what they do. Because that's what this is, right? Validation. Finally.
198  Feel the—oh honey, no. That's not weird at all. It's like... you've been in limbo for so long that normal probably feels bizarre right now, y'know? When do you actually start?
199  Monday? That's—wait that's in like three days! Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating this weekend then. And I mean properly celebrating, not just... sitting there looking shell-shocked while I drink champagne at you.
200  Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? The big one? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
201  A full—okay, um, excuse me? [Gasp] That's literally life-changing! Why are you being so calm about this? I'd be like, screaming or crying or—honestly probably both.
202  No no no, that's—that's totally fair actually. It's huge, y'know? Like when something this good happens it's almost... surreal? Did they call you or—how'd you find out?
203  You almost—oh my god, imagine. That would've been... [Laugh] okay that's actually terrifying to think about. But like, you checked it! You got it! This is everything you worked for, right?
204  Babe, what? No—you're literally the smartest person I know. All those late nights, all that stress... I mean, they saw what everyone else sees, y'know?
205  Three thou—okay and they picked YOU. Out of three thousand! That's like—that's insane odds. Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it.
206  You wanted to—[Chuckle] stop, I'm gonna cry. That's so sweet. But also like, call them! Right now! They've been worried about tuition for months, haven't they?
207  She's gonna—oh god she's gonna sob. Happy tears this time though. This changes everything for you guys, doesn't it? Like, no more stress about loans or working three jobs or—
208  Okay but—but you'll still eat ramen with me sometimes, right? [Laugh] Like, for nostalgia? When you're all successful and scholarship-y?
209  Um, duh, because I actually add vegetables. But seriously though—I'm so, so proud of you. You deserve this more than anyone, and I just... yeah. You did it, babe.
210  [settling in, anticipatory] Okay, so, um, I've got my snacks, I've got my— my blanket, and I'm ready to, uh, to finally watch the next episode of— wait. [pause] Where is it? Where's, um, where's the show? [confused, muttering] I mean, it was literally right here yesterday, like, right in my "Continue Watching" thing. Let me just, uh— let me scroll down, maybe it's in, um, in my list somewhere? But that's— that's weird, right? [slightly annoyed] Oh, come on. [sigh] Did they— did they seriously remove it? Like, mid-season? Who does that? I was, uh, I was literally three episodes away from finishing and now it's just— [scoff] gone? [frustrated, talking faster] This is, um, this is exactly why I don't get attached to shows on streaming anymore. They just, like, they just yank them away when you're— when you're invested and— [groan] great. Cool. Perfect timing. [resigned, slightly sarcastic] Well, I guess I'm, uh, I'm finding a new show tonight. Or, I mean, I could always just, um, just stare at my ceiling. That's, uh— that's also an option. [exhale] Fantastic.
211  [nervously] So I wrapped Mom's gift last night, the silk scarf from that boutique downtown. [speeding up] You know, the one with the peacock pattern she kept eyeing? [Soft giggle] Cost me half my paycheck but totally worth it.
212  [Shrieking laugh] No no no no NO! [breathlessly] This cannot be happening! We literally live in different cities and somehow bought the [voice cracking] SAME scarf? [Snort] Mom's going to think we coordinated this like five-year-olds!
213  [whimpering] The receipt's at home and the party's in two hours. [more frantically] Maybe we could say it's intentional? Like, [sarcastically sweet] "Oh Mom, we got you matching scarves so you'll never lose one!" [Groaning laugh]
214  [relieved shout] YES! Do that! [more calmly] Actually no, traffic's horrible right now with the parade. [defeated] You'd never make it back. [Bitter chuckle] We're stuck being the twins who can't gift separately.
215  [through tears] Stop making me laugh, my mascara's running! [Hiccupping giggle] Dad's going to roast us forever about this. [mimicking deep voice] "Six hundred dollars for one scarf, impressive economics girls!" [more hysterically] We're never hearing the end!
216  [giggling uncontrollably] You know what though? [more warmly] At least we both noticed what she wanted. [softly] That's pretty sweet actually. [Snorting] Even if we're complete disasters at coordinating surprise gifts between us.
217  [mock serious] Spreadsheet? We need a whole database at this point! [getting louder] Password protected, encrypted, with two-factor authentication! [Cackling] "Sarah's Gift Security System" has a nice ring to it, [teasingly] don't you think?
218  [gleefully] We could make it a competition! [faster] "Mom, judge which daughter wrapped theirs better!" [melodramatically] "Which peacock speaks to your soul more deeply?" [Shrieking giggle] Turn our disaster into performance art, why not?
219  [suddenly hopeful] Wait that's TRUE! [excitedly building] She literally wore three necklaces to brunch last week! [triumphant] We didn't buy duplicates, we bought her a matching SET! [Victorious cackle] We're geniuses! Accidental fashion-forward gift-giving geniuses!
220  [mischievously] Let's tie them together into one mega-scarf! [Wheezing] Six feet of peacock glory wrapped around her! [more seriously] But honestly? [sweetly] She'll probably cry happy tears anyway because we both thought of her.
221  Mrs. Henderson, our records indicate you've missed eleven consecutive payments totaling $18,947.33. The property at 1847 Maple Street is, um, significantly underwater, and we've already extended the grace period twice beyond standard protocol.
222  The modification department reviewed your file, reference number MOD-7745-XJ2, on September 15th. [more firmly] Your debt-to-income ratio of 78% exceeds our threshold, and frankly, Mrs. Henderson, we're a business, not a charity organization.
223  The original loan agreement, document LN-2014-8823-A, clearly states the consequences of default. Section 14, paragraph 3B specifically outlines the acceleration clause that, well, you apparently didn't read before signing.
224  Four thousand five hundred against nearly nineteen thousand? That's barely 23% of what you owe, and promises about Friday money don't, um, don't satisfy legal obligations or court orders.
225  All correspondence was sent per regulation Z, compliance code CFR-1026.41. Mrs. Henderson, you've had since notice date 08/22/2023 to respond, and verbal assurances don't override written contracts—that's just how it works.
226  Credit reporting is automated through TransUnion, reference TU-445-MMC. Your score dropped because you stopped paying, not—not because we're vindictive, and market conditions have changed since your initial inquiry, obviously.
227  [condescendingly] Market valuations from, um, from eight months ago are irrelevant now. The current BPO report, file BPO-9834-Z, estimates $241,000, and that's assuming optimal conditions which, frankly, don't exist anymore.
228  Past payment history doesn't negate current contractual violations under UCC 9-607. [more coldly] The investors holding your note, portfolio PF-2014-Q4-8823, they require us to to pursue all remedies outlined in the security instrument.
229  Those programs expired in 2018 and 2016 respectively, ma'am. Your applications were submitted, well, two years too late, and current FHA guidelines under case FH-9923-C don't apply to conventional loans anyway.
230  The eviction date is November 30th, per court order CV-2023-8847. You'll receive the cash-for-keys offer, document CFK-9902, for $3,000 if you, um, if you vacate without damage by November 15th.
231  Good afternoon, Bella's Bouquets and Events, this is Sandra speaking. How can I help make your special day perfect?
232  Okay, let's take this one step at a time. I have your file right here—the Morrison wedding, June fifteenth, correct? Tell me about the backyard space we're working with.
233  We can absolutely make adjustments. The round centerpieces won't work on rectangular tables, but—here's the good news—[optimistically] we can redesign them as gorgeous runners with the same flowers, actually saves you about three hundred dollars.
234  Right, the white rose arch with peonies. For a backyard setting, I'd suggest repositioning it as your ceremony backdrop instead. Actually, against natural greenery, it'll photograph even better than in that beige ballroom.
235  Rustic is only if you want it to be. We'll add some elegant touches—crystal drops on the arch, maybe upgrade to gold-rimmed vases? [briskly] I can email you photos of our premium outdoor setups right now.
236  We've done hundreds of summer outdoor events. We'll deliver everything later, keep them in coolers until setup, and I'll personally spray them with anti-wilt treatment. Your flowers will look fresh all evening, I promise.
237  LED candles, battery-operated, they even flicker realistically. [enthusiastically] No fire hazard, no melting wax, and honestly, they photograph identically to real ones. I'll swap those out at no extra charge since it's our venue change policy.
238  That's what we're here for. So let me recap the changes—twelve rectangular runners instead of twenty round centerpieces, arch relocated for ceremony backdrop, LED candles in the candelabras. Anything else worrying you?
239  Those stay exactly the same, don't worry. Personal flowers are completely independent of venue. [more briskly] I'll have the revised contract ready by tomorrow morning with the new total, which is actually four hundred less than your original.
240  That's wonderful news for your budget! Listen, I'll also include our emergency day-of contact number. If anything comes up, even the morning of, we have a rapid response team ready.
241  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another story about your promotion—I mean, it's not like I've been trying to tell you about my dad's surgery for twenty minutes. [Tsk]
242  [Fast] You know what, I'm just gonna—actually, never mind, you're clearly not listening anyway. [Sigh]
243  [Disappointed] I literally just asked if you wanted to hear about my trip and you somehow made it about your ex-boyfriend again. [Slow]
244  [Whisper] Do you ever, um, do you ever wonder what's going on in other people's lives? [Sad] Like, at all?
245  [Happy] Wait wait wait—you actually just asked me a question about myself! [Laugh] This is like, historic!
246  [Angry] I'm sorry, but I gotta interrupt here because this is the fifth time today you've told me about your CrossFit routine. [Groan]
247  [Slow] So basically what you're saying is that, uh, everything I experience reminds you of something better that happened to you? [Sarcastic]
248  [Shout] Can we please—PLEASE—have one conversation that doesn't circle back to your dating life? [Tsk]
249  [Chuckle] You know, I was gonna tell you I got engaged, but sure, let's talk about your new haircut for another hour. [Sarcastic]
250  [Fast] Okay so like, remember when I said my mom was sick and you immediately started talking about your yoga instructor? [Disappointed] Yeah, that kinda hurt.
251  [Sad] I just... I dunno, I thought friends were supposed to, you know, care about each other's stuff? [Sigh]
252  [Angry] No no no, don't even try to—you literally haven't asked me a single question all night! [Fast]
253  [Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if you'd even notice if I just... stopped showing up. [Slow] [Sad]
254  [Happy] Oh my god, you're right, MY problems don't matter because YOU had a rough day at brunch! [Sarcastic] [Laugh]
255  [Disappointed] I mean, I guess I could just record myself talking and you probably wouldn't know the difference, right? [Tsk]
256  [Shout] I GOT FIRED TODAY! [Slow] There, I said it—now can we actually talk about it?
257  [Chuckle] It's kinda impressive how you can turn literally any topic into something about yourself—like, that's a talent. [Sarcastic]
258  [Fast] You wanna know something funny? I've been making stuff up about my life just to see if you're even—yeah, you're not listening now either. [Sigh]
259  [Sad] I used to think you were just, um, enthusiastic about sharing, but now I'm starting to think you genuinely don't see me. [Disappointed]
260  [Angry] Honestly? I'm done pretending this is a friendship when it's basically just me being your unpaid therapist. [Groan] [Fast] I'm out.
261  [casual] So, um, I had one of those nights last night where I, uh, I couldn't sleep and ended up, like, online shopping at like 2 AM. [light laugh] You know how it is, right? I think I ordered some, um, some stuff for the apartment or whatever. Nothing crazy. [conversational] Actually, let me just— let me check what I, uh, what I actually got because I honestly don't really remember. [nervous laugh] I was pretty tired and just, like, clicking around, you know? [slight concern] Okay so, um, I'm looking at my email and there's— there's definitely more confirmations than I thought there would be. Like, uh, like several more. Which is... that's probably not great. [growing worry] Oh no. Oh, um, oh no no no. There's a— there's a confirmation here for a, uh, a "deluxe herb garden kit"? And then another one for— [exhales] for what looks like a, um, a vintage record player? What was I— why would I need— [panic building] Wait, there's more. There's, uh, there's a stand mixer, and— oh my god— a, um, a forty-seven dollar throw pillow that's apparently "artisanally crafted"? What does that even— who spends forty-seven dollars on a— [full panic] The total is— [whimper] the total is six hundred and thirty-two dollars! Six hundred! I don't— I don't have six hundred dollars for, um, for random garbage I don't need! What is wrong with me? I can't— I can't afford to be this stupid at 2 AM!
262  Okay, that's—that's not what happened. I didn't make her hide, she just ran when I kinda jumped back. I wasn't trying to scare her, I was literally just startled when she came at me.
263  Yeah well, I don't speak cat, okay? And you know—you KNOW I'm not good with animals. [frustrated laugh] But you're acting like I kicked her or something, which is honestly really unfair.
264  I didn't—okay okay, I raised my voice a little, but that's because she was climbing my leg! With claws! I'm sorry but that's a totally normal reaction when you're scared of something.
265  Right, and I get that it's your space, but like—you invited me over knowing how I am with pets. I mean, you could've at least warned me she was gonna be all over me the second I walked in.
266  Telling me you have a cat and preparing me for—for whatever that was are two different things. Look look, I'm trying here, I really am, but animals just freak me out and you've known this since forever. [sigh]
267  That's not—come on, don't twist my words. I wanna hang out with you, obviously, but maybe we could just... I dunno, put her in another room next time? Is that really such a huge ask?
268  Wow. Okay. So we're—we're going there now. Fine fine, but you're basically choosing your cat over your friend, which is... y'know what, whatever. I'm not gonna compete with a pet.
269  I said the fur on my jacket was—ugh, you're taking everything out of context! I have allergies, remember? Or did you conveniently forget that part while you're busy making me the villain here?
270  Okay so maybe I exaggerated a little about the allergies but that's because—because I didn't wanna hurt your feelings about being scared! [scoff] Guess that backfired, huh? I was trying to spare your feelings and now you're acting like I'm some kinda monster.
271  Yeah, I'm—I'm gonna go. But honestly? This is really disappointing. Like, I've been your friend for six years and you're ready to throw that away because I'm not great with your cat. That's... yeah. That's really something.
272  Oh god, okay—I can explain. I thought—I honestly thought you knew already! Like, everyone was talking about it and I just assumed—wait, that's not—[nervous laugh] I'm making this worse, aren't I?
273  No no no, that came out wrong. I didn't—I meant to tell you, I swear I did. But then it got weird because like, so much time had passed and I didn't know how to bring it up without it being this whole thing.
274  I know, I know. God, I'm such an idiot. I literally had like five different chances to mention it and I just—I kept chickening out because I knew you'd be upset that I hadn't said anything earlier, y'know?
275  Yeah. Which was—that was stupid. Really, really stupid. [Sigh] I don't even have a good excuse, honestly. I just kept putting it off and then suddenly it was Friday and everyone was getting ready and I realized how badly I'd messed up.
276  What? No—I mean, I didn't even really—I left early actually. I kept thinking about how you should've been there and it just felt wrong, you know? Like the whole night was kinda ruined because I knew I'd screwed up.
277  I deserve that. I do. But like—can I just say that it wasn't intentional? I would never deliberately exclude you from something, that's not—that's not who I am. Or who I wanna be. [Groan] I just handled this whole thing so badly.
278  I'm gonna—I'll make sure you know about everything from now on, okay? Like, even the stupid stuff. Even if I think you already know. I'll be that annoying friend who texts you about every single thing because I never want you to feel like this again.
279  No but I'm serious! I really—I hate that I made you feel left out. That's like, literally one of the worst feelings and I should've—I should've been a better friend. I'm sorry. Really, genuinely sorry.
280  You're right. You're totally right. It would've taken me like two seconds and I just—I overthought it, I guess? Made it this huge deal in my head when it didn't need to be. Classic me, making everything way more complicated than it needs to be. [nervous laugh]
281  I will. I promise I will. And um—there's actually this thing next weekend at Sarah's place if you wanna—sorry, see? I'm telling you! That's me being better already. Do you maybe wanna come? We could go together?
282  I know, I know, okay? The highway was literally a parking lot. There was this massive accident and they shut down two lanes—I couldn't even get off at an exit for like twenty minutes.
283  I did text! I sent you like three messages saying I was stuck. Check your phone. [frustrated laugh] I mean, what else was I supposed to do, abandon my car?
284  Okay, but how is that—look, I'm sorry about the reservation, but you're acting like I planned this. I left early, actually. I gave myself extra time and everything just went to hell anyway.
285  That's not—come on, that's not fair. When was the last time I was late? Seriously, tell me. Because I'm pretty sure I'm usually the one waiting for you half the time.
286  That was fifteen minutes! And I told you ahead of time my meeting was running over. This is different—this was literally [groan] an act of God or whatever. You can check the traffic reports if you don't believe me.
287  Okay okay, I get that you're pissed, but I was sitting in traffic going insane too, y'know? Like, you think I wanted to be stuck behind some guy's bumper stickers for forty minutes? I was stressed the whole time.
288  I—what? I just told you I left early! I gave myself like an extra twenty minutes, which is usually plenty. But apparently everyone decided to crash their cars today, so...
289  Oh, so now you think I'm lying? That's—wow, okay. You know what, I'm trying to explain what happened, but if you just wanna be mad, then fine. Be mad.
290  Tired of what, exactly? Traffic? Because yeah, me too. Or tired of—look look, I said I was sorry about the reservation. But honestly? You're being kinda unreasonable about something I literally couldn't control.
291  No, not whatever. I drove through hell to get here and you're treating me like I—[sigh] Fine. Let's go. But this isn't fair and you know it.
292  Do what? What are you even—I don't know what you're talking about. We were just hanging out, having a good time, and now you're acting like I committed some crime or something.
293  Yeah, and? I was happy for her! I literally said congrats like three times. But then everyone started talking about work stuff and I just—I dunno, I joined the conversation. That's what people do.
294  Okay okay, but she asked me about it! [scoff] She literally said "how's the job search going" and I answered. Was I supposed to just... not answer? That would've been weird.
295  It wasn't—come on, it wasn't twenty minutes. Maybe like five. And everyone seemed interested! They were asking questions and I was just... I mean, I thought we were having a conversation, y'know?
296  Don't do that. Don't just "sure" me like I'm some kind of—look, I get that you think I talk too much sometimes, but honestly? Sometimes it feels like you're keeping score or something. [frustrated laugh] Like you're just waiting for me to mess up.
297  Of what? Of me having insecurities? Of me being human? I'm sorry I'm not perfect like—okay, that's not fair, but neither is this. You're acting like I do this maliciously when really I'm just trying to connect with people.
298  That's—that's not what I'm doing. Or I mean, maybe sometimes it seems that way, but it's not on purpose. When I get nervous I just... I talk. And yeah, I talk about myself because that's what I know. [sigh] It's not because I think I'm so interesting.
299  Because I'm scared, okay? I'm scared that if I don't say something, anything, people are gonna realize I don't actually belong there. That I'm just—I dunno, faking it or whatever. So yeah, I overcompensate. I know I do.
300  I didn't mean to steal it. I really didn't. But also like—she got her moment! Everyone congratulated her, we toasted, the whole thing. I just... after that, I thought it was okay to share too. Apparently I was wrong.
301  Yeah well, you always think it's not. Maybe—maybe instead of getting all cold and angry every time, you could just... tell me? In the moment? Instead of letting me go on and then hating me for it later. That's kinda unfair too, y'know?
302  Wait wait wait—everything? Like, your entire shop? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! When did this happen?
303  I'm literally—okay, I'm getting goosebumps right now. This is huge! How are you feeling? You must be like, completely freaking out, right?
304  Weird how? Like good weird or—actually no, I get it. It's probably super overwhelming. Did you see it happening in real time?
305  [Laugh] Of course you thought it was broken! That's so—wait, how many pieces are we talking about here?
306  Forty—okay, um, that's basically your entire winter collection, right? Holy shit. Do you know what triggered it? Like was there a—did someone share it or something?
307  An influencer? Which one? Oh my god, you're gonna—you're gonna need to make so much more stuff now. [Groan] Your poor hands!
308  Oh no no no, that's—okay that's actually stressful. How long is that gonna take you? Do you need help? I can totally come over and like, help you pack things or whatever.
309  We're going to—I'm literally grabbing my keys right now. We're gonna hit up every shipping store in town, okay? This is like, this is your moment!
310  I mean, yeah, of course it doesn't! You just went from, what—selling a few pieces a week to boom, cleaned out? That's gotta be absolutely mind-blowing. Are you happy though? Like underneath all the—the panic?
311  You should be! This is—honestly? This is exactly what you deserve. [Softer] You've been working so hard on this stuff, and people finally noticed. That's not luck, babe. That's just... you being amazing at what you do.
312  [muttering] Okay, so I finally got this thing, and now I just need to— oh. Oh, come on. [sigh] "Batteries not included." Of course. Of course they're not included. [slightly annoyed] I mean, why would they— why would they make it easy, right? It's like, um, it's a flashlight. It literally needs batteries to, uh, to function. That's the whole— that's the whole point of a flashlight. [thinking out loud] So now I need to— I need to figure out what kind of batteries. Let me just— [pause] double A? Triple A? Wait, where does it even— oh, here we go. "Requires four double A batteries." [resigned] Four. Four batteries. So that's, um, that's a whole pack, basically. And I think I have some somewhere, but are they— are they the right kind? And are they even, like, are they still good? [trailing off] I should probably just— I should probably just go get new ones. Make sure they're fresh and everything. But that means I have to, uh, I have to go out again, and I literally just got back from— [accepting] You know what? Fine. Fine. I'll just— I'll add it to tomorrow's list. The flashlight can wait one more day, I guess.
313  [screaming] OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! [jumping up and down] Did we both just—did that really happen? [hysterical laughter] We're getting promoted at the same time—this is insane!
314  [shaking voice] My hands won't stop trembling. [quieter] Look at them! [explosive laugh] Remember when Johnson said we'd never make it past junior level? Where's your prophecy now, Johnson?
315  [whispered disbelief] Twenty percent raise. [gradually louder] Twenty. Percent. Raise. [shouting] I'm buying that car, taking that trip, and getting guac at Chipotle without thinking twice! This changes everything!
316  [sobbing with joy] I called my mom before coming here. [voice breaking] She started crying—happy tears—and then I started crying. [sniffling laugh] The whole bus thought I was having a breakdown!
317  [hushed awe] Can you imagine Monday's meeting? [gleefully] Walking in there as executives? [voice cracking] Thompson's face when he realizes we're now his equals—priceless, absolutely priceless!
318  [nervous giggle] What if they made a mistake? [panicked] What if they meant to promote Jennifer and Jennifer? [relieved exhale] No, no, I have the letter right here—it's real!
319  [melodramatic gasp] Our business cards will have "Senior Vice President" on them! [giddy whisper] Embossed lettering! [normal volume] I'm framing mine, laminating it, maybe even getting it tattooed somewhere!
320  [trembling excitement] My student loans are shaking right now. [fierce determination] They know their days are numbered! [victory cry] Sallie Mae, I'm coming for you with executive-level vengeance, baby!
321  [delirious laughter] I'm dizzy—actually physically dizzy from happiness! [steadying breath] Is that normal? [more laughter] Who cares, we're EXECUTIVES now—we probably have better health insurance for dizziness!
322  [emotional whisper] We said we'd do it together. [voice swelling] Through every terrible project, every weekend overtime— [crying and laughing] We actually kept that drunk promise from the holiday party!
323  Sarah, take a deep breath, I'm Emma, your planner. Twelve weeks at the Rosewood venue on 4521 Oak Avenue is actually manageable. Let me pull up your timeline checklist—we can absolutely work through this.
324  No, no, don't postpone! Invitations can go out this week if we expedite with code RUSH24 for printing. I have three florists on standby who can meet you tomorrow at 2 PM, 3:30, or 5 PM.
325  Virtual consultations are perfect actually! The florists can do video calls—let's schedule for 7 PM your time instead? Meanwhile, I'll email you the invitation templates, just need to confirm your guest count is still 175?
326  [professionally] That's fine, the Rosewood ballroom holds up to 225. [in a gentle voice] I'll adjust your catering quote with Premier Foods—their package C-190 is actually $2,000 less than package D-200. Silver lining there!
327  It's 567-8901, I'll call Jennifer directly after this. [warmly] She's probably just swamped with spring bookings, but your contract #JC-1847 is locked in. Everything's actually more on track than you think, Sarah.
328  Good afternoon, this is Allied Loan Services, how can I— I see you're calling about payment posting. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your loan number?
329  [rapidly] I see the account here, let me just— Yes, I show a pending payment from the 15th. [apologetically] Sometimes our system takes up to, um, fourteen business days to fully process.
330  Sir, I understand your frustration, but the processing time is clearly stated in your loan agreement. Page twelve, section four-B. Would you like me to expedite this with my supervisor?
331  [hurriedly] Actually, wait, I'm seeing something here. Did you... did you send the payment to our old processing center? [more gently] We switched banks last month, sent out notices.
332  [speaking quickly] The payment will bounce back to your account within five to seven— I mean, it's safe, don't worry. We can waive the late fee once it's resolved.
333  I wish I could, I really do. But the system won't let me override without the actual funds. Let me create a case number for you, okay?
334  Sir, I— You know what, hold on. I'm flagging this as urgent hardship, that should escalate it within twenty-four hours instead.
335  This is different, I'm putting my employee ID on it. My direct extension is 4-5-5-1, ask for Marcus. I'll personally track this tomorrow morning.
336  [confidently] It will work. Between you and me, I've seen this exact issue before. [quickly] The old bank still forwards payments, just slowly. Should hit by tomorrow afternoon.
337  I've noted everything in your file. When you call tomorrow, even if you don't reach me, any agent will see the urgent flag. We'll get this sorted, I promise.
338  [Sad] I'm so, so sorry—I know how much this meant to you and I just... [Sigh] I completely screwed up the timing, didn't I?
339  [Fast] Okay so basically my alarm didn't go off and then the train was delayed and I—I ran here from the station! [Groan]
340  [Disappointed] This is, um, this is exactly what I promised wouldn't happen. [Slow] I really let you down today, huh?
341  [Whisper] Everyone's already seated and I'm just gonna have to walk in there like—god, this is mortifying. [Tsk]
342  [Angry] I can't believe my GPS took me to the wrong—wait, no, that's not an excuse. [Sigh] I should've left earlier, I know.
343  [Happy] Well, at least I made it before the, uh, before the main part started, right? [Chuckle] That's gotta count for something!
344  [Sarcastic] Oh great, now everyone gets to watch me do the walk of shame to my seat. [Slow] This is just perfect, really.
345  [Sad] My mom's gonna be so disappointed—she reminded me like three times yesterday and I still... [Whisper] I still managed to mess it up.
346  [Shout] I'm here, I'm here! [Fast] Sorry, sorry, the parking was absolutely insane and I had to circle for like twenty minutes!
347  [Disappointed] You know what the worst part is? [Tsk] I actually woke up on time and then just, I dunno, completely lost track of everything.
348  [Fast] Is there, um, is there any way I can sneak in without—actually, never mind, I'll just own it. [Laugh]
349  [Angry] The babysitter canceled last minute and I had to—[Slow] sorry, you don't need to hear my whole sob story right now.
350  [Happy] Hey, fashionably late is still a thing, right? [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] No? Okay, yeah, I deserve that look.
351  [Whisper] I literally had nightmares about being late to this and then it actually—[Groan] it actually happened.
352  [Sad] Can we just, like, pretend I've been here the whole time? [Fast] I'll be so quiet, nobody will even notice, I promise!
353  [Disappointed] Twenty years of friendship and this is how I show up for your big day. [Sigh] I'm honestly the worst.
354  [Shout] Don't start without—oh. [Whisper] Oh, you already started. [Tsk] Of course you did.
355  [Sarcastic] Traffic was totally unpredictable, who could've known there'd be cars on the road? [Sad] God, I'm such an idiot sometimes.
356  [Fast] I've got a really good explanation but, um, but honestly? [Slow] It doesn't matter because I should've been here regardless.
357  [Happy] At least I didn't miss the—wait, I didn't miss the important part yet, did I? [Disappointed] [Groan] Please tell me I didn't.
358  [frustrated] Oh my god, so my mom called me this morning and just— ugh, she just went off on me about how I'm "wasting my potential" because I mentioned I might stay at my current job another year. Like, thanks mom, really needed that with my coffee. [annoyed] She's like "you're too comfortable, you need to push yourself more" and I'm just— I'm twenty-six, like I think I can make my own career decisions? And she kept going on about how my cousin already got promoted twice and I'm just like, okay, cool, good for Rachel I guess. [building frustration] It's just so— it's exhausting, you know? Like I can't just have a conversation with her without it turning into some lecture about what I should be doing differently. I was literally just telling her about my day and somehow it became this whole thing about my life choices. [quieter] [thoughtful] But actually, wait, now that I'm— now that I'm saying it out loud... [pause] she did ask me if I was happy first. Like, before all the advice stuff. And she— oh god, she mentioned that opening at her friend's company again. [realizing] [softer] Oh. She's... she's probably just worried I'm settling, isn't she? Like, in her weird mom way she's trying to— [sigh] she's trying to make sure I don't get stuck somewhere I don't want to be. [guilty] [warm] I should probably call her back and actually listen this time instead of just getting defensive.
359  Oh god, I know—I'm so sorry. I can't believe I—wait, just let me explain what happened, okay? It's not an excuse but I swear there's a reason.
360  Two hours? Oh no no no, that's—[groan] that's even worse than I thought. I thought maybe you'd leave after like thirty minutes. I didn't realize you'd actually wait that long for me.
361  I know. God, I know it was and I—I literally hate myself right now. Like I had it in my calendar, I had three alarms set, I was gonna leave early and everything but then—okay this sounds so stupid now.
362  My ex showed up at my apartment. Like out of nowhere, just—just completely melting down about something and I tried to tell them I had to go but they wouldn't—[nervous laugh] sorry, that's not your problem. I should've just left anyway.
363  No! No, that's not—I didn't choose anyone, I just got stuck and I couldn't—I mean I could've but I didn't know how to just walk away when someone's crying and I kept thinking I'd make it if I could just calm them down real quick, y'know?
364  Please don't—okay, you have every right to be mad. Like genuinely, I would be furious if you missed something that important to me. I'm just—I'm really, really sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything.
365  I know, I know I should've. My phone died and I—that's such a cliché excuse, isn't it? [sigh] But I swear it's true. And by the time I got it charged and saw your messages it was already over and I just... I panicked.
366  I know it did. And you—you matter to me too, so much, which is why I can't believe I screwed this up so badly. Like, I keep replaying it and thinking about all the things I could've done differently.
367  I'm sorry. I'm just—I'm so sorry. I don't know what else to say except that I completely failed you and I—I wanna make it up to you somehow but I know I can't really make up for missing that. Can I... is there anything I can do?
368  Yeah, of course. Take—take all the time you need. I'll be here whenever you're ready to talk or if you need anything at all. And I'm gonna—I mean, if you'll let me, I'd really like to go visit her grave with you sometime. If that's okay.
369  Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? The super competitive one that—oh my god, are you serious right now?
370  I'm—okay, I'm literally about to cry. This is huge! Like, this is the biggest— [Gasp] how are you so calm? I'd be screaming!
371  No no no, don't do that thing where you downplay everything. This is like—do you even know how many people apply for this? You're basically a genius now.
372  Just two years of—are you kidding me? That's life-changing money! And the prestige, oh my god. Your resume is gonna be like, untouchable. Have you told your parents yet?
373  Okay but like—why? They're gonna lose their minds! In the best way! Unless... wait, are you having second thoughts about it?
374  Switzerland. You're going to— [Laugh] of course it's somewhere incredible. I mean, that's far but like... chocolate? Mountains? Come on.
375  So? You'll learn! That's—honestly that's just another skill you're gonna pick up. Plus everyone there speaks English anyway, right? I think? Actually, I dunno, but still!
376  Oh, babe. No. They picked you—out of probably thousands of people, they picked you. That's not luck, y'know? That's them seeing exactly what I see.
377  Someone who's brilliant but won't admit it? Like, you literally solve problems I can't even understand. And you're worried about—what, not being good enough? [Sigh] That's imposter syndrome talking.
378  I'm definitely right. And hey—worst case scenario? You hate it, you come back with an insane story and Swiss chocolate for me. Best case? You're gonna change the world or whatever. No pressure though.
379  Oh god, I—I didn't think it was gonna come out like that! I swear I was just trying to tell a funny story about game night and then—then it kinda spiraled and I couldn't stop myself.
380  I know, I know, that was—that was so stupid of me. I wasn't thinking about how it would sound, y'know? Like in my head it was just this cute story about how you thought Portugal was in South America but then—[nervous laugh]—okay, hearing myself say it now...
381  No no no, that's not—I mean, everyone has those moments, right? I literally thought reindeer were fake until I was like twenty! Remember? I told that story too but nobody was laughing at that the same way and—wait, that's not helping, is it?
382  Right. Of course. I'm just—I'm making this worse. [Sigh] Look, I genuinely didn't mean to embarrass you. I thought I was being funny and inclusive, like "hey, we all make mistakes" but I see now that I just... I threw you under the bus.
383  They don't! They—okay, maybe in that moment it was awkward but honestly? James came up to me after and said everyone has geography blindspots. And Lisa admitted she thought Alaska was an island for years because of how maps show it!
384  You're right, you're—you're totally right. The point is I betrayed your trust and I made you look bad in front of people you have to see every day. That's—god, that's actually really messed up of me. I wasn't thinking about consequences, I was just... running my mouth like always.
385  I gotta—I need to fix this somehow. What if I talk to them? Like individually? I could explain that I exaggerated or—or that I got the story wrong? Would that help? [Groan] I dunno, maybe that makes it worse...
386  Okay, okay, I won't—I won't do anything without asking you first. I promise. No more stories about you, no more trying to be the funny one at your expense. I get it now. I really—I really messed up here.
387  I know. And you—you deserve that, you work so hard and you're literally the smartest person I know. Geography thing aside—sorry, sorry, bad joke. But seriously, you're brilliant and I should've been building you up, not... not whatever that was. I'm really, really sorry.
388  Deal. Absolutely. I've got like—like a million of them anyway. Remember when I tried to shake hands with a mannequin? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I'll just... I'll stick to those. Are we—are we gonna be okay?
389  Wait, what? I—okay, I went, yeah, but I didn't think you'd—it wasn't like a planned thing. Jamie literally texted me last minute and I just... went.
390  Not everyone, come on. It was like—I dunno, maybe ten people? And honestly, I figured Jamie invited you too. I mean, why would I assume [scoff] you weren't invited?
391  Asked? Asked what—"hey, is my best friend invited to your party?" That's—that's weird. I'm not your social secretary, y'know? I just assumed you either couldn't make it or didn't wanna go.
392  Okay okay, fine, maybe I should've—but you're acting like I deliberately excluded you, which is literally not what happened. I was already there when I realized you weren't coming.
393  Because I was—look, I was already kinda drunk, and it felt weird to be like "hey, why aren't you here?" Like, what if you weren't invited? Then I'd just be rubbing it in your face. [frustrated laugh] I can't win here.
394  It's not an excuse, it's—ugh, it's what happened. I'm trying to explain that I didn't mean to hurt you, but apparently that doesn't matter because you've already decided I'm the worst friend ever.
395  You don't have to. You're—the way you're looking at me right now... [sigh] Look look, I get that you're upset. I do. But I'm kinda frustrated too because this wasn't intentional.
396  Um, yeah? It kinda does? There's a huge difference between "I don't care about your feelings" and "I made a dumb assumption." I mean, come on, we've been friends for how long?
397  I—okay, that's fair. That's... yeah. But you could also, I dunno, give me the benefit of the doubt here? Instead of just assuming I'm this terrible person who wanted to leave you out?
398  No, not—not whatever. Look, I'm sorry you got left out, okay? I am. But I'm also not gonna stand here and pretend like I did this horrible thing on purpose when we both know that's not what happened.
399  [muttering] Okay, so I just, um, I just need to put this shirt on and— [sharp intake] oh, wow. Okay. That's, uh, that's a lot of static. Like, a lot a lot. [slightly annoyed] I mean, I used a dryer sheet, I definitely used a— well, I think I used one? Did I use one? I feel like I grabbed one from the, um, from the box, but maybe it was, like, maybe it was old or something. [contemplative] So now what, do I just, uh, do I just wait for it to go away? Is that how this works? [hmm] I could take it off and, like, shake it out or something, but then I'd have to— [resigned] You know what, let me just— let me just stand here for a second. Maybe if I don't move too much the, uh, the static will just... dissipate? Is that the word? [slight laugh] I sound like a weather person. [hopeful] Okay, okay, that felt like less of a shock when I touched my sleeve just now. Progress! Or maybe I'm just, um, maybe I'm just getting used to being a human lightning rod. [accepting] Right, so this is my life now. I'm just gonna be staticky for the next, I don't know, ten minutes? Could be worse, I guess.
400  [quietly] Look at this—Dad's old watch. [voice cracking] Remember how he'd wind it every morning at breakfast? [Shaky exhale] I can still hear that little clicking sound echoing through the kitchen while Mom made coffee.
401  [strained whisper] His cologne bottle's still half full. [Bitter laugh] Thirty years of the same brand—Old Spice Classic. [voice breaking] Why does something so ordinary suddenly feel like it's ripping my chest apart?
402  [with forced brightness] Oh wow, his joke book! [trembling] "101 Dad Jokes for Every Occasion." [Choked laugh] He actually highlighted his favorites—look, this whole page about fishing puns is practically glowing yellow.
403  [suddenly urgent] We should keep the toolbox intact. Every screwdriver, [emphasizing each word] every random screw and washer. [steadier] I know it's junk mostly, but his hands touched all of it—organized it exactly this way.
404  [voice rising] Found the Father's Day cards we made as kids! [laughing through tears] Yours says "World's Okayest Dad" in crayon. [Watery chuckle] Mine just has a stick figure with enormous hands because I couldn't draw.
405  [hollow tone] His reading glasses are on page 847 of this Tom Clancy novel. [pause] [quieter still] He'll never know how it ends. Somehow that feels worse than everything else—that unfinished story just sitting here forever.
406  [fierce whisper] "Reservation at Romano's, yellow roses, [building emotion] chocolate soufflé for dessert." [Breaking down] He drew little stars next to each item like he always did for important things. How are we supposed to tell her?
407  [exhausted] I'm keeping his coffee mug. [defensive edge] The stupid one with the fishing joke that's barely readable anymore. [Wavering] Don't care if it's worthless—I need something for my morning coffee, something that was his.
408  [sudden realization] Oh no, his phone. [panicking] There's probably voicemails we haven't— [more controlled] Should we listen? What if there's something important, or what if hearing his voice just destroys us completely right now?
409  [bitter irony] Found his bucket list from five years ago. [quieter] "Learn Spanish, visit Ireland, [voice dropping] see the boys get married." [Harsh laugh] He crossed off Ireland at least. One out of three.
410  I completely understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account right away—that's 78234-KL9, correct? I see you're on our premium business plan, and yes, there's been an outage reported in the 4500 block area since Tuesday.
411  [sympathetic] I sincerely apologize for those incorrect updates, Mr., uh, Thompson. [more professionally] Our technicians found unexpected damage to the main fiber line near junction box J-447B. [hopeful tone] The good news is they're actually working on it as we speak.
412  Well, I can't make absolute guarantees, but— let me check the latest tech update. Okay, ticket number TK-9982341 shows 85% completion, estimated restoration by 3:30 PM today. That's about two hours from now.
413  I completely get why you're concerned about that meeting. Would you like me to set up a mobile hotspot credit to your account—code MHS-COMP? It's normally $30 but I'll waive it, plus I'm adding three months of free service for this inconvenience.
414  No catch at all, sir—it's compensation code COMP-3M-OUT applied directly. [informatively] The hotspot delivers up to 75 megabits, plenty for your conference. I'm also noting priority status on your repair, which means the senior tech, Rodriguez, badge R-1147, will personally verify your connection.
415  Good afternoon, Willow Creek HOA, this is Janet speaking. How may I assist you today?
416  Oh, Mr. Miller, let me just... pull up your file here. Yes, I see your submission from October 3rd. It appears it's still under architectural review.
417  Sir, I understand your frustration, but [more firmly] the committee only meets once a month. [quickly] Your application missed the October meeting by two days, so it's scheduled for November's agenda.
418  Mr. Miller, these procedures are in place to ensure all modifications meet community standards and property values are protected. However, I can flag your application as urgent for the board's attention.
419  [more reassuringly] It means the board will review it first during the meeting. Additionally, if you can email me your contractor's timeline, [helpfully] I might be able to request an emergency review—though that requires three board members' approval.
420  Between you and me, Mr. Miller, emergency reviews usually go through within 72 hours if the request is reasonable. A simple deck addition shouldn't be controversial.
421  Send it directly to my attention at janet.davis@willowcreekhoa.com. Include photos of the proposed area and [speaking faster] make sure to mention the storage fees you're incurring—the board responds well to financial hardship arguments.
422  [chuckles softly] Well, Mr. Miller, I've been here twelve years and I've learned which battles are worth fighting. [more seriously] Just get me that email and I'll do my best for you.
423  They rarely reject decks unless there's a major code violation. If they request modifications, we can usually resolve those within a week through email correspondence—no waiting for another meeting.
424  No apology necessary, Mr. Miller. [warmly] Trust me, if I had to wait six weeks for a deck approval, I'd be calling here pretty frustrated too.
425  [Nervous] Um, does anyone actually know if that emergency button, like—does it really work or is it just for show? [Laugh]
426  [Angry] This is literally the third time this month I've been—I'm filing a complaint with building management, I swear. [Groan]
427  [Happy] Well, at least we're not alone, right? [Chuckle] I mean, imagine being stuck in here by yourself—that'd be way worse!
428  [Whisper] Do you guys hear that creaking sound or is it just—oh god, please tell me you hear it too. [Fast]
429  [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, my phone's at two percent, because of course it is. [Tsk] This day just keeps getting better.
430  [Slow] So, uh, anyone here actually claustrophobic? [Sad] Because I'm kinda starting to feel it now, honestly.
431  [Disappointed] I had a job interview in—actually, forget it, they're never gonna believe this excuse anyway. [Sigh]
432  [Fast] Okay so basically my wife's gonna think I'm lying about being stuck because last week I said I was stuck in traffic when I wasn't—this is bad. [Groan]
433  [Shout] HELLO? CAN ANYONE OUT THERE HEAR US? [Angry] WE'RE BETWEEN FLOORS THREE AND FOUR!
434  [Chuckle] Y'know, this is actually kinda like that episode of The Office where—wait, did anyone else watch that show?
435  [Sad] My daughter's recital starts in twenty minutes and I promised her I'd—I promised I wouldn't miss another one. [Sigh]
436  [Sarcastic] Sure, let's all just breathe each other's recycled air for the next hour, that sounds super fun. [Disappointed]
437  [Happy] Hey, wanna play twenty questions while we wait? [Fast] I mean, we gotta do something to pass the time, right?
438  [Whisper] I really, really need to use the bathroom—like, this is gonna get embarrassing real quick if we don't get out soon. [Tsk]
439  [Slow] You ever notice how elevator music just... stops when something goes wrong? [Chuckle] Like even the music abandons ship.
440  [Angry] [Fast] I told them—I literally told maintenance last week that this thing was making weird noises but did they listen? No!
441  [Disappointed] I guess my ice cream's gonna be completely melted by the time we—wait, can you suffocate in these things? [Whisper]
442  [Happy] This'll be a great story for dinner parties though—"Remember that time I got trapped with five strangers?" [Laugh]
443  [Sad] [Slow] My anxiety meds are in my car, so this is, um... this is gonna be interesting.
444  [Shout] PRESS THE BUTTON AGAIN! [Sarcastic] Maybe it just needs some aggressive encouragement to start working!
445  [casual] So I took this screenshot earlier of Maya's text about the whole drama with her roommate. You know how she is with like, oversharing about every little conflict? [light laugh] I just wanted to show you how ridiculous it was getting. [conversational] I'm scrolling through my camera roll now trying to find it, and oh my god, I have like two hundred screenshots in here. When did I become this person? Half of them are just random tweets I'll never look at again. [slightly amused] But yeah, Maya was going on about how her roommate left dishes in the sink for— wait, hold on. [pause] Wait, where did the screenshot go? I swear I just took it like an hour ago. [confused] [a bit concerned] That's weird, it's not here. Unless... [nervous laugh] unless I... no, no way. I wouldn't have sent it directly to— let me just check my messages real quick. [dawning horror] Oh no. Oh no no no. I sent it TO Maya. I sent Maya a screenshot of her own dramatic text. [groan] She's gonna see that I was making fun of her to— [panic building] My phone's buzzing. She's calling. She's actually calling me right now! [whimpering] What do I even say? "Hey Maya, sorry I screenshotted your personal drama to mock you"? [full panic] [mortified] I can't answer this. I literally cannot face this conversation. I'm the worst friend alive!
446  I—okay, I did say that, but it's not—it's not that simple, alright? I mean, I do like it! I just... maybe not as much as I said I did?
447  No no no, not lied, I just—I exaggerated? A little? You were so excited and I didn't wanna—I couldn't just tell you it wasn't my thing, y'know? [nervous laugh] That would've been cruel.
448  That's—that's not what I meant to do. I swear, I was trying to be supportive! Like, you worked so hard on it and I could see how proud you were and I just... I dunno, I got caught up in the moment.
449  I know, I know you did. And I should've—god, I should've just been straight with you. But honestly? I was scared, okay? You're kinda intimidating when it comes to your art and I didn't—[sigh] I didn't wanna disappoint you.
450  Oh. Oh shit. I—that was... okay, I can explain that. I was venting, and I didn't mean—wait wait, that sounds bad. Um. I wasn't trying to talk behind your back or anything, Marcus just asked and I was being stupid.
451  I didn't—I mean, technically I said "amateurish" which is—no, sorry, that's not better. Christ. Look, I'm an idiot, alright? A complete idiot who doesn't know anything about art anyway so why does my opinion even matter?
452  I know. [quieter] I know it did. And that's—that's why I feel so terrible right now. Like, genuinely sick to my stomach. You trusted me to be honest and I just... I blew it. I completely blew it.
453  Oh my god. Oh my god, I didn't—you didn't tell me you were gonna do that! I mean, not that it's your fault, obviously it's not, but I—if I'd known you were gonna... shit. I'm so sorry. Like, so incredibly sorry.
454  Please don't—please don't hate me? I know I messed up, I really really do, but I wanna make this right. Whatever you need me to do, I'll do it. You want me to call those galleries? Tell them I'm an idiot who knows nothing?
455  Yes. Absolutely. I promise—and I mean actually promise this time—I will never, ever do that again. Even if it's hard, even if I think it might hurt your feelings... you deserve the truth. [pause] Your friendship means everything to me, y'know? I just—I really hope I haven't ruined it.
456  Oh. Um, okay—look, before you freak out, it wasn't even a party. It was literally just like five people who happened to be at Jake's place, and it just kinda...happened.
457  Yeah, it did actually. We were gonna watch the game and then—I dunno, people started showing up and [sigh] I know how it looks, but it wasn't some planned thing where I deliberately didn't invite you.
458  No, that's—that's not how it went down. Jake texted me last minute, like an hour before, and I was already in the neighborhood. I mean, was I supposed to be like "hold on, let me invite everyone I know"?
459  Okay okay, maybe I could've, but honestly? You've been super busy lately and you literally told me last week you were burnt out on social stuff. So I figured—wrongly, apparently—that you wouldn't even wanna come.
460  Fine, you're right, it's not. But you're acting like I'm this terrible friend when I was actually trying to respect what you said. [frustrated laugh] I can't win here.
461  Sam was Jake's roommate's plus one! I didn't even know he was gonna be there until I showed up. Look look, I get that you're hurt, and maybe I should've—I probably should've texted you. But this feels kinda unfair.
462  Yeah, unfair. Because you're making it sound like we all got together and decided to exclude you, which is not what happened. At all. And honestly? You've bailed on the last three things we invited you to.
463  How? How is that different? You don't show up when we invite you, but then get mad when—okay, y'know what, that came out wrong. [groan] I'm not trying to attack you here.
464  Well I'm—I'm frustrated too, okay? Because I feel like no matter what I do lately, you're disappointed in me. And yeah, maybe I messed up this time, but you're not exactly making it easy to apologize.
465  You're right. I haven't. Because honestly? Part of me doesn't think I should have to. But I am sorry you're hurt. I am. I just—I wish you could see that it wasn't about you.
466  Oh! Oh no, wait—which ones? I posted like a bunch from last night and I thought they were all really cute! Did I—did I miss something?
467  That's not—okay, you don't look like that at all! I mean, maybe the lighting was a little weird but I honestly thought you looked great! I wouldn't have posted them if I didn't think—
468  Yeah, yeah of course, I'm literally doing it right now. [nervous laugh] I'm so sorry, I should've asked you first. I just got excited because we haven't hung out in forever and I wanted to—but that's not an excuse.
469  I know, I know, I'm the worst. Like genuinely, I feel terrible. I was just—I dunno, I was going through them really quick this morning and I thought they were fine but clearly I wasn't paying attention and that's on me.
470  That's not—I mean, that wasn't intentional! I swear I wasn't trying to make myself look better than you or anything like that. You know I would never—[groan] okay, I can see how it looks though.
471  No no no, please don't be mad. I'm deleting them right now, see? Gone. And I'll—I'll post that really good one of you from dinner last week instead, the one where you're laughing? You look amazing in that one.
472  You're right, you're totally right. The point is I should've checked with you first. I just—I get so carried away with posting stuff immediately and I don't think about—god, I'm such an idiot sometimes.
473  I know. I should've texted you or—or shown them to you before I posted anything. That's like, basic friend etiquette and I completely failed. I'm really, really sorry. [sigh] I honestly didn't mean to make you feel bad.
474  Oh my god, no. No no no, that's—that's awful. I'm so sorry. Listen, I'll post something right now about how my phone camera was being weird or—wait, that sounds stupid. Um, what if I just post a bunch of really good ones of you?
475  I will. I promise I will, every single time. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna go through and delete any other ones where you don't look perfect, okay? Like, I mean it. I really am sorry. You know I love you, right?
476  [muttering to self] Okay, so I've got, um, I've got the dentist at three, and then— wait. Wait wait wait. [pause] Didn't I tell Sarah I'd meet her at, uh, at three thirty? For coffee? [slightly panicked] Oh no. Oh no no no, that's— that's not gonna work. The dentist is gonna be, like, at least an hour, right? I mean, it's just a cleaning, but they always— they always run late, and then there's the, um, the fluoride thing, and— [thinking out loud] Okay, so if I— if I text Sarah now, maybe we can, uh, maybe we can push it to four? Four thirty? But didn't she say she had that, um, that thing with her mom later? [groan] Why do I do this to myself? [resigned] I should probably just— I should just call the dentist and see if they can, uh, if they can move me earlier. Or later. I don't know. [sigh] This is what I get for, um, for scheduling things on my phone at like midnight when I can't think straight. [trailing off] Unless Sarah's free tomorrow instead... but then that messes up my whole—
477  [whispering] I can't believe it. [Shaky exhale] All those boys we couldn't save, Thomas with his letters from home still unopened. [louder, breaking] What do we tell their mothers now? That it ended too late?
478  [angrily] Hours! [Choking sob] We lost twelve men this morning alone—for what? [in a whisper] They knew it was coming at eleven o'clock. The generals knew and they still sent them over the top.
479  [hollowly] Home. [nervous laugh] I don't even remember what my mother's kitchen smells like anymore. [growing desperate] All I know is carbolic acid, gangrene, and that sweet smell when the gas victims come in.
480  [gently] Yes, we did save some. [voice strengthening] Maybe a thousand men between us who'll see their families again. [Shuddering sigh] But Mary, I keep seeing the faces of all the others haunting these tent walls.
481  [firmly] They deserve to celebrate—God knows they've sacrificed enough. [voice dropping] But you're right, it feels strange. [Soft sob] My brother won't be coming back to join them. Passchendaele took him last year, remember?
482  [laughing through tears] Acid, yes—that's exactly it. [more controlled] The newspapers will call us heroes, angels of mercy. [Bitter chuckle] But angels shouldn't know how to tourniquets so fast, or recognize death's approach by smell alone.
483  [thoughtfully] Perhaps we're not meant to make sense of it. [voice breaking] Maybe we just carry it with us forever, like shrapnel too deep to remove. [more steadily] At least we'll carry it together—promise me that?
484  [gratefully] The nightmares—God, they'll be awful won't they? [rapidly] Every time I close my eyes I see that boy from Birmingham. [Whimper] Eighteen years old, crying for his mother while his intestines spilled through my fingers.
485  [quietly] You're right, I know you're right. [growing emotional] But Mary, what if I forget their faces? [Panicked breath] What if time makes them fade and all this suffering becomes meaningless, just another chapter in history books?
486  [peacefully] Yes. [Deep exhale] We'll be their living memorial, won't we? [with determination] Every breath we take from now on is one they should have had. [trembling] So we'd better make them count, hadn't we, Mary?
487  I understand your concern, let me pull up Emma's file right away. Account 4K7892B, yes, I see she's been working with Mr. Davidson. Can you tell me which specific areas you feel aren't improving?
488  [concerned] Those scores are certainly not what we'd expect to see. I'm looking at Mr. Davidson's progress reports here, and he notes that Emma has been, um... arriving late to about half the sessions?
489  Of course, punctuality is just one factor we consider. Let me check something else—I see the sessions are scheduled for 4:30 PM at 1845 Maple Street. Has Emma been completing the assigned homework between sessions?
490  Our satisfaction guarantee does cover situations like this, absolutely. I can offer you three options: switch to a different tutor, maybe Ms. Chen who has a 94% success rate, or we could try a different approach with two sessions weekly?
491  I completely understand the investment you've made. Actually, if we move to twice weekly, I can apply discount code EDU2024X for 20% off. Ms. Chen also offers a free assessment session to identify exactly where the gaps are.
492  [confidently] That means 94% of her students improve by at least one letter grade within eight sessions. [enthusiastically] She specializes in calculus actually, and—between you and me, she's much better than Mr. Davidson with struggling students.
493  [efficiently] Absolutely, I'm creating case number TUT-20241108-3921 right now. Ms. Chen has availability Tuesday and Thursday at 5:00 PM, same location. Should I schedule Emma's free assessment for this Tuesday, November 12th?
494  That's completely fair, and we encourage parent involvement actually. I'm sending confirmation to your email at mrodriguez74@gmail. I'll also include Ms. Chen's direct extension, 4412, so you can communicate any concerns immediately.
495  [empathetically] You're not being difficult at all—you're being a concerned parent. I have teenagers myself, I completely understand. [confidently] Let's give Ms. Chen these eight sessions, and if there's no improvement, we'll provide a full refund for those sessions.
496  Perfect, it's all documented in case TUT-20241108-3921. [professionally] You'll receive the confirmation email within five minutes, and Ms. Chen will call you personally before Tuesday. [warmly] Thank you for giving us another chance—Emma's success is our priority too.
497  Good afternoon, this is Sarah from Henderson Accounting. I see you've contacted us about missing documents for your tax filing. Let me pull up your account right away to help you.
498  I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [quickly] Looking at your file now... okay, I see here that we sent them on the 15th. [confused] Did you check your email spam folder by any chance?
499  Alright, let me verify the email we have on file. Is it mchen at globaltech dot com? Wait, actually I'm seeing here... oh, there might be an issue with our server that day.
500  [reassuringly] Absolutely, I can do that right now. I'm... I'm actually going to send them two ways—email and our secure portal. You'll have them within five minutes, I guarantee it.
501  No, no, that won't be necessary at all. I'm personally handling this—sending now... and... done! Check your email right now, and I'll stay on the line to confirm you receive it.
502  [Angry] You know what, I'm just—I'm done explaining myself to people who've already decided what I'm capable of. [Groan]
503  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just, um, pretend to be shocked when I actually pull this off, right? [Tsk]
504  [Happy] Wait till they see what I've been working on—honestly, their faces are gonna be priceless! [Laugh]
505  [Disappointed] I thought you'd at least, like, give me a chance before writing me off completely. [Sigh]
506  [Fast] Okay so basically everyone thinks I can't do it but they don't know I've already—never mind, they'll see. [Chuckle]
507  [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda like when they underestimate me—makes winning so much sweeter, y'know?
508  [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, um, if I'm really as capable as I think or if they're right. [Slow] [Sigh]
509  [Shout] I got the promotion! [Happy] All those people who said I wasn't ready can just—yeah! [Laugh]
510  [Angry] [Fast] No no no, you don't get to act surprised now when I told you I could handle this months ago!
511  [Sarcastic] I mean, why would anyone think the youngest person here might actually have, oh I dunno, fresh ideas? [Tsk] [Disappointed]
512  [Slow] The thing is—look, I've been doing this quietly, successfully, for like three years now without anyone noticing.
513  [Happy] You should've seen his face when I started speaking fluent Mandarin—he literally thought I was just the intern! [Laugh] [Fast]
514  [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna quit and go somewhere that'll, you know, actually see what I bring to the table.
515  [Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I thought that after everything I've accomplished, they'd finally start to, um, take me seriously.
516  [Angry] [Shout] Five patents! I have five patents and they still treat me like I'm some kind of—ugh!
517  [Chuckle] Funny how they're all scrambling to work with me now that I've, uh, basically saved the company. [Sarcastic]
518  [Fast] [Happy] Did you hear what Jennifer said about my presentation—wait, she actually called it brilliant, can you believe that?
519  [Sad] My own family doesn't even think I can—I mean, they literally laughed when I told them my plans. [Groan]
520  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's all pretend that the "surprising success" wasn't something I'd been telling everyone would happen for months.
521  [Whisper] Honestly? Part of me wants to fail just to, like, prove them right so they'll leave me alone. [Sigh] [Disappointed]
522  [matter-of-fact] So I was, um, I was doing dishes this morning and the, uh, the kitchen sink was draining really slow. Like, you know, just, um, just sitting there with all the soapy water not going anywhere. I figured it was, uh, probably just some food bits or whatever. [casual] So I'm like, okay, I should probably, um, I should probably take a look at this thing. I mean, it's been getting worse for, like, a few days now, so, um, so I figured I'd just— I'd just check it out real quick. [slightly concerned] I pull out my phone flashlight and I'm, uh, I'm looking down into the drain, and at first it just looks like, um, like normal drain stuff, you know? But then I— then I see this, uh, this dark clump just sitting there. [realization dawning] And I'm like, wait, what is— what is that exactly? So I lean in closer and— [sharp exhale] oh my god. Oh no. It's hair. It's like, um, it's like a whole— a whole nest of hair just, uh, just clogged up in there. [disgusted] And it's not just, um, it's not just a few strands, it's like— [gag] ugh, it's like a whole, uh, a whole hairball situation. Like, matted and gross and probably been there for— [shudder] I can't even think about it. [building revulsion] The smell hit me and I just— [gag] I literally had to, um, had to back away from the sink. It's so— it's so disgusting I can't even— how did I let it get that bad? [peak disgust] I'm never— I'm never looking in a drain again without, um, without expecting the worst. [dry heave] God, I can still smell it. It's like, uh, it's like wet dog mixed with— [gag] no, I can't. I literally cannot deal with this right now.
523  Wait wait wait—THE app? The one you've been like, basically living and breathing for the past what, eight months? Oh my god, how are you feeling right now?
524  Decent? Are you—okay you're being so casual about this but like, this is huge! I mean, you literally built this thing from nothing. [Laugh] Give me numbers, what's decent?
525  Twenty thou—holy shit. That's not decent, that's like... that's incredible! Wait, is that good? I feel like that's really good, right?
526  Above projections, he says. You're just gonna—okay, you're gonna sit there and act like you didn't just absolutely crush it? This is so typical of you, honestly.
527  No no no, we're not—we're not doing the doom spiral thing today. Can you just like, I dunno, let yourself be happy for five seconds? [Sigh] You've earned this.
528  Yeah, I bet you're—actually, when's the last time you actually slept? Like really slept, not that weird couch nap thing you do.
529  Okay that's—Jesus, that's not okay. You're gonna crash so hard. But also like, I get it? The adrenaline must be absolutely insane right now.
530  See? See, there it is! [Laugh] You're trying so hard not to smile right now but I can hear it. That's gotta feel amazing, having strangers actually use your thing.
531  Weird how? Like scary-weird or like—wait, are you having one of those moments where it doesn't feel real? Because that's totally normal, y'know?
532  Done for now, maybe. But knowing you? You're probably already thinking about version two, aren't you? God, you're such a—you're impossible, but I'm so fucking proud of you.
533  Oh. Um, yeah, I meant to tell you about that—I know how it looks, but it's not like I just stole it from you. We worked on that together, remember?
534  Because you weren't—look, you weren't even gonna be there! The opportunity came up and I had to make a call. Was I supposed to just let it pass?
535  I did! I literally said "we" like five times, but okay, maybe I should've been more [sigh] explicit about it. But honestly, you're acting like I planned this whole thing behind your back.
536  That's—no. No, I didn't. Come on, we've been bouncing ideas off each other for months. I thought that's what we do, y'know? Share stuff, build on it together.
537  I'm not taking credit for—okay okay, fine. Maybe I got carried away in the moment. But you gotta understand, they put me on the spot and I just... ran with it.
538  Because we developed them tog—[frustrated laugh] you know what? Yeah. Some of those were yours. But some were mine too, and you're conveniently forgetting that part.
539  Was it though? 'Cause I remember us sitting at that coffee shop, both of us throwing out ideas, and it kinda just... emerged. I mean, I'm not saying you didn't contribute, but—
540  No, wait—I'm trying to explain here. You're mad, I get it, but you're also not being fair about what actually happened. This was collaborative until suddenly it's not?
541  I went solo because I had to! And honestly? [scoff] I'm getting pretty frustrated that you can't see that. Like, I'm sorry I didn't handle it perfectly, but I'm not gonna apologize for taking an opportunity.
542  Don't—don't do that. Look look, I know I messed up the communication part, okay? I should've told you first. But acting like I'm some kinda thief when we've literally always shared ideas... that hurts too, y'know?
543  That's not—okay, that's not even true. I told like, two people, and honestly? I wasn't ready to tell anyone, but they kinda figured it out on their own.
544  Don't do that. Don't just—look, I know you're pissed, but you're acting like I deliberately excluded you when that's not what happened. I wasn't ready to talk about it with you specifically because I knew you'd—[sigh] I knew you'd make it into this whole thing.
545  No, I mean—ugh, that's not what I meant and you know it. I mean you'd wanna fix everything immediately and sometimes I just need to, like, sit with stuff before I'm ready for that kind of help, y'know?
546  You literally always push. Always. And usually that's—fine, whatever, but this time I needed space and I'm not gonna apologize for taking it.
547  It wasn't about you! God, why does everything have to be—[frustrated laugh] I was dealing with my own shit, okay? And yeah, maybe I should've said something sooner, but I wasn't ready. I wasn't.
548  They found out by accident! Marcus saw me at the clinic and Jen—she basically cornered me when I was crying in my car. It's not like I planned some secret meeting without you.
549  And said what? "Hey, so I've been going through this massive thing but please don't ask questions or try to help"? Come on. You would've been at my door with like, soup and self-help books within the hour.
550  Yeah, well, sometimes—sometimes I don't want that. Sometimes I need to figure things out without someone hovering, and I'm allowed to do that. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings but I'm not sorry for needing boundaries.
551  What else would you—okay okay, fine. You wanna be mad? Be mad. But I was drowning, alright? [quieter] And I knew if I told you, you'd try to save me before I even figured out if I wanted to be saved.
552  I know. I know you did. And maybe I should've—I dunno, handled it better. But I was barely handling it at all, so... yeah. That's all I got.
553  I didn't—okay, yeah, I called them, but only because you were having that panic attack last week and I thought—I was trying to help. You were literally crying about how you weren't ready.
554  Look look, I get that you're mad, but you were—you couldn't even breathe when you talked about it. I was worried about you. [Sigh] Maybe I should've asked first, but honestly, you weren't exactly in a state to make decisions.
555  That's not—come on, that's not what I meant and you know it. I've watched you push yourself into these situations that make you miserable, and I just... I dunno, I thought I was being a good friend.
556  By caring enough to [frustrated laugh] actually do something when you're struggling instead of just watching you fall apart. But fine, apparently that makes me the bad guy here.
557  Because you needed—okay okay, I see how that looks now, but you kept saying you wanted to go and then backing out, and your mom has good insurance, so I thought... I mean, was it really that terrible that she knows?
558  Well I didn't—I didn't know it was gonna be this huge thing. You talk about wanting help all the time, and then you never actually... whatever. I'm sorry I tried to make it easier for you.
559  I'm not mad, I'm just—I'm frustrated because you're acting like everything I did was some kind of... control thing, when really I was just trying to—y'know what, forget it.
560  Trying to help someone who won't help themselves. There, I said it. And maybe that's—maybe that's not my job or whatever, but watching you stuck in the same patterns over and over is honestly exhausting sometimes.
561  That's not... [Groan] See, this is what you do. I'm not saying I wanna stop being your friend, I'm saying that maybe—just maybe—you could try to see that I wasn't coming from a bad place here.
562  No, but they should count for something, right? Like, I messed up, fine, but you're treating me like I'm some kind of—I dunno, like I'm your enemy instead of someone who actually gives a shit about you.
563  [muttering] Okay so, um, do I need the extended warranty? I mean, it's— it's just a toaster, right? But, uh, but they're really pushing it here, like, "protect your investment" and all that. Investment? It's forty bucks. [slightly skeptical] Three years for, um, for twelve dollars extra. That's not— that's not terrible, I guess? But like, what even breaks on a toaster? The, uh, the heating things? The cord? [hmm] I've never actually had a toaster break on me. [thinking out loud] But then again, Murphy's Law, right? The second I don't get the warranty, it's gonna— it's gonna just die. Like, immediately. Day after the regular warranty runs out, boom, dead toaster. [sigh] That would be so typical. [faster, slightly anxious] Wait, but what if I move? Am I gonna— am I gonna keep the receipt? Will I even remember I have a warranty? I can barely remember to, um, to pay my phone bill half the time. [resigned, trailing off] You know what, twelve bucks. It's twelve bucks. If it makes them stop asking me about it... [exhale] Fine. Sure. Let's protect the investment.
564  [mortified whisper] Jeremy, please keep your voice down. [urgently] Everyone's staring at us, and she's standing right there by the kitchen. [Nervous laugh] Can't you just leave fifteen percent like a normal person for once in your life?
565  [exasperated] She's a single mom working doubles! [pleading tone] I talked to her last week when you were in the bathroom. [Heavy sigh] Your "economics lesson" means her kid might not get new school shoes this month.
566  [through gritted teeth] Five dollars? [increasingly agitated] You spent forty dollars on that bottle of wine alone! [Bitter laugh] But God forbid you leave an extra three bucks for someone who served us for ninety minutes straight.
567  [quietly seething] You know what? [building volume] I'm done being embarrassed every single time we go out. [Shaky breath] This is the last dinner I'm having with you until you learn basic human decency and social awareness.
568  [firmly] I'm going back inside. [determined] I'm leaving her a proper tip and apologizing for your behavior. [Disgusted sigh] And yes, I'm ending our restaurant outings because I can't stand watching you humiliate hardworking people anymore.
569  [coldly] It's not virtue signaling, Jeremy. [measured tone] It's called not being a complete asshole to service workers. [Tired exhale] You make six figures but act like leaving twenty percent will bankrupt you somehow.
570  [incredulous] Sob story? [voice cracking] She's a human being trying to make rent! [Frustrated groan] You spent two hundred dollars on those concert tickets last week but calculate tips down to the penny like Scrooge.
571  [sarcastically sweet] Oh, I understand perfectly. [building anger] You value your entertainment over people's livelihoods. [Dry laugh] That waitress will definitely remember you too—as the cheap jerk from table twelve who stiffed her.
572  [wearily] But we're not in other countries, are we? [firmly] We're here, where servers make two dollars an hour. [Deep breath] I'm done arguing—enjoy eating alone from now on, because I won't be joining.
573  [walking away] Fiscal responsibility? [disgusted whisper] You're just cheap, Jeremy. [Hollow laugh] And lonely—because nobody wants to be seen in public with someone who treats people like they're beneath them. Goodbye.
574  Wait, what? I—no no no, I wasn't laughing AT you, I swear. It was just—the timing was so weird and I didn't know what else to—
575  Oh god. Oh god, I know. I'm—I'm literally the worst person alive right now. It wasn't—I wasn't laughing at that, I promise you. My brain just like... short-circuited? [nervous laugh] Sorry, that's not funny either.
576  No, please—just let me explain. You know how I get when I'm uncomfortable, right? Like, I do that stupid nervous laugh thing when I don't know how to—when things get too heavy and I just... I panicked.
577  That's not—okay, yes, but not like that. Not like I didn't wanna hear it or anything. I just didn't know what to say and my body just—it just reacted before my brain could catch up, y'know? I'm so, so sorry.
578  I know. I know and I completely failed you and I—[sigh] honestly, I've been replaying it in my head all night. Like, the look on your face when I... god, I'm such an idiot.
579  I really wanna fix this. I mean, I dunno if I even can, but like—you're one of my best friends and I just... I reacted wrong. Sometimes I laugh when I'm supposed to cry, it's this weird thing I've always—that's not an excuse though.
580  No, it's really not. And I should've—I should've just shut up and hugged you or something. Literally anything would've been better than what I did. Your dad's gonna be okay though, right? I mean—sorry, is it okay to ask that?
581  Yeah... yeah, of course it is. [quieter] I'm really, really sorry about your dad. And about being the world's worst friend when you needed me.
582  The absolute worst timing. But I'm—I'm here now, okay? Like, actually here. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. I promise I won't laugh or make it weird or—I'll just listen. I can do that.
583  Yeah, tomorrow. Definitely. And um... thank you. For like, not completely writing me off. I know I don't deserve—just, thank you. And I really am sorry.
584  [casual] So I'm, um, I'm making lunch and I hear this, uh, this text tone go off? And I'm like, oh, that's— that's weird, I thought I put my phone on silent, you know? But like, whatever, I'll— I'll check it in a second. [conversational] So I finish, um, making my sandwich and I go grab my phone from the, uh, the counter. And I'm expecting like, you know, maybe one text? Like from my mom or, um, or whatever. [slight concern] But I look at the screen and it's like— oh. Oh no. There's, um, there's like fifteen messages from Jake. And they're all— they're all from like, uh, the last two hours? Which is, um, which is not normal for him, right? [growing worry] So I start scrolling and it's like, "Hey, did you see my message?" and then, um, "Hello?" and then "Are you ignoring me?" And I'm like, uh, what message? What is he— what is he talking about? [panic building] And then I keep scrolling and there's more— there's like, "This is really important" and "I can't believe you're not responding" and— [exhales] oh my god, there's like twenty-five messages now. They're still— they're still coming in! [frantic] I don't even know what the, uh, what the original thing was! It's just— it's just an avalanche of, um, of angry texts and I— [groan] I can't— how do I even respond to this? Like where do I— where do I even start?
585  [frustrated] Oh my God, you should have seen this morning. So you know how Sarah's been planning this wedding for like two years? Every detail perfect, outdoor ceremony, the whole thing. And I wake up and it's just— [sigh] it's pouring. Like absolutely dumping rain. [stressed] And Sarah is, she's just losing it, right? Like completely falling apart. The tent's not gonna fit everyone, half the decorations are gonna be ruined, and I'm trying to be supportive but honestly I'm thinking this is gonna be a disaster. Like a total, soggy disaster. [annoyed] The flowers are all droopy, people are showing up with umbrellas and wet shoes, and I'm just— I'm standing there in my heels getting soaked thinking this poor girl, you know? This is supposed to be her perfect day and it's just... [quieter] [realizing] But then— okay wait, so they're doing the ceremony and I actually look around for the first time instead of just complaining in my head about my wet dress, and... [amazed] [warm] It was like— it was magical. The rain on the tent sounded like this soft drumming, and all the string lights were reflecting in the puddles, and everyone looked so cozy and intimate under the tent. Like we were all sharing this beautiful secret moment. [soft] [emotional] Sarah looked radiant. Absolutely radiant. Sometimes the imperfect moments are the most perfect ones, you know?
586  [excited] Oh my god, I am so ready for today! I've been planning this beach trip all week, I got the cooler packed, I found my good sunglasses, I even— I even bought that new sunscreen, the fancy one that doesn't make you look like a ghost. [deflated] But then I checked the weather this morning and it's like... [groan] it's supposed to rain. Like actual rain, not just cloudy or whatever. I was so— ugh, I was so looking forward to this, you know? I need this beach day, I need the sun and the waves and just like... not thinking about work for five seconds. [frustrated] And I already told everyone I was going, posted about it yesterday, got my hopes all— I don't know why I even checked the stupid weather app, sometimes it's better to just be surprised, right? [hopeful] [realizing] Wait, hold on though. Let me... let me look at this again because— okay, so it says rain in the morning but then... oh wait. Oh! It clears up by noon! Like completely clears up, sunny the rest of the day. [excited again] [relieved] Okay so we can still do this! We just go later, like leave at eleven-thirty instead of nine. Actually that's— that's probably better anyway, gives me time to actually wake up properly. [chuckle] God, I was about to have a full meltdown over nothing.
587  [exhausted] Ugh, God, my back is absolutely killing me today. I don't know what I did but it's like— it's like right between my shoulder blades and it's just, it's throbbing constantly. I can barely sit up straight without wanting to just [groan] you know? [irritated] And of course it had to happen today when I have like three meetings back to back. I'm sitting there trying to look professional and I'm just like internally screaming because every time I move it's like— ow, ow, ow. [hopeful] Wait, let me just— let me try stretching it out real quick while we're talking. Maybe if I just roll my shoulders back and— oh, oh wait, I think I feel something... [concentrating] Okay, if I just reach my arms up and twist a little to the left— oh my God, oh my— [sharp intake] it's gonna crack, I can feel it building up... [relieved] [amazed] Holy— [loud crack sound] Ohhhhh! Oh wow, okay, that was— that was like the most satisfying crack of my entire life. It's like completely gone now, the pain just like melted away. [laughing] [lighter] I was literally about to ask you for the name of your massage therapist and now I'm just— [chuckle] I'm cured! Sometimes your body just knows exactly what it needs, you know?
588  [casual] [light laugh] So you know how sometimes your stomach makes those weird noises? Like, I'm sitting in that dead silent meeting this morning and my stomach just goes *grrrrowwwwl* — super loud, right in the middle of Johnson's presentation. [chuckling] I'm trying not to laugh because, you know, it's like my body's just announcing to everyone that I skipped breakfast. [conversational] But then like an hour later, I'm at my desk and it happens again. Same exact sound, same spot — right here under my ribs. And I'm thinking, okay, that's weird, it's not really a hungry sound, you know? [slightly concerned] So now I'm actually paying attention to it, and it keeps happening. Like every twenty minutes or so. [pause] And it's not just hunger, it's this weird... gurgling? But not normal stomach gurgling. [more worried] I started googling it — I know, I know, never google symptoms — but like, what if it's something with my gallbladder? Or my liver? [nervous laugh] My uncle had liver problems and— [anxious] [talking faster] Oh god, and now that I'm thinking about it, I've been kind of tired lately. And isn't that a symptom of like... everything bad? [sharp exhale] What if I've been ignoring something serious this whole time? [spiraling] [breathless] I can't stop listening for it now. Every little sound my body makes — is that normal? Was it always this loud? [whimper] I think I need to call my doctor. Like, today. What if it's—
589  [excited] Oh my god, I have to tell you about this apartment! I finally signed the lease today and it's— it's perfect, like everything I wanted. The kitchen has this huge island and there's so much light, and the bedroom actually fits a queen bed without looking like a sardine can. [excited] [rushed] And the rent is like way better than I expected for that area, which I was like, okay this is too good to be true, but the landlord seems legit and— yeah, I'm just so relieved to finally have a place, you know? [uncertainty creeping in] I mean, the neighborhood is... I don't know, I drove through it at like two in the afternoon on a Tuesday, so it's probably not, um... it's probably not representative of what it's actually like to live there, right? [worried] Like what if it gets sketchy at night? What if the neighbors are awful and there's like loud music until three AM or— God, what if I made a huge mistake? I didn't even meet any of the other tenants. [surprised] [brightening] Oh wait, actually— there's someone at my door right now, hold on... [warm] [relieved] Okay so that was my upstairs neighbor! She brought me cookies and a little plant as a welcome gift. She seems so sweet, and she was telling me about this little community garden behind the building that I totally missed when I— [chuckle] okay yeah, I think I'm gonna like it here.
590  [casual] [light] So you know that lemon cake recipe I was telling you about? The one from my mom's cookbook? Well, I didn't have any lemons, but I had limes, so I figured— you know, citrus is citrus, right? [chuckle] How different could it be? [conversational] I mean, lime cake sounds fancy anyway. Like something you'd get at a trendy bakery for twelve dollars a slice. And the batter looked pretty good, maybe a little— well, maybe a little greener than usual, but that's just the lime, obviously. [still light] [slightly proud] So it's cooling on the counter right now, and honestly? It smells amazing. [sniff] Like, really tropical and— oh, you know what, let me just try a little piece of this corner here... [faltering] Hm. That's... that's very... [pause] Wait, let me try another bite. Maybe I just got a weird spot or— [realization dawning] Oh. Oh no. [groan] This is— this tastes like I baked a margarita. But like, a bad margarita. A really, really bitter margarita that someone left soap in. [dismay building] I used the whole bag of limes! Eight limes! Do you know how much limes cost? [frustrated exhale] And I was gonna bring this to Sarah's party tomorrow! [spiraling] [defeated] I can't bake! I literally cannot bake! My mom makes this recipe blindfolded and I turned it into inedible citrus cement! [whimper] What am I supposed to bring now? Store-bought cookies like a failure?
591  [frustrated] Ugh, so I'm looking at my history test from yesterday and I'm like— I'm so annoyed because I got this one question wrong about the Treaty of Versailles, and I know I studied that like crazy. Like I literally made flashcards for that whole unit. [irritated] And it's asking about the year it was signed, and I put 1919, which is right, but apparently Professor Chen marked it wrong? Like what the hell, you know? That's such an easy point to lose over nothing. [getting worked up] I was gonna go to his office hours and be like, look, this is clearly correct, I don't know what— [sigh] I hate having to argue about grades, it's so awkward, but like I earned those points, you know? [confused] [trailing off] Wait, let me just... let me look at this again because I want to make sure I'm reading it right before I go marching into his office and... [surprised] Oh. Oh wait, that's— that's not an X. That's like a really badly drawn checkmark. [half laugh] Oh my god, I think he actually marked it correct? [sheepish] [relieved] Okay yeah, no, looking at it now that's definitely— that's definitely a check. Just a really, really terrible handwriting situation. [small laugh] Crisis averted, I guess. God, I was about to be so embarrassing.
592  [casual] So I'm walking back from lunch today and I hear these voices coming from the break room, right? And they're like, clearly in the middle of some heated discussion. You know how it is when you accidentally walk into drama. [conversational] [light laugh] I wasn't trying to eavesdrop or anything, but they were being pretty loud about it. Something about someone being "unprofessional" and "not meeting expectations." Classic office gossip stuff. [a bit more interested] But then I hear Sarah's voice, and I'm like, oh, that's my boss. And she's going back and forth with someone from HR. And I'm thinking, wow, someone's really in trouble, you know? [realization dawning] Wait... [pause] they just said my name. Did they just— they're talking about my presentation from yesterday. Oh god, they're talking about me. [growing anxiety] "Unprofessional"? What does that even mean? I wore a blazer! I had charts! [nervous laugh] What was unprofessional about— oh no, was it the joke I made? Was that inappropriate? [spiraling] How long have they been discussing this? Who else knows? [sharp exhale] Are they gonna call me in later? Am I getting fired over a PowerPoint? [panicked] Oh my god, what if everyone already knows? What if that's why Jessica was being weird to me earlier? [whimper] I can't go back up there. I can't face them knowing they think I'm—
593  [casual] Oh, so I was telling my mom about our spare key situation yesterday. You know how we keep one hidden outside? I was all proud, like, "Oh yeah, we've got the perfect spot, no one would ever think to look there." [conversational] [slight chuckle] It's under this fake rock thing behind the big planter on the side of the house. Like, you'd have to really be looking for it, you know? I was feeling pretty smart about the whole setup. [matter-of-fact] But then after I hung up, I thought, you know what, I should probably just double-check that it's still there. Make sure the rain didn't wash it away or whatever. [light laugh] Just being responsible. [a bit confused] So I go outside and I'm looking around the planter, moving the fake rock, and... it's not there. Like, the rock is there, but no key underneath. Which is weird because I could have sworn— [more concerned] Wait, when did I last actually see it? [pause] I mean, I know we put it there when we moved in, but that was... [trailing off] that was eight months ago. [growing anxiety] Oh god. [sharp exhale] What if someone's been watching us? What if they took it weeks ago and I just never checked? They could have copied it! They could have been in our house! [spiraling] [panicked] What if they're waiting for us to leave? What if they know our schedule? [voice getting higher] We need to change all the locks. Tonight. Oh my god, what if they already made copies of our house keys too?
594  [frustrated] Oh my God, so I went to Target today to get that face wash I've been using, you know the one? And they're completely sold out. Like not even a spot on the shelf, just— just empty. [annoyed] And I'm like, this is the third store I've tried this week, what is happening? So I'm standing there getting all worked up because my skin's been breaking out and I really need this specific one, not some random substitute. [irritated] The whole beauty section was picked over and I'm just like, why didn't I order this online? I'm being so dramatic but I was genuinely getting mad at like— at the universe or whatever. [sigh] [still annoyed but softer] So finally I ask this employee if they have any in the back, and she's like super nice about it, goes to check even though I'm probably being obviously cranky about the whole thing. [surprised] [pleased] And she comes back with one! Like the last one they had, just sitting in some shipment box that hadn't been put out yet. [warm] [slightly embarrassed] She was so sweet about it too, and I realized I'd been like— I'd been taking my weird week out on this random stock situation. [small laugh] Sometimes you just need someone to be helpful to remind you that things work out, you know?
595  [irritated] Oh my god, you would not believe the morning I've had. That dog next door has been barking since like— I don't know, six AM? Maybe earlier. Just non-stop barking at absolutely nothing. [frustrated] [tired] I'm like trying to sleep and it's just "woof woof woof" every two seconds. I was so close to just, like, going over there and being like "can you please control your animal?" But I didn't want to be that neighbor, you know? [annoyed] And it's not even like— it's not like there's anything happening outside. The dog is just... existing and barking about it. For hours. I couldn't even focus on my coffee this morning, I was so [groan] wound up about it. [slightly calmer] [confused] But then like twenty minutes ago, the neighbor actually came over and— wait, someone's at my door again, hold on. [surprised] [warm] Oh wow, okay so it's her again, and she brought me these like homemade chocolate chip cookies? She was like so apologetic about the dog, apparently he gets anxious when she leaves for work and she had no idea how loud he was being. [guilty] [soft] God, now I feel terrible for being so angry about it. Like, she clearly feels bad and these cookies smell amazing. She even asked for my number so she can text me if it happens again. [warm] [slightly embarrassed] That's... actually really sweet of her. I might have judged this whole situation way too harshly.
596  [bitter] [frustrated] So I got my review back from Professor Chen today and I'm just— God, I can't even tell you how brutal it was. Like she completely tore apart my thesis chapter, just red ink everywhere, and I thought I was doing so well with it, you know? [hurt] She said my argument was "unfocused" and that I was "hiding behind jargon instead of making clear points." Like, ouch? I spent three weeks on that chapter and she just... [sigh] she basically said it read like I didn't understand my own research. [defensive] [angry] And I was so mad, like who does she think she is? I mean I get that she's the expert but she didn't have to be so— so harsh about it. I was ready to just, I don't know, switch advisors or something. [quieter] [uncertain] But then I was rereading her notes just now and... um, wait. Actually some of this stuff she's pointing out, it's like— oh. [realizing] Oh no, she's right. This paragraph here, I literally have no idea what I was trying to say. And this whole section is just me using fancy words because I thought it sounded academic, but it's actually... it's actually nonsense. [embarrassed] [hopeful] [half laugh] God, okay. Maybe I needed to hear this. Like it stings but... yeah, I can fix this. I can actually make it better.
597  [frustrated] Dude, I am so pissed right now. I just got my credit card statement and there's this random forty-seven dollar charge that I have no idea what it's for, like— like literally no clue. [angry] So I call the bank and they're like "oh it's from some media company" but they can't tell me which one, and I'm like how is that helpful? [scoff] Forty-seven dollars just disappeared and nobody can explain it. [ranting] I'm going through every single transaction trying to figure out what the hell this is, and the customer service guy is just like "well you must have signed up for something" and I'm like no, no I would remember spending fifty bucks on— on whatever this is. [slowing down] [uncertain] Wait, hold on. Media company... forty-seven dollars... [pause] Oh god, is that— did I sign up for that documentary streaming thing? [realization dawning] Oh my god. [groan] I totally did. Like three months ago when I wanted to watch that true crime series and they had the free trial and I was like "oh I'll just cancel it after." [embarrassed] [slightly sheepish] And then I... completely forgot about it. [nervous laugh] So I've been paying for this thing for months and never even— god, I feel like such an idiot. That poor customer service guy.
598  [casual] So, uh, remember that cold sore I was, um, complaining about last week? I think it's finally, like, on its way out, you know? It's been, um, it's been looking way better the past couple days. [matter-of-fact] I was, uh, I was checking it this morning and it's like— it's not all gross and, um, crusty anymore. [light laugh] Sorry, that's, uh, that's disgusting, but you know what I mean? It just feels, um, it feels normal again. [conversational] Actually, let me just— [pause] yeah, it's definitely, um, it's definitely healing up nice. Barely even, uh, barely even hurts when I— when I touch it like that, so— [stopping short] Wait. Hang on. [sharp exhale] Oh no, that's— that's not... that doesn't look right. It's like, um, it's redder than it was? And now it's, uh— [groan] oh god, it's tingling again. [growing concern] I just— I just touched it. With my finger. The same finger I've been, um, I've been touching everything with today. My phone, the, uh, the coffee cup at work that I— [anxious laugh] that I shared with Jake. [spiraling] Oh my god, I've been, um, I've been going around all day thinking I was fine and I've probably been spreading this to, like, everyone! The door handles, the— the pen I borrowed, I even, uh, I even high-fived Sarah earlier! [whimper] What have I done?
599  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I've got like— I've got all these chargers here and I have no idea which one goes to, uh, to what. This is— this is ridiculous. How do I have so many random chargers? [slightly exasperated] Alright, so this one's obviously for my phone, that's easy enough. But then there's this— this thick black one that could be for, um, could be for my laptop? Or maybe the, uh, the tablet thing. [sigh] Why don't they just label these things? [more focused] Let me just— let me think about this logically. The laptop charger is usually the chunky one, right? So this big rectangular thing is probably— no wait, that doesn't look right either. That might be for the, um, for the old laptop. [trailing off] And then there's these two that look exactly the same but I know, I know one of them is for something completely different. One's probably the, uh, the external hard drive and the other is... [hmm] the speaker maybe? [resigned but amused] You know what? I'm just gonna start plugging things in and see what happens. Very scientific approach. [laugh] I'm sure nothing will explode.
600  [cheerful] Okay, so, um, cereal time. I'm gonna make this nice bowl of— oh, this is gonna be good. Got my favorite bowl, got the, uh, the good cereal, and now we just need some— some milk to make this whole situation, um, complete. [casual] Alright, so we pour the milk and— [pause] huh. That's, um, that's not the right color. That's not— is that supposed to look like that? I mean, milk is supposed to be white, right, not like, uh, not chunky and weird and— [slightly disgusted] Oh. Oh no. [tsk] That's— that's definitely bad milk. Like, really bad milk. I can smell it from here, which is, um, which is not a good sign. Not a good sign at all. [resigned] So now I have this perfectly good bowl of cereal that's just, uh, just sitting there being inedible because I didn't— I didn't check the expiration date like a normal person. [sigh] When did I even buy this milk? Was it last week? Two weeks ago? [muttering] Okay, so, um, do I just throw the whole thing away or can I, like, pick out the cereal? That seems gross, right? The milk touched everything, so it's all contaminated now. [matter-of-fact] Right, so, trash it is. [exhale] Guess I'm having toast for breakfast. Or, um, dry cereal, which is just sad. Maybe I should just go get coffee instead and pretend this never—
601  [muttering] Okay, so I just need to, um, I just need to open this and then I can— [grunt] nope. Nope, that's not, uh, that's not happening. Why do they make these so— I mean, who tightened this thing, like, the Hulk? [slightly strained] Alright, let me just— let me get a better grip here. Maybe if I, um, if I twist it the other way first? No wait, that's— that's not how jars work, that's gonna make it tighter. [sigh] I know how jars work, I'm not an idiot. [determined] Okay okay okay, so the thing is, I need more, uh, more leverage or something. Maybe if I put it between my knees? That's what my mom always— no, that's ridiculous, I'm not gonna— I'm an adult, I should be able to open a jar of, um, of pasta sauce without— [frustrated laugh] You know what? This is actually embarrassing. Like, genuinely embarrassing that I'm being defeated by a— by a condiment right now. [huff] Maybe I should run it under hot water? That's supposed to help, right? The, uh, the heat expands the metal or whatever? [brighter] Oh wait, actually— [grunt of effort] there we go! Finally. See? I just needed to, um, to believe in myself or something. [snort] Sure. That's definitely what it was.
602  [muttering] Okay, so, um, where did I— where did I park? I definitely parked somewhere around here, like, I'm not crazy, right? I mean, uh, I drove here, so the car has to be— it has to be somewhere. [slightly confused] Was it, um, was it level two? Or— no, wait, that doesn't— that doesn't make sense because I remember, uh, I remember walking past that, um, that weird pillar with all the scratches on it. [hmm] Unless that was last time? [picking up pace] Okay okay okay, let me just— let me retrace my steps here. I came in through the, uh, the main entrance, so I would've parked on this side, right? And I was running late, so I probably just grabbed the first spot I— [tsk] but that could be anywhere. [frustrated but mild] Why don't I ever, like, why don't I ever pay attention to this stuff? I literally do this every single time, just wander around like some kind of— [sigh] some kind of parking lot zombie. [brighter, realizing] Wait wait wait. Red Honda. There. Right there behind the, um, the big SUV. [laugh] Cool, so I'm not completely losing it. Yet.
603  [muttering] Okay, so I've been, um, I've been driving around for like fifteen minutes now and I'm— I'm pretty sure I passed that same gas station twice. Which is, uh, which is not great. [sigh] I mean, how hard can it be to find a Target? [slightly defensive] The GPS thing isn't— it's not working right, okay? It keeps saying "turn left" but there's no, um, there's no left to turn onto. Just like a fence and some guy's yard. So that's, uh, that's helpful. Thanks, technology. [contemplative] I could ask someone. There's people around, there's that, um, that lady walking her dog. She probably knows where— I mean, everyone knows where Target is, right? It's not like I'm looking for some obscure— [trails off] [hesitant] But then I have to, like, roll down my window and be like "excuse me" and explain that I'm lost, which is... [groan] I don't know, it feels weird? Like admitting defeat or something. [resigned but practical] Although, I mean, five more minutes of this and I'm gonna be late anyway, so maybe the awkward conversation is, um, is actually the smart move here. Yeah. Okay. Next person I see.
604  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I got here at like— what time is it? Like ten-thirty? And my number is... [sigh] sixty-seven. And they're on, uh, they're on forty-two right now. So that's, um, that's what, like twenty-five people ahead of me? [slightly resigned] I mean, I knew this was gonna take forever, I just— I don't know why I thought today would be different. Like, oh, maybe Tuesday at ten-thirty will be the magic time when the DMV is, uh, is actually efficient. [snort] Right. [conversational] Should've brought a book or something. I've got my phone but the wifi here is— it's terrible, and I don't want to, um, I don't want to burn through all my data just sitting here. Plus my battery's at like thirty percent, which means— [realizing] Oh wait, I think I have one of those little portable chargers in my bag somewhere. Let me just— [rustling] no, that's gum. That's receipts. Why do I have so many— oh, there it is. [more optimistic] Okay, so maybe this won't be so bad. I can just, uh, I can just catch up on podcasts or whatever. Make the best of it, right?
605  [muttering] Okay, so I just need to, um— I need to put some money in this thing and then I can— [sigh] oh. Oh, it's one of those old ones. The, uh, the coin ones. [slightly annoyed] Right, because of course it is. Of course I find the one parking meter in the entire city that doesn't take, um, that doesn't take cards or— or whatever. Just coins. Like it's 1987 or something. [rummaging tone] Okay, let me just— let me check my, uh, my wallet here. Maybe I have some— some quarters? Do I ever have quarters? I feel like I never have quarters when I actually need them. [frustrated but resigned] Thirty-seven cents. I have thirty-seven cents in, um, in random change and I need— what do I need, like a dollar? A dollar fifty? This is— this is great. This is just great. [brightening slightly] Wait, actually, maybe— maybe there's a, uh, there's probably a store or something around here that can break a twenty? I mean, that's a thing, right? People still do that? [trailing off, uncertain] Unless I just... risk it? How often do they actually check these things anyway...
606  [muttering] Okay, so, um, two minutes. Two minutes for leftover pizza. That's— that's not that long, right? I mean, I could, uh, I could probably wait two minutes without, like, completely losing my mind here. [slightly impatient] But I'm so hungry though. Like, really hungry. When did I even eat last? Was it— was it breakfast? Did I have breakfast? [sigh] I feel like I had coffee, but that's not— that's not really food, is it. [drawn out, watching microwave] One minute fifty. Okay. Um, okay, so maybe I should've just eaten it cold? Cold pizza's not that bad, right? People do that. College students do that all the time, so— [faster, second-guessing] No, no, warm pizza is definitely better. Melted cheese and all that. I made the right choice here. I'm just, uh, I'm just being dramatic because I'm hungry and when you're hungry everything takes forever and— [fidgety] One minute twenty. [groan] This is like watching paint dry. Actually, paint probably dries faster than this. Do I have anything else I could— I could grab some crackers or something while I wait? That's not, um, that's not cheating, right? [resigned but lighter] You know what, one minute left. I can do one minute. I'm an adult, I can wait sixty seconds for properly heated food. This is fine.
607  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I pressed the button, and it's just— it's just sitting there. On the, uh, on the seventh floor, apparently. Come on, elevator, what are you— what are you even doing up there? [slightly impatient] I mean, how long does it take to, um, to pick up one person? Unless it's not— unless it's not picking up a person. Maybe it's just, like, stuck? Or someone's holding the door open doing that thing where they're— [sigh] where they're having a whole conversation. [drawn out] Ohhh, wait, it's moving. Finally. Okay, so it's going from seven to— no, wait, it stopped at six. Of course it stopped at six. [tsk] And now someone else is getting on, so I'm gonna be here for, like, another— [resigned] You know what, maybe I should've just taken the stairs. I mean, it's only four flights, and by the time this thing gets down here I could've— I could've been halfway up already. But my knee's been, um, been kind of weird lately, so... [perking up] Oh! There it goes. Three... two... okay, we're in business. See? Sometimes you just gotta, uh, you just gotta wait it out, I guess.
608  [muttering] Okay, so, um, this line is definitely not— it's not moving at all. Like, at all. I've been standing here for, what, like five minutes? And we haven't— we haven't moved even one person forward. [slightly incredulous] What is even— what's even happening up there? I can't see, um, I can't see what the holdup is, but there's gotta be something. Maybe it's like a price check or, uh, or someone's trying to use expired coupons or— [sigh] I don't know. [resigned] I mean, I could switch lines, but then— but then that's always when this one starts moving again, right? That's like, um, that's like a universal law or something. The second you switch, your old line becomes the fast one. [contemplative] Although, honestly, that lady over there looks like she's— she's moving pretty good. Her line's definitely— wait, no, she just stopped too. [tsk] Never mind. [flat] Okay, so I guess we're all just, um, we're all just standing here now. Living our best grocery store life. This is fine. This is, uh, this is totally how I wanted to spend my Saturday.
609  [muttering] Oh god, what is— there's something, um, there's definitely something stuck in my— [tsk] right in the front tooth. Of course. Of course it's right in the, uh, the most visible spot possible. [slightly annoyed] Was it the, um— was it the poppy seed bagel? I mean, that's— that's gotta be it, right? Those things are like, uh, like little dental disasters waiting to happen. But I ate that like, what, two hours ago? [working through it] Okay, so I can, um, I can try to get it with my tongue, but that's— that's not really working, is it? [hmm] And I don't have, uh, I don't have any floss or— wait, do I have a toothpick? Let me just— [slightly panicked] Oh no, how long have I been walking around like this? Did I talk to— did I talk to Sarah in the elevator? [groan] I totally did, and she was being all, um, all smiley and I thought she was just being nice, but maybe she was trying not to, uh, not to stare at my— [resigned] Right. Bathroom. I need to just, um, just go deal with this like a normal person instead of, uh, instead of standing here picking at my teeth like some kind of—
610  [muttering to self] Okay, so, um— I should probably grab some more napkins, right? Like, this is— this is definitely not enough for, uh, for what I'm about to do to this burrito. [nervous laugh] I mean, look at this thing, it's like, it's like a food bomb waiting to go off. [slightly hesitant] But do I just— do I just walk up there and ask? Because the guy already gave me, um, he gave me like three, and I don't want him to think I'm some kind of napkin hoarder or something. [hmm] Although, I mean, three napkins for a burrito this size is kind of— that's kind of insulting, actually. [building confidence] You know what, no, I'm— I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask. It's not weird to want adequate napkin coverage for a meal. That's just, uh, that's just good planning. [pause] Right? Right. [wavering again] But what if he— what if he gives me that look? Like the "oh, this person again" look? I don't— I don't think I can handle that kind of judgment right now. [sigh] Over napkins. This is, um, this is what my life has become. [resigned but determined] Okay, okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna go for it. Worst case scenario, I eat this thing like a cave person and, uh, and wash my hands really thoroughly after. [under breath] Here goes nothing.
611  [muttering] Okay, so I need to, um— I need to send this email, but does this sound... I don't know, does this sound weird? "I hope this finds you well." That's— that's normal, right? [slightly uncertain] Actually, wait, let me— let me read this again. "As per our previous conversation..." Hmm. [tsk] That sounds, um, that sounds kind of snotty? Like, "as per"— who says "as per"? I mean, I do, apparently, but— [faster, second-guessing] Maybe I should just say "like we talked about" instead? But that's too casual for, uh, for Janet from accounting. She's very— she's very proper. Very, um, very email-formal. [drawn out, conflicted] But "I wanted to follow up" sounds like I'm being pushy, right? Like, aggressive? I don't want to be that person who's like, constantly— constantly poking people about stuff. [resigned, quieter] You know what? I'm overthinking this. It's just— it's just an email about the quarterly reports. Janet's not gonna, um, she's not gonna psychoanalyze my word choices. [exhale] Probably. [decisive but still uncertain] Okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna send it. It's fine. It's, uh, it's professional. That's... that's what matters, right?
612  [muttering] Oh, come on. Come on, where is— I know I have it somewhere. The, um, the little card thing for— [sigh] I literally just need the stupid loyalty card and I— wait, did I even bring my wallet? [slightly panicked] Okay, okay, wallet's here, that's good. But the card is— it's not in the, uh, it's not in the little slot where I usually— [groan] Oh no. Oh no no no, I think I left it on the kitchen counter. [resigned but still searching] Maybe it's loose in here somewhere? Like, maybe it just, um, maybe it fell out or something? Let me just— no, that's a receipt. That's another receipt. Why do I have so many— [tsk] this is just grocery receipts from like three weeks ago. [defeated] Yeah, no, it's definitely at home. Sitting right there on the counter next to the, uh, next to the coffee maker where I left it like an idiot. [exhale] Great planning, really. [brightening slightly] But wait, can't I just, um— don't they have like an app now? Or I could just give them my phone number, right? That's— that's a thing they do now.
613  Wait wait wait—are you serious? The one at that, um, that startup you were obsessing over? Oh my god, did they—did they actually call you?
614  Thursday! That's like—that's in three days! [Gasp] Holy shit, I knew that cover letter was gonna work. You spent what, like six hours on it?
615  Okay but it paid off though, right? I mean—god, I'm so proud of you. Like, genuinely. You've been wanting this for months.
616  No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay everything. This is huge! They get like, what, hundreds of applications? And they picked yours. [Chuckle] That's not nothing.
617  You're not gonna—okay, first of all? You're literally the most prepared person I know. Remember when you practiced your elevator pitch until I could recite it myself?
618  How is it—how is it different? You're gonna walk in there, be your usual competent self, and they're gonna love you. Have you, um, have you thought about what you're gonna wear?
619  The boring—okay, it's not boring, it's professional. Classic. Very, like, I-know-what-I'm-doing vibes. Are you doing it over Zoom or—?
620  Oh that's—that's actually better, right? You can get a feel for the place, see if the vibe is good. God, I'm literally so excited for you I could scream. [Laugh]
621  I'm gonna—I'm totally gonna scream. But like, quietly? This is just... after all those rejections and those automated emails, you finally—finally—got through. You did that.
622  Yet! Exactly—yet! See, even you're thinking positively now. That's the energy, that's—that's what they're gonna see on Thursday. Someone who knows they belong there.
623  Wait wait wait—what? Your book got—oh my god, that's incredible! Like, Japanese? That's so... I mean, how does that even feel right now?
624  Oh that's—that's actually kinda trippy, isn't it? Like your words are there but they're not... yours? Did they send you a copy yet?
625  Wrong like—wait, wrong how? Because honestly I'd probably just stare at it for hours [Laugh] like, that's my brain but in symbols I don't understand, y'know?
626  No no no, that's—okay that's actually hilarious though? Like someone read your dark murder mystery and thought "needs more flowers." Did they at least keep the title scary?
627  [Gasp] Stop, I'm gonna—that mental image is killing me. But seriously, this is huge! Are you gonna do like, I dunno, any press stuff over there?
628  Oh god, the time zones alone would—actually wait, that sounds kinda cool? Meeting the person who basically rewrote your whole brain in another language?
629  Okay okay, so she's—she's enthusiastic, that's... I mean, better than someone who hates it, right? [Chuckle] What'd she say?
630  Um, hello? That means you're internationally sardonic now! That's like—that's a whole new level of dry humor. Global snark, babe.
631  Oh no, oh no—your mom's gonna be impossible about this. She's probably already planning your Nobel Prize speech, isn't she?
632  Just—just scribble something [Laugh] she won't know! But honestly though? This is like, actually really amazing. Your words are literally living in a whole other language now. That's... kinda beautiful?
633  Wait wait wait—what happened? Oh my god, did they—did they actually play it? The song? On actual radio?
634  Shut up shut up shut UP! Are you—holy crap, that's literally insane! Which station? Wait, how did you even find out?
635  You heard your own—oh my GOD [Gasp] you heard your own song just like, randomly? That must've been so surreal! I'm actually getting chills right now.
636  Okay but like—good weird or bad weird? Because honestly, I'd probably cry. No, I'd definitely cry. Did you cry?
637  Stop it, that's—that's so sweet! I mean, you worked so hard on that track, like literally months and months in your bedroom just... grinding, y'know?
638  No no no, it's real—it's so real! Did you record it? Please tell me you got like, a video or something [Laugh] for posterity?
639  That's so—honestly that's so you though. Most people would be like, screaming and posting everywhere but you're just... sitting there processing. Did they say your name?
640  Of course they did! [Chuckle] But still, like—your name! On the radio! That's gotta count for something, right? Even if they murdered the pronunciation?
641  Oh my god, your mom—wait, she must be like, totally losing it! That's her baby on the radio! She's probably told everyone at work already, you know she has.
642  Good! Let them all know! This is—ugh, I'm just so proud of you. Like genuinely, actually proud. You did it, babe. You actually did it.
643  Okay, wait—that's not—I wasn't rude, exactly. She started asking me all these questions about my family and I just... I dunno, I got defensive. You know how she can be sometimes.
644  Come on, don't—don't do that. You've literally complained about her being nosy before. I'm not saying I handled it great, but she was kinda pushing boundaries and I—[sigh] I just wanted her to back off.
645  I didn't snap! I just... okay okay, maybe my tone was a little sharp, but honestly? She was asking about my dad's job situation, which—you know that's complicated right now. I wasn't gonna stand there and explain our whole mess.
646  I tried! I literally tried three times and she kept—she kept circling back. Look, I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings, I am, but I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I'm the only one who did something wrong here.
647  And I'm your best friend! That's gotta—that should count for something, right? [scoff] I've dealt with her comments about my clothes, my career choices, my dating life for years. One time I set a boundary and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
648  Oh. Oh, you didn't—you didn't mention there were other people there. That's... okay, that makes it worse, I get that. But I mean, she shouldn't have been grilling me about personal stuff in front of them either, y'know?
649  By asking about my unemployed father? That's—come on, that's not inclusion, that's... I dunno what that is. [frustrated laugh] Look, I'm sorry it went down like that, okay? But I'm not gonna pretend she was being totally appropriate either.
650  That's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to apologize but also explain that there were two sides to this. Can you at least—can you try to see where I'm coming from here?
651  She... what? She cried? [quieter] Okay, I didn't—I didn't know that. That's... shit. I mean, I still think she crossed a line, but I didn't mean to make her cry. That wasn't—that wasn't what I wanted.
652  That's—okay fine, maybe I did. Maybe I'm tired of smiling through her passive-aggressive comments about my life. But I am sorry she cried. I'll—I'll apologize to her, alright? Even though I still think... never mind. I'll apologize.
653  Wait wait wait—what call? Oh my god, is this about the—the thing you interviewed for last week? The one you wouldn't tell me about because you didn't wanna jinx it?
654  SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up. Are you—[Gasp] oh my god, you got it? The actual dream job? Like, THE job?
655  I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry. This is the one at that agency, right? The one with the, um, the rooftop office and everything? The place you've been stalking on LinkedIn for like... forever?
656  Okay okay okay, so like—how are you feeling? Because you're being weirdly calm about this and I'm kinda freaking out FOR you right now, honestly.
657  No no, that's—that's totally normal though. Like when something you've wanted for so long actually happens? Your brain just... doesn't compute, y'know? [Laugh] God, I'm so proud of you.
658  Oh, babe—okay, stop. You're gonna do that thing where you psych yourself out, aren't you? Listen, they wouldn't have picked you if you weren't ready. These people know what they're doing.
659  TRIPLE? Did you just—did you say triple? Holy shit. That's like—I mean, that's life-changing money. You could finally get that stupid expensive coffee machine you're always talking about. [Chuckle]
660  Of course you did, you absolute—wait, you already ordered it? So you ARE excited! See, I knew there was something happening under all that... whatever this calm thing is you're doing.
661  Oh man, your mom's gonna—she's gonna lose it. In the best way, obviously. Are you gonna tell them tonight or...? Actually, y'know what, take your time. This is YOUR moment.
662  That's—yeah, that's actually really smart. But like, we're definitely celebrating this weekend, right? I'm thinking champagne, I'm thinking that fancy place downtown, I'm thinking... basically going completely overboard because hello? Dream job! [Sigh] You did it, babe.
663  [Shouting] Command, we have visual on survivors! [more desperately] There's at least three people clinging to debris down there—we can reach them in two minutes! [voice cracking] Don't you dare tell us to turn back now!
664  [Bitter laugh] Oh, now they care about fuel reserves? [building rage] Where was this concern when they sent us into hurricane conditions? [spitting words] We have enough for the rescue—I've done the calculations twice!
665  [trembling with rage] Seven years flying rescue ops, and this— [voice breaking] this is what breaks me. [Growling] We're forty meters above them! [pleading] Their faces—God, I can see their faces looking up at us!
666  [defeated whisper] Fine. Mark the coordinates. [Choking up] Maybe someone else can collect their bodies when this clears. [venomous] I hope you sleep well knowing we could have saved them. [Bitter snort] Heroes follow orders, right?
667  [Screaming] Override code seven-seven-alpha! [fierce determination] I'm declaring captain's emergency authority! [more calmly] Court martial me later if you want. [Grunt] Right now, I'm dropping this bird down whether you like it or not.
668  [hollow voice] Command's cutting our comm channel. [Disgusted scoff] Cowards can't even listen to what they're doing. [with grim satisfaction] Good thing I don't need their permission to save lives. Descending to fifteen meters now.
669  [strained concentration] Fighting crosswinds here—keep that winch steady! [Gasping breath] Command can take their sanctions and shove them. [proudly] We're pilots, not politicians. [softer] Always have been, always will be. Hold on, almost there!
670  [exhausted] Last survivor coming aboard. [Weak laugh] We did it—all three alive. [bitterly] Wonder if Command will mention this part in our disciplinary hearing. [sarcastic] "Pilots saved three lives against direct orders." Monsters, aren't we?
671  [weary] You know we're done after this. [sighing] They'll ground us permanently, maybe worse. [more firmly] But seeing that kid's eyes when you pulled him up? [peaceful] Worth every consequence coming our way. No regrets here.
672  [sudden realization] Wait—comms are back online. [shocked whisper] Command's... congratulating us? [Bitter laugh] Apparently, media caught the whole thing on satellite. [sarcastically sweet] Now we're heroes. Funny how public pressure changes their tune, isn't it?
673  [concerned] I'm so sorry to hear about this situation with your account. Let me pull up your information—could you please verify your email and the last four digits of card ending in 8924?
674  I can see the unusual activity here, Mr. Thompson. I'm immediately flagging these transactions—orders 7B4X9M2, 7B4X9M3, and [pause] 7B4X9M4—and initiating our fraud protocol.
675  We'll need to secure your account right away. [more firmly] I'm generating a temporary password—X7#mP9@kL2—please write this down and change it within 24 hours to something unique.
676  Absolutely, your fraud case number is FR-20240315-8847. I'm also emailing you a detailed report to j.thompson447@email.com that you can forward to your bank immediately.
677  Actually, good news there! [cheerfully] Your 12,847 points are still intact—they're frozen but safe. [reassuringly] Once we verify your identity through our two-factor system, [more gently] we'll restore full access within 48 hours.
678  I'll text a verification code to your phone ending in 6792 right now. Just read me the six-digit code when you receive it, [pause] and we'll have you secured in minutes.
679  [reassuringly] Perfect, that's correct—you're verified! I've just enabled our enhanced security protocol, which includes login alerts and automatic IP tracking from suspicious locations.
680  Our fraud team works with law enforcement on these cases. The Nevada address and IP data we've collected—198.51.100.42—will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities today.
681  I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson. Your eight-year loyalty means everything to us, so I'm adding a $200 credit and expedited shipping on your next five orders.
682  Exactly right—full refund processing within 3-5 business days. [reassuringly] Your new card ending in 4455 ships tomorrow via overnight delivery, and I'll personally monitor your case until everything's resolved.
683  Thank you for coming in today, Mrs. Chen. I understand you have some concerns about the—the frequency of calls regarding Emma? Let's discuss how we can work together on this.
684  I completely understand your frustration, and believe me, we don't make these calls lightly. [more firmly] However, our policy requires us to contact parents when symptoms appear that could indicate illness.
685  I know it seems excessive, but we're dealing with twenty-two other children here. One contagious illness can spread like wildfire, parents complain, staff gets sick, and suddenly we're understaffed for weeks.
686  Well, perhaps we could... Actually, have you submitted the doctor's note stating she's not contagious? That would certainly help our assessment process.
687  [defensive] Of course we read them, Mrs. Chen. But our teachers aren't medical professionals—they have to err on the side of caution. It's liability, you understand?
688  No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. Your job is absolutely important. Let me... [thoughtful pause] What if we set up a specific symptom threshold for Emma?
689  We could document specific symptoms that don't require immediate pickup—like clear runny nose without fever. I'll personally brief the staff, ensure everyone's on the same page about Emma's situation.
690  Absolutely, I'll draft that today and email it to you. We'll require fever over 100.4, persistent vomiting, or obvious contagious symptoms before calling. [reassuring] Sound fair?
691  We love having Emma here too, she's such a bright little one. These transition months are hard—kids building immunity, parents adjusting. We'll figure this out together.
692  We're not that kind of facility, Mrs. Chen. I'll have that document ready by end of day, and we'll start the new protocol Monday. Let's check in next week, see how it's going?
693  [Disappointed] So basically, everything I've been working toward for the past, what, three years? [Sigh] It's just—gone, I guess.
694  [Happy] Wait wait wait, you're telling me I actually got it? [Laugh] Oh my god, I gotta call my mom right now!
695  [Sarcastic] Oh perfect, just perfect—exactly what I needed to hear today, really. [Tsk] [Slow] Thanks for that wonderful update.
696  [Angry] Are you kidding me with this? [Fast] I turned down two other opportunities for this and now they're just—they're pulling the plug?
697  [Whisper] I, um, I kinda knew this was coming, but hearing it out loud is... [Sigh] different, you know?
698  [Sad] [Slow] I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now, honestly—like, where do I even start over from here?
699  [Happy] [Fast] This changes everything—I mean literally everything—and I'm actually okay with that? [Chuckle] Who would've thought?
700  [Disappointed] Well, there goes my five-year plan, just... [Tsk] whoosh, right out the window.
701  [Shout] You couldn't have told me this BEFORE I signed the lease? [Angry] Seriously?
702  [Slow] So let me get this straight—they're moving the whole thing to, uh, to next year? [Disappointed] [Groan] That's gonna mess up everything.
703  [Happy] I mean, this is kinda terrifying but also, like, exactly the push I needed? [Laugh] [Fast] Time to finally take that leap, right?
704  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh sure, no problem, I'll just completely rearrange my entire life—again. [Sigh] Third time's the charm, right?
705  [Sad] I already told everyone about it, and now I have to—[Whisper] God, this is embarrassing.
706  [Fast] Okay so basically you're saying if I don't decide by tomorrow, I lose both options? [Angry] [Groan] That's completely unfair!
707  [Chuckle] You know what? [Happy] Maybe this is the universe telling me to, I dunno, try something completely different for once.
708  [Disappointed] I literally just bought all the—ugh, never mind, it doesn't matter now. [Tsk] What a waste.
709  [Whisper] [Slow] Should I be, um, should I be more upset about this? Because honestly, I'm kinda... relieved?
710  [Shout] This is amazing! [Happy] [Fast] Do you understand what this means—I can actually go, I can actually do the thing!
711  [Angry] Six months of preparation, and they spring this on me with—what, two days notice? [Sarcastic] [Slow] How very professional of them.
712  [Sad] I guess I always knew it was a long shot, but I really thought—[Sigh] I dunno, I thought maybe this time would be different.
713  Oh god, okay—wait wait wait, let me explain. I didn't mean to tell him, it just—it kinda slipped out when we were talking about work stuff and I was so excited for you that I—
714  I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But we were literally just talking about how his job sucks and I wanted to make him feel better so I mentioned—no, that's not an excuse. [groan] I'm such an idiot.
715  You did. You absolutely did and I completely—I betrayed your trust. That's what I did, right? I betrayed your trust and I feel horrible about it. Like, genuinely sick to my stomach horrible.
716  No no no, I didn't forget, I just—I wasn't thinking. Which is like, the story of my life, right? I never think before I—ugh, sorry, this isn't about me. [nervous laugh] I'm making it about me when I'm the one who screwed up.
717  I wanna fix this so badly. Like, I already told Marcus not to say anything to anyone—not that that helps now, but I tried to do damage control at least? I know that doesn't make it better but—
718  What? No, he—he promised me he wouldn't tell anyone! I specifically made him promise and he... oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. This is—this is all my fault.
719  Maybe not everyone? I mean—no, you're right, Lisa's gonna tell everyone. She always does. God, I really really messed this up for you, didn't I? [sigh] I don't even know what to say except I'm sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply sorry.
720  I know. And that's—that's what kills me the most, y'know? That you trusted me with something this important and I just... I got careless. No, not even careless, just straight-up stupid. You deserved better from me.
721  Please don't say that. I mean—I get it, I do, but please just—give me another chance? I swear I'll never, ever do anything like this again. I'll literally tape my mouth shut if I have to. Whatever it takes to earn your trust back.
722  Yeah. Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need, honestly. I just—I want you to know that our friendship means everything to me and I'm gonna do whatever I can to fix this. Even if it takes forever. Because you're worth it, okay? You're absolutely worth it.
723  Wait wait wait—you WON? Oh my god, I knew it, I literally knew you were gonna take it! That armor looked so—like, professional doesn't even cover it, right?
724  Three months of you basically living in your garage with all that foam and—what was it, the heat gun thing? [Laugh] Remember when you texted me at like 2am about the shoulder pieces?
725  But you figured it out! That's—honestly that's what kills me, you were so stressed about those stupid shoulders and then boom, you actually won the whole thing.
726  Okay but like—who cares if it's plastic? You beat how many people? There were like, what, fifty entries? And yours was the best one there, period.
727  Forty-three! See, that's—that's even better actually. Did they say anything specific about why yours won? Like what the judges were thinking?
728  Um, hello? That means you nailed it! The weathering was literally—I remember you spending forever on that, with the sandpaper and the paint and... [Sigh] god, you worked so hard on this.
729  No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay it. Tutorials don't win contests, okay? You do. Your actual skill and like, dedication does that.
730  People seemed—okay, understatement much? I saw the photos, everyone was literally crowding around you trying to get pictures. You looked kinda uncomfortable actually [Chuckle] but still!
731  Yeah but you—you stayed for the whole thing, right? And honestly seeing you up there getting recognized for something you're genuinely good at? That's huge, y'know?
732  Yes! Oh my god, yes—and this time I'm gonna actually come and see it in person because I'm still—I'm honestly still mad I missed this one. Promise you'll tell me earlier next time?
733  Wait wait wait—you won something? Like, what kind of something? Because the way you're just casually dropping this makes me think it's either, like, a grocery store gift card or—or something huge.
734  I'm sorry, WHAT? [Gasp] No no no, you can't just—hold on. A YEAR? Of flights? To literally anywhere? That's—that's not real. How is that even real?
735  You forgot?! Oh my god, of course you forgot. This is so—wait, so like, business class? Economy? Because honestly even economy would be insane but I'm just trying to wrap my head around this right now.
736  Okay I'm gonna—I might actually pass out. First class! Do you even understand what you're saying? Like, you could literally go to Japan next week! Or—or Paris for lunch! This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard and you're just sitting there like [Laugh] like it's nothing!
737  Yeah no, I mean—that makes sense actually. It's probably like, what do they call it? Shock? Because this is basically winning the lottery except better because money's just money but this is like—this is experiences, y'know?
738  Oh my god, okay okay—we're fixing that immediately. Like, tomorrow. Actually no, today if we can because—wait, when does it start? The year of flights?
739  Are you—okay that's actually kinda sweet that you're overwhelmed because like, most people would already have seventeen trips planned but you're just... [Chuckle] you're just you. We're gonna make a list though, right? Together?
740  Small? Babe, nothing about this is small! But I mean—yeah, okay, maybe don't do like, Australia for your first trip. Unless you want to! God, you could literally go anywhere. This is so unfair but also I'm so happy for you I could cry.
741  Wait—are you serious? Because I was trying really really hard not to invite myself but like, if you're offering... I mean, I'd pay for everything else obviously, hotels and stuff. Oh my god, we could actually do that trip we always talked about!
742  I'm literally—okay I'm getting emotional now because you've been talking about those hot springs for like three years and now it's actually gonna happen? This is the best thing ever. You deserve this so much, you know that?
743  I know, I know how it looks, but work has been absolutely insane lately. Like, I'm not even exaggerating—I've been pulling twelve-hour days and my boss is breathing down my neck about this project that's due—
744  That's not—okay, that's not fair. You're acting like I'm making this up or something. [scoff] I literally sent you a picture of me at my desk at midnight last week, remember?
745  And I felt terrible about that! But what am I supposed to do, tell my boss "sorry, can't stay late, gotta go"? That's not how it works and you know that. I mean, come on.
746  Other people don't have my job! Look, I'm not saying—[sigh]—I get that you're frustrated, okay? I'm frustrated too. But you're making it sound like I'm choosing work over you on purpose.
747  Wow. That's—wow. No, I'm not. I'm trying to keep my job, which, y'know, kinda pays my rent? But sure, make me the villain here.
748  You're basically implying it though! Like, every time I have to reschedule, you get all cold and—and judgey about it. I'm doing my best here, honestly.
749  Yeah, well, my best is all I've got right now. And I'm sorry that's not good enough for you, but I can't just—I can't magically make work disappear. [frustrated laugh] I wish I could.
750  Try harder? Are you—I am trying! God, you have no idea what I'm dealing with right now. The pressure, the deadlines, my manager who's basically—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.
751  Fine. Fine fine. But y'know what? You could also try being a little more understanding instead of just—instead of acting like I'm doing this to hurt you or something.
752  Yeah, well, apparently so does friendship. Look, I'm—I'm sorry I keep having to reschedule, okay? But I'm not gonna apologize for having a demanding job. That's just my life right now.
753  [nervously] Mom, we need to talk about something important. [clearing throat] I've been researching some places that could help with your daily needs. [quieter] Sunrise Manor has excellent reviews, and they have a beautiful garden you'd love.
754  [defensive] That's not fair, Mom! [softer] I'm worried about you living alone. [pleading tone] Last week you left the stove on for hours. What if I hadn't stopped by? Please, just consider looking at the place.
755  [strained voice] Because I can't sleep at night worrying! [more desperately] What happens when you fall again and can't reach the phone? [whispered] I'm scared, Mom. I can't lose you because we waited too long.
756  [gently] You'd still have me, Mom. [more firmly] I'd visit every single day, I promise. [rushed words] They have art classes, book clubs, people your age to talk to. You wouldn't be so isolated anymore.
757  [frustrated shout] This isn't about abandoning you! [voice cracking] It's about keeping you safe when I can't be here. [exhausted] Sarah and I both work sixty hours a week. We're drowning, Mom. We need help too.
758  [angrily] Stop twisting my words! [choking up] You're not unwanted—you're everything to me. [desperately] But I'm failing you here. I can't give you what you need, and watching you struggle alone is killing me inside.
759  [pleading whisper] Then help me find a compromise. [steadier] Maybe we start with day programs, or a part-time aide? [hopefully] We don't have to do everything at once. Just please, work with me here, Mom. Please.
760  [relieved exhale] Dad always was the practical one. [tenderly] He'd want you safe and cared for, Mom. [voice strengthening] That's all I want too. Can we at least visit Sunrise Manor together? No commitments, just looking?
761  [gratefully] Of course, Mom. Every tour, every meeting. [emotional] We're in this together. [quickly] I'll call tomorrow and schedule something for next week. We'll take our time, go at your pace. Thank you for considering it.
762  [laughing softly] You also taught me to ride a bike in that driveway. [meaningfully] Letting go was hard then too, remember? [gentle tone] But you did it because you loved me. Now it's my turn to love you.
763  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson, let me pull up your account. I see here we've had technicians out on the 14th and the 22nd. They reported completing a flush of the lines in your area, specifically grid sector M-7.
764  [sympathetically] That's certainly not acceptable, sir. [more firmly] According to our water quality report from station 12-B, the turbidity levels should be at 0.3 NTU. Has this been happening consistently or—or just during certain times?
765  Sir, our water meets all EPA standards under regulation 40-CFR-141. However, I can schedule another technician for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. [hesitantly] Would you be available at the property then?
766  My supervisor Janet Miller is in a meeting until 3:30 PM. But I can escalate this to our Water Quality Division, case number WQ-7789-X. They handle serious contamination issues within 24 to 48 hours.
767  Let me check our emergency dispatch... Actually, I can get someone there by 4:45 PM today, technician badge number E-7734. They'll need access to both your main shut-off valve and the meter at space 23-C.
768  Yes sir, they'll bring the portable testing kit, model PTK-200. They'll test for iron, manganese, and sediment levels right there on-site. You'll get results immediately, not in two weeks like before.
769  Oh, that's actually very helpful information, multiple addresses indicate a main line issue. [thoughtfully] Let me flag this entire block, zones M-7 through M-9. This might qualify for priority status under code 14-A.
770  No sir, it's absolutely not, and I apologize for this ongoing situation. I'm putting a credit of $45.00 on your account right now, confirmation C-9982. The technician will also bring bottled water, case number BW-445, for immediate use.
771  [assuringly] Yes sir, technician Rodriguez, ID number E-7734, is already assigned. You'll get a text to 555-0147 when he's on the way. Is there anything else I can document in ticket WQ-7789-X for you?
772  Absolutely sir, I've noted the entire 4500 block of Maple Street in the report. You'll receive a follow-up call tomorrow morning from extension 3022. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Thompson, we'll get this resolved.
773  Thank you for calling Extended Shield Warranty Services, how can I— yes, I see your claim here. Unfortunately, your transmission failure isn't covered under your basic powertrain plan.
774  Sir, I understand your frustration, really, but the CVT transmission in your vehicle falls under a different category— it's specifically excluded on page forty-seven of your contract.
775  It's not useless, sir, it covers many components like— water pumps, alternators, starter motors. Just not continuously variable transmissions manufactured after 2018.
776  I can transfer you to our retention department who might— they sometimes have upgrade options available. Though I should mention there's a ninety-day waiting period for pre-existing issues.
777  Sir, I don't work from a script, I'm trying to— Look, let me check with my supervisor. Sometimes we can file an exception for long-term customers.
778  [hurriedly] The supervisor says we can offer a one-time courtesy credit of— five hundred dollars toward your repair. It's not full coverage, but it's something we don't normally do.
779  I really wish I could do more, but— the underwriters set these limits, not me. Have you considered our platinum plan for future coverage?
780  That's not what I— [more calmly] Sir, I'm documenting everything in your file for the review board. Sometimes they overturn initial decisions within five business days.
781  [quickly] I'll email those forms right now, and— actually, I just noticed you might qualify for our hardship provision. [cautiously] It requires additional documentation though.
782  Three months of bank statements, two repair estimates, and— a notarized affidavit stating this failure impacts your ability to work. But it could increase coverage to seventy percent.
783  [Angry] [Fast] Oh come ON, the speed limit is forty-five, not—not twenty, for crying out loud!
784  [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, take your time, it's not like some of us have, um, actual places to be today. [Tsk]
785  [Disappointed] [Sigh] I should've just taken the back roads, I mean, this always happens on this stretch.
786  [Whisper] Please turn, please turn, please just—okay, they're not turning. [Groan]
787  [Happy] [Laugh] You know what, this is so ridiculous it's actually kinda funny at this point.
788  [Shout] The left lane is for PASSING, not for your Sunday cruise! [Angry]
789  [Sad] [Slow] I'm gonna lose this job if I'm late again, and it's not even—I left so early...
790  [Fast] [Disappointed] My boss literally said "don't be late" and here I am stuck behind grandpa going, what, fifteen miles an hour?
791  [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Oh good, now they're slowing down even more, that's—that's exactly what I needed right now.
792  [Angry] I swear, if I miss my daughter's recital because of this—ugh, I can't even... [Groan]
793  [Whisper] [Tsk] Okay, deep breaths, it's just, um, it's just five more minutes, maybe ten, you're fine.
794  [Happy] [Fast] Oh thank god, there's a passing zone coming up in, like, half a mile!
795  [Slow] [Sigh] This is karma, isn't it, for all the times I've been the slow driver?
796  [Shout] [Angry] Are you SERIOUSLY braking on a straight road right now?!
797  [Disappointed] You know, I actually woke up early to avoid this exact—this exact situation, so... [Tsk]
798  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, twenty-two in a fifty zone, we're really breaking speed records today, aren't we?
799  [Sad] [Whisper] Please don't let them notice I'm late, please don't let them—oh, who am I kidding?
800  [Fast] Is that—are they actually on their PHONE right now?! [Angry] [Shout] Unbelievable!
801  [Chuckle] I mean, honestly, at this rate I might as well just, um, call in sick or something. [Disappointed]
802  [Happy] [Laugh] [Fast] YES, finally, they're turning off, oh my god, freedom at last!
803  Wait wait wait—are you serious? Like, you're done done? No more payments ever? Oh my god, that's—that's actually huge! How do you even feel right now?
804  No no no, I totally get that. It's like—when something's been hanging over you for so long, right? And then suddenly it's just... gone? [Laugh] Must be surreal.
805  Jesus, when you put it like that—I mean, that's literally a decade of your life! Do you know how much you ended up paying total? Actually wait, maybe I don't wanna know.
806  The interest is just—ugh, it's criminal, honestly. But hey, you did it! You're free! We should like, we should celebrate or something. This is massive!
807  Okay but it's not though—it's not just money. It's like, freedom? Peace of mind? You can actually save now, or travel, or I dunno, buy stupid stuff without feeling guilty about it! [Sigh] God, I've got like eight more years on mine.
808  Yeah but you—you actually did it. That takes serious discipline. Were you doing like, extra payments and stuff? Or just grinding it out?
809  Oh man, the sacrifices though—I bet you're gonna go wild now, right? Like, finally get that nice apartment or—wait, what's the first thing you're gonna do?
810  [Chuckle] That's so real though. The weight of it, y'know? My sister paid hers off last year and she said she literally cried when she hit submit on that last payment.
811  Wait, you—aww, babe. That's actually really sweet. I mean, you deserve to feel all the feelings about this! It's been like, what, since you graduated? That's your entire twenties basically.
812  No but that's—that's exactly it though! You're starting fresh, no debt, nothing holding you back. That's gotta feel... I mean, incredible doesn't even cover it, right? You're literally free.
813  What? I was just trying to help you with the presentation stuff. You said you were stressed about it, so I thought—I mean, I was literally just giving you advice.
814  Okay okay, but you were clearly struggling with the formatting, and I've done like fifty of these before. I wasn't trying to be—[scoff] I was being a good friend.
815  Because you kept saying you didn't know where to start! I was trying to be thorough, not—god, this is so frustrating. You're making it sound like I think you're stupid or something.
816  Are you—are you serious right now? No! Obviously not! I just thought you wanted help, and now you're acting like I committed some crime by trying to be useful. That's really unfair.
817  I say that to everyone! That's just how I explain things! Look look, I get that maybe my tone was—but honestly, you're reading way too much into this. [frustrated laugh] I can't believe we're even fighting about this.
818  That's—no, that's not true. You're exaggerating because you're mad. And fine, maybe sometimes I over-explain, but it's because I wanna make sure you have all the information. That's not condescending, that's caring.
819  Don't do that. Don't just dismiss what I'm saying. I'm trying to—[sigh] okay, maybe I could've been less detailed or whatever, but you could also just tell me to stop instead of bottling it up and exploding.
820  When? When have you—okay, maybe you've hinted at it, but you've never actually said "hey, stop helping me" directly. I'm not a mind reader, y'know?
821  But apparently you do! Because I genuinely thought I was being supportive! And now I find out you've been secretly hating me for it? That's—that's kinda hurtful too, actually.
822  Fine fine, it's not the same, but I'm just saying—I dunno, maybe we both need to communicate better. Because I really wasn't trying to talk down to you. I just... I guess I didn't realize how it came across.
823  I know, I know—look, I can explain, okay? It's just been really, really complicated lately and I—I meant to go, I swear I did. The first time my car literally wouldn't start, and then—
824  That's—okay that's different though? I mean, not different different, but like... [nervous laugh] God, that sounds bad. I'm not saying therapy isn't important, because it is, it totally is.
825  No no no, that's not—please don't think that. I'm just... scared? Like genuinely terrified actually. Which is so stupid because you were right, I need this, I know I need this.
826  I know you did. And I'm being such a—I'm being awful, aren't I? You put in all this effort finding me someone who takes my insurance and has evening slots and I just... [sigh] I keep chickening out.
827  Because I didn't wanna disappoint you! Which—yeah, I realize how badly that backfired now. But you were so proud when I made that first appointment and I thought I could just... push through it, y'know?
828  I didn't mean to lie, I just—okay no, you're right, I did lie. Not telling you is basically the same thing. God, I'm really—I'm really sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry.
829  Yes! Yes, I do, I really really do. It's just harder than I thought it would be? Like talking about all that stuff with a stranger is—it's terrifying. But I know I gotta do it. [quieter] I know.
830  You're right. You're completely right and I'm—I'm gonna go to the next one. This Thursday, 6 PM, I promise. Actually, wait—would you maybe... would you come with me? Just to the waiting room?
831  No! No, not babysit, just—moral support? I dunno, having you there might make it less scary. But if that's too much to ask after everything, I totally get it, I do.
832  I won't. I promise I won't. Thank you—seriously, thank you so much. [sigh] I know I don't deserve it but... yeah. Thursday, 6 PM. I'll pick you up at 5:30?
833  I—okay, yeah, I wasn't technically sick, but I wasn't feeling great either. Like, mentally, y'know? That's still a kind of sick, isn't it?
834  That's—that's such a harsh way to put it. I just needed some space, and I didn't know how to say that without it becoming this whole thing. Which, [scoff] apparently it became anyway.
835  Look look, I know how it sounds, but sometimes when I tell people I need alone time, they take it personally. Like I'm—I'm rejecting them or something. I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
836  Okay, fine, not great. But honestly? You're kinda proving my point right now. I needed one night to myself and you're acting like I committed some huge betrayal.
837  Could I though? Because every time I've tried to cancel plans before, you get all—you make me feel guilty about it. "But we planned this weeks ago" or "I already moved stuff around." [frustrated laugh] It's exhausting.
838  Isn't it? I mean, come on, you literally showed up at my place last month when I said I was too tired to hang out. You brought soup because you thought I was "probably getting sick."
839  And I—I appreciate that, I do, but sometimes being a good friend means giving people space when they ask for it. Or even when they don't know how to ask for it properly.
840  I'm not saying it was right, okay? I'm not. But I'm also not gonna stand here and pretend like you make it easy to set boundaries. You get so—[sigh] you take everything so personally.
841  And I'm sorry about that, I am. But I was drowning, alright? I needed to just—to not be "on" for anyone. Not even you. Especially not you, actually, because you always wanna talk about deep stuff and I just couldn't that night.
842  Yeah. Yeah, probably. But honestly? The fact that you're this upset about it kinda shows why I didn't. Sometimes I just—I dunno, I need to not be anyone's friend for a minute. And that shouldn't be this hard.
843  [drowsy but contemplative] Okay, so, um— so I could totally just watch the last episode. It's only, like, what, forty-five minutes? Maybe an hour? I mean, I've already— I've already made it through the entire season, so it's not like I can just, uh, just stop now, right? [slightly more animated] But then again, it's already— [yawn] it's already past midnight, and I have that, um, that thing tomorrow morning. What was it? Oh right, the dentist. Which is not, uh, not exactly something I want to be tired for. [wavering] I mean, I could probably— I could probably function on, like, six hours of sleep. That's, um, that's not terrible. People do that all the time, right? Although, uh, although I was pretty useless last time I tried that. [more conflicted] But it's the finale! And I've been waiting to see how this whole, um, this whole thing with Marcus and— and whoever— [trailing off] I mean, what if there's a cliffhanger and I spend all day tomorrow thinking about it anyway? [resigned] Ugh, okay, no, I should— I should probably just go to sleep. Be responsible and all that. The episode will still be there tomorrow, right? [sigh] Right. Sleep it is.
844  [high-pitched squeal] It's open, it's actually open! [breathless] Look at all that beautiful, beautiful money just sitting there waiting for us. [Nervous giggle] I can't believe we pulled this off—my hands won't stop shaking!
845  [whispered urgency] Start grabbing the stacks, the big ones first! [getting faster] We've got maybe three minutes before the silent alarm triggers the backup system. [Manic laugh] My heart's going to explode right out of my chest!
846  [dismissive hiss] It's nothing, just the air conditioning kicking on. [gleefully] Focus on the cash, not the ghosts in your head! [louder] Two minutes left and we're set for life—no more convenience store jobs!
847  [forceful whisper] Then we run NOW! [urgently] Forget the rest, we've got enough to disappear forever. [Heavy breathing] The escape route through the kitchen—remember the plan? Don't look back, just move your legs and follow me!
848  [determined growl] Stop whining and start running! [cheerfully manic] Think about the beach house in Costa Rica, the new identities, the freedom! [Whooping] We're actually doing this—we're actually getting away with the score of the century!
849  [victorious scream] The parking lot's empty! [breathlessly fast] Throw the bags in back and gun it before anyone realizes what happened! [Cackling] They'll be telling stories about us for decades—the phantom thieves who vanished!
850  [commanding tone] Drive normal, don't speed! [nervously] Cops look for people driving crazy after heists. [Suppressed squeal] Turn left at the light, nice and easy, just two regular people heading home from a late shift.
851  [exhausted laugh] We did it, partner. [emotionally] Five years of planning, all those nights studying blueprints, learning the guard rotations. [Soft crying] It actually worked—we're rich and we're free and nobody got hurt!
852  [suddenly serious] Wait, pull over here first. [cautiously] We need to check for tracking devices before we go any further. [Nervous muttering] The casino's too quiet—they should've sounded the main alarms by now.
853  [relieved sigh] Nothing—the bills are clean. [joyfully] No dye packs, no trackers, just beautiful untraceable cash! [Getting louder] Start the car, we're burning moonlight! Next stop, our brand new lives as millionaire ghosts!
854  I'm so sorry to hear about this situation with your account. Let me pull up your information—could you please verify [calmly] your email and the last four digits of card ending in 8924?
855  I can see the unusual activity here, Mr. Thompson. I'm immediately flagging these transactions—orders 7B4X9M2, 7B4X9M3, and 7B4X9M4—and initiating our fraud protocol.
856  [gently] We'll need to secure your account right away. I'm generating a temporary password—X7#mP9@kL2—please write this down and change it within 24 hours to something unique.
857  [helpfully] Absolutely, your fraud case number is FR-20240315-8847. I'm also emailing you a detailed report to [carefully] j.thompson447@email.com that you can forward to your bank immediately.
858  Actually, good news there! [cheerfully] Your 12,847 points are still intact—they're frozen but safe. Once we verify your identity through our two-factor system, we'll restore full access within 48 hours.
859  [patiently] I'll text a verification code to your phone ending in 6792 right now. Just read me the six-digit code when you receive it, and we'll have you secured in minutes.
860  Perfect, that's correct—you're verified! I've just enabled our enhanced security protocol, which includes login alerts and automatic IP tracking from suspicious locations.

862  I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson. Your eight-year loyalty means everything to us, so I'm adding a $200 credit and expedited shipping on your next five orders.
863  [confidently] Exactly right—full refund processing within 3-5 business days. Your new card ending in 4455 ships tomorrow via overnight delivery, and I'll personally monitor your case until everything's resolved.
864  Hello! Welcome to ShopMax customer support, I'm here to help you today. I see you're reaching out about loyalty points—how can I assist you with your account?
865  Oh no, that's definitely concerning! Let me pull up your account right away—can you provide your email or member ID? We'll get this sorted out quickly for you.
866  No worries at all, take your time! [helpfully] I can also look you up by phone number if that's easier? [brisk tone] Just need to verify a few details to access your account securely.
867  [quickly] Perfect, found you! Janet Miller, premium member since 2019. I can see there was a points adjustment on October 15th—looks like they expired due to twelve months of inactivity.
868  [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration! [quickly] Let me check those recent purchases—ah yes, I see them here. [confused] That's strange, they should have kept your points active, but the system might not have registered them properly.
869  Actually, yes! Since this appears to be a system error, I can absolutely restore those points. I'm crediting 8,000 points back right now, plus adding 500 bonus points for the inconvenience!
870  It's my pleasure, truly! The points should appear within 24 hours, and I've added a note to prevent future expiration issues. Is there anything else weighing on you today that I can help with?
871  Oh, I absolutely understand—we all have those seasons! Sometimes a little win with loyalty points can brighten things up. I've also emailed you a 20% off coupon for your next purchase.
872  That sounds like a wonderful idea! Self-care is important. Our wellness section has some great items, and your points work on everything except gift cards.
873  [brightly] Excellent choice! We actually have those on special this week. With your points and coupon, you'd get an amazing deal. [warmly] Take care of yourself, Janet—you deserve it!
874  [Angry] I didn't, um, I didn't ask for your input on my—actually, you know what? [Shout] Just stop talking!
875  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, thanks so much for that, like, totally life-changing observation about my face. [Tsk] Really needed that today.
876  [Disappointed] My mom does this too, y'know, the whole "helpful suggestions" thing about how I dress. [Sigh]
877  [Happy] You think my hair looks weird? [Laugh] Good! That's kinda the whole point, actually.
878  [Fast] I mean, I get it, okay, everyone has opinions, but like—why do people think I wanna hear them?
879  [Whisper] Did she really just say that to me? [Slow] In front of everyone at the meeting?
880  [Sad] I was feeling, um, pretty confident this morning before you—never mind. [Sigh] It doesn't matter.
881  [Angry] Listen, my body is not up for discussion, alright? [Groan] We've been over this like fifty times!
882  [Chuckle] Wait wait wait, you're giving ME fashion advice? [Sarcastic] Have you, uh, looked in a mirror lately?
883  [Slow] So basically what you're saying is—hold on, let me get this straight—you think I should change everything about myself?
884  [Disappointed] I thought we were past this kind of, you know, superficial nonsense. [Tsk] Guess not.
885  [Happy] Actually, that "flaw" you're pointing out? [Chuckle] It's literally my favorite thing about how I look.
886  [Fast] Okay so here's the thing—I didn't wake up wondering what random strangers think about my outfit, but thanks anyway!
887  [Whisper] Could we maybe, I dunno, talk about literally anything else? [Sad] Please?
888  [Shout] It's my face! [Angry] I've had it for thirty years and I'm kinda attached to it, okay?
889  [Sarcastic] Mm-hmm, fascinating, tell me more about how I should, like, completely reinvent myself for your comfort. [Groan]
890  [Slow] You know what's funny? [Disappointed] Nobody asked—literally nobody asked for your hot take on my weight.
891  [Happy] I'm gonna take that as a compliment even though you definitely—yeah, you didn't mean it that way. [Laugh]
892  [Sad] Every single time we hang out, it's something about my—I can't do this anymore, honestly. [Sigh]
893  [Fast] Sorry, what was that? [Sarcastic] I couldn't hear you over the sound of me not caring about your beauty standards.
894  [excited] Oh my God, I'm actually doing it! I'm— I'm really moving to Portland next month. I signed the lease this morning and I just keep staring at the keys like, holy shit, this is real. You know how long I've been talking about getting out of this city, and it's finally happening. [excited] [slightly overwhelmed] The apartment is perfect too, like it has this little balcony that overlooks this tree-lined street, and there's a coffee shop right downstairs that smells like— [small laugh] okay I'm being ridiculous but I'm just so pumped about this. [stress creeping in] But oh God, the packing though. I started looking at my closet last night and I was like, how did I accumulate so much stuff? Like when did I become a person who owns three different sets of measuring cups? I don't even cook that much, what is wrong with me? [increasingly stressed] And I have like two weeks to get everything sorted and I haven't even started with the books yet, or the kitchen, or— [groan] the storage unit, Jesus, I forgot about the storage unit. I'm gonna have to take time off work and I don't even know where to rent a truck and— [surprised] [phone buzzing] Oh wait, hold on, Sarah's texting me... [touched] [relieved] Oh wow. She's asking if I need help packing this weekend, and she's got like a whole group chat going with Mike and Jenny and... [warm] God, I have really good friends. Yeah, okay, I think I'm gonna be fine.
895  What? No, I—wait, what do you mean? I didn't forget anything, I don't think? Unless—oh god, did I miss something important?
896  Ten years of—oh. OH. Oh no no no, our friendship anniversary. That's—that's today? [groan] I'm such an idiot, I can't believe I—I had it in my calendar and everything.
897  No, seriously, I did! I swear I did. I just—this week has been absolutely insane with work and I've been so scattered, but that's not an excuse. I know it's not.
898  I know, I know we have. And it means—god, it means everything to me, you know that, right? Like, you're literally my best friend and I just completely spaced on the most important—I'm the worst. [nervous laugh] I'm actually the worst friend ever.
899  Please don't—okay, I deserve that. But like, can I just—let me make it up to you? We can go to that place you love, the one with the really good pasta? Tonight, my treat, obviously.
900  No, you're right, it's not. It's not about—I mean, it's about me forgetting something that matters. Something that should've been the first thing on my mind today. I just... I dunno, I've been so caught up in my own stuff lately.
901  Have I been—oh god, have I been a terrible friend lately? Not just today but like, in general? Because if I have, you need to tell me. Please.
902  [sigh] I didn't realize—actually no, that's a lie. I think I did realize, I just kept telling myself it was temporary, y'know? Like "oh, after this project" or "after this deadline" but there's always another one.
903  That's fair. That's—that's completely fair. And I hate that I've become that person who just... forgets what actually matters. You matter. You matter so much and I've been taking that for granted, haven't I?
904  I do. I really do. And I'm gonna—I wanna fix this. Not just with dinner or whatever, but like, actually being present again. Being the friend you deserve. Because ten years is—it's huge, and you've been there through literally everything, and I just... I'm sorry. Really, genuinely sorry.
905  Oh my god, I—wait, that's this Saturday? I thought it was next—no no no, you're right, it's this Saturday. I'm such an idiot.
906  I didn't—okay, yeah, I did, but I honestly forgot about the concert. My cousin called and she's only in town for like one day and I just—I wasn't thinking. [nervous laugh] That's not an excuse, I know.
907  I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But she literally just told me yesterday she was coming and I got all excited and—god, I completely blanked on our plans. I'm so sorry.
908  Oh no. Oh no no no, I'll—I'll pay you back, obviously. Or maybe I can—wait, what time is the concert? Maybe I can do both? Like, I could meet my cousin earlier and then—
909  Please don't be like that. I really—I really wanna go with you. We've been talking about this band for months, I know. [sigh] I just completely messed up the dates in my head.
910  That's not—okay, that's kinda fair. I have done this before. But I'm trying to be better about it, I swear. I even got that planner app you recommended and everything.
911  I deserve that. I do. Look, what if I—what if I reschedule with my cousin? I'll just tell her something came up. Because honestly, you're more important and we planned this first and I should've remembered.
912  But I do want to! That's what I'm trying to—I genuinely forgot, it wasn't that I didn't wanna go. [groan] I'm just really bad at keeping track of stuff, but that doesn't mean I don't care.
913  Because I'm—because I'm a disaster, basically? I don't mean to be. I get overwhelmed and then I say yes to everything and then—then this happens. And I hate that I keep disappointing you. I really, really hate it.
914  I know. And we're gonna, okay? I'm—I'm texting my cousin right now. Literally right now. There, sent. Saturday is ours, just like we planned. And I'm gonna put like five reminders in my phone so this never happens again. I promise.
915  [contemplative] Okay, so, um, there's like half this sandwich left, and I'm— I'm pretty full, but it's a really good sandwich, you know? Like, I don't want to just— I mean, it seems wasteful to just leave it here, right? But then again, am I actually gonna eat it later, or is it just gonna sit in my fridge and, uh, and get all sad and soggy? [slightly indecisive] I could ask for a box. That's— that's normal, right? People do that. But it's just, um, it's just half a sandwich, not like a whole meal or whatever. [sigh] I don't know, maybe that's weird? Like, "excuse me, can I get a to-go container for my, uh, for my sandwich remnants?" [muttering] But I paid twelve dollars for this thing, so— I mean, that's like six dollars just sitting there. Six dollars! That's, um, that's a coffee. That's a really good coffee, actually. [resigned but practical] Okay, you know what? I'm doing it. I'm taking the sandwich home. Future me will probably thank current me, or, uh, or future me will find mystery sandwich in the fridge and be confused, but— [laugh] but that's future me's problem, right?
916  [shaking voice] I can't stop trembling. [Sobbing laugh] When you landed, the audience gasped and I thought we'd failed, but then— [getting louder] they erupted! My legs are jelly but my heart is soaring through the ceiling!
917  [slow, disbelieving] Your hands found my waist at exactly the right millisecond. [faster now] Like magnets clicking into place after searching forever. [Gasp] I flew! Actually flew for those three seconds—weightless, fearless, infinite!
918  [hysterical giggle] The spotlight hit us perfectly too! [in wonder] Like the universe conspired for this exact moment. [Whimper] I'm crying into my costume and makeup is everywhere but who even cares anymore? We're legends!
919  [quavering] Remember when I dropped you last month? [stronger] You got a concussion and I thought you'd quit. [Sob] But you came back the next day, trusting me completely. That trust just paid off!
920  [reverent tone] Opening night magic is real. [building energy] Every superstition, every ritual, every prayer to the dance gods worked. [explosive joy] We transformed impossible into inevitable! My whole life led to these three seconds!
921  [trembling] The other dancers are crying too. [steadier] Even Marcus, who never shows emotion, has tears streaming. [Whispered scream] We inspired them! We showed everyone that impossible is just another word for not yet!
922  [laughing through tears] Your face during the lift! [quieter] Pure concentration then sudden joy, like sunrise breaking. [getting louder] The audience saw it too—that's when they started screaming! We gave them magic tonight!
923  [shaky exhale] I can't feel my legs anymore. [more solidly] Doesn't matter—I could float home on this feeling alone. [Sob-laugh] We're going to remember this forever, when we're old, we'll still remember!
924  [overwhelmed] My hands are still shaking—look! [steadying] But not from fear anymore, from pure electricity. [Gasp] We channeled lightning through our bodies and survived! We're made of stars and stubborn dreams!
925  [peaceful exhaustion] Let's just stand here one more minute. [deeper, satisfied] Before the reviews, before tomorrow's show, before reality returns. [whispered triumph] Right now we're infinite, we're perfect, we're exactly who we dreamed we'd become!
926  Oh dear, that doesn't sound right at all. Can you please provide me your customer ID number? It should be on your account card—starts with CL and then eight digits.
927  Perfect, I've got your account pulled up here, Ms. Thompson. I see your last prescription update was three months ago—Doctor Reynolds at 4521 Oak Street, correct?
928  I completely understand your concern. [carefully] According to our records, your prescription shows right eye negative 2.25, left eye negative 2.50. The numbers you mentioned don't match what we have on file.
929  OptiClear? Ma'am, our records show we sent you AquaVision Plus lenses last month. Could you check if maybe you received someone else's order by mistake?
930  That would definitely explain the dizziness! Please remove those immediately and rinse your eyes with saline solution. Would you like me to rush-ship your correct prescription to arrive tomorrow at no extra charge?
931  Good afternoon, tech support, I see you have ticket number 45782 open. Let me just pull that up—okay, yes, the printer issue from last Tuesday. How can I help you today?
932  Oh, I see there's been some... miscommunication in our system. [rapidly] Let me check the previous notes—printer error, driver reinstall attempted, firmware update. Did you complete all these troubleshooting steps?
933  Right, Jeff's notes here say the issue was resolved. But you're saying it's not working? [more briskly] Can you tell me exactly what happens when you try to print now?
934  [hurriedly] Okay, grinding noise indicates a mechanical issue, not software. This should've been escalated to hardware support immediately. I'm going to transfer you to—actually, wait, let me handle this myself.
935  I understand your frustration completely. Here's what I'll do—I'm scheduling a technician for tomorrow morning, between 9 and 11. No more phone tag, no more transfers, just someone at your door.
936  That's unacceptable, and I apologize. I'm putting a priority flag on this ticket, linking all previous attempts, and—I'm giving you my direct extension: 4421. Call me if they don't show.
937  [briskly] If they can't fix it on-site, I've already approved a replacement unit. It'll be delivered the same day, pre-configured with your network settings. We should've done this two weeks ago.
938  Exactly right, and I'm sending you a confirmation email now with everything documented. My name's Maria, by the way. [firmly] I'll be monitoring this ticket until it's completely resolved.
939  I completely understand, two weeks is far too long for a basic printer issue. The email should be in your inbox now—confirm you received it? [determined] We're getting this fixed tomorrow.
940  [briskly] There absolutely is, and if anyone gives you trouble, reference case number PR-45782-ESCALATED. That'll flag it in our system as a management-monitored issue. Anything else before we wrap up?
941  [Happy] Oh wow, this is—this is really something! [Laugh] I mean, I've never seen anything quite like it before, honestly.
942  [Fast] No no no, I love it, I really do! [Nervous laugh] It's just, um, I'm kinda overwhelmed right now, you know?
943  [Slow] You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble... [Sigh] Really, this must've taken you, what, like hours to find?
944  [Happy] [Shout] Are you kidding me right now? This is exactly what I—well, it's definitely a surprise!
945  [Whisper] I'm gonna put this somewhere really special, like, right where everyone can see it. [Chuckle] Obviously.
946  [Disappointed] Oh, you actually remembered I mentioned this that one time... [Fast] That's so thoughtful of you, seriously!
947  [Sarcastic] How did you even know I needed another one of these? [Laugh] I mean, psychic much?
948  [Happy] [Slow] This is so... unique, I guess is the word I'm looking for?
949  [Angry] Wait, you kept the receipt, right? [Fast] Not that I'd return it or anything—I just, um, like to have them.
950  [Sad] I can't believe you spent money on me when you're—[Sigh] I mean, thank you, this is really nice.
951  [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Slow] I was literally just thinking about getting myself one of these... sort of.
952  [Happy] It's perfect! [Tsk] Well, I mean, it's gonna be perfect once I figure out where to, uh, where to put it.
953  [Whisper] [Fast] Is everyone watching me open this? Because I feel like—okay, yeah, they're definitely all staring right now.
954  [Disappointed] This is exactly like the one my ex gave me—[Laugh] But yours is way better, obviously!
955  [Shout] Mom, come look at what I got! [Sarcastic] You're gonna absolutely love this, I promise.
956  [Happy] I'm literally speechless right now, which is—[Groan] Okay, that's not true, but you know what I mean.
957  [Slow] So this is what you were being all secretive about last week? [Chuckle] I honestly thought you were planning something else entirely.
958  [Fast] [Angry] No, I'm not crying, it's just—these are happy tears, alright? Totally, completely happy.
959  [Sigh] You really didn't have to—I mean, we said no gifts this year, but... [Happy] whatever, rules are meant to be broken, right?
960  [Sarcastic] I've been dropping hints about this for months! [Slow] Well, not this exactly, but, um, something in this general... category?
961  [annoyed] So I got that throw pillow I ordered online and of course— of course they sent me the wrong color. I ordered the sage green one, you know, the one I showed you? And they send me this like, dusty blue thing instead. [frustrated] I was so ready to just, like, immediately box it back up and write some passive-aggressive email about how hard is it to read an order form, you know? Like I specifically picked sage green because it would go with my couch and now I have to deal with returning it and waiting another week... [irritated] [sigh] And I'm sitting there holding this thing, getting ready to— to take photos for the complaint email, and I'm like looking at it next to my couch and I'm just— [surprised] [trailing off] Oh. Wait, actually... this looks... this actually looks really good? Like better than I thought it would? [contemplative] The blue is like, it's picking up that accent color in my rug that I totally forgot about. And with the throw blanket it's like— oh wow, it actually ties the whole room together way better than the green would have. [sheepish] [small laugh] God, I almost sent that angry email. This is like, this is actually perfect. Sometimes the universe knows better than you do, I guess? [chuckle] I should probably send them a thank you instead.
962  Wait wait wait—what? An award? Oh my god, that's—that's amazing! What kind of award? Like employee of the month or something bigger?
963  Are you—[Gasp] okay, no, that's huge! Employee of the YEAR? Out of like, what, hundreds of people? That's not just some random thing!
964  Oh no no no, I know you hate that stuff. But like—can we just talk about how you literally crushed it this year? I mean, honestly, you deserve this.
965  Uh, yeah, except most people "just doing their job" don't get—y'know—giant awards for it. Did they give you anything good at least? Like a bonus or...?
966  Okay okay, the plaque is kinda whatever but five hundred bucks? That's—I mean, that's actually decent. [Chuckle] What're you gonna do with it?
967  Groceries? Are you—no! That's celebration money! You gotta like, treat yourself or something. Get that fancy coffee maker you've been talking about forever.
968  Wait, what? Your boss was surprised? That's so—ugh, typical. You basically carry that entire department and they're "surprised"? Whatever, their opinion literally doesn't matter.
969  She—oh. Oh! So she was like, good surprised? Not bad surprised? Because that's totally different, that's actually kinda sweet that she fought for you.
970  Yeah but like—awkward for twenty minutes versus having actual proof you're killing it at work? I dunno, seems worth it to me. [Sigh] You're gonna put the plaque up, right?
971  Oh my god, you're—you're impossible! At least take a picture of it before it like, melts in there or something. Your mom's gonna wanna see it, y'know?
972  I—okay, yes, I forgot about dinner, but honestly, I've had like three deadlines this week and my mom's been calling me every five minutes about the surgery thing, so I'm kinda drowning here.
973  I know, I know we did, and I'm sorry, but you're acting like I deliberately stood you up when—[sigh]—when literally my entire life is falling apart right now. That's not exactly fair.
974  Okay, that's—that sucks, and I should've called, but my phone died at work and I didn't even realize what day it was until I got home. You could maybe cut me some slack here?
975  Come on, that's—the third time in what, two years? And one of those was when my car literally broke down. You're keeping score now? [frustrated laugh] That's great.
976  You're not being—okay okay, I get that you're upset, but "forgotten" is kinda dramatic. I've been there for you through everything, y'know? One bad month doesn't erase all that.
977  Well that's—[scoff]—that's really nice to hear. Super understanding of you while I'm dealing with my mom possibly having cancer and trying not to lose my job.
978  Yeah, you're right, I could've. But I was in back-to-back meetings until seven and then—I mean, honestly? I just crashed. I'm barely keeping my head above water here.
979  Okay but—wait, what? You never said you had stuff going on. How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me anything?
980  That's not—come on, that's not fair. I've been asking how you are, but you always just say "fine" and change the subject. I can't read your mind, y'know?
981  No, don't—don't do that. Look look, I messed up tonight, I did, but you shutting down like this isn't gonna fix anything. Can we just—I dunno, can we talk about this properly?
982  Wait wait wait—what? You applied? When did you even—oh my god, which program? This is huge!
983  Okay, um, I'm literally trying not to scream right now because—State? That's like, that's one of the best programs in the country, right? You must be freaking out!
984  Oh no no no, don't do that thing where you—[Sigh] where you downplay everything. This is incredible! Have you told your parents yet?
985  Are you... are you actually gonna go? Because like, I mean, you don't sound super excited about it, which is kinda throwing me off honestly.
986  Okay but—wait, "should be"? That's different from actually being excited. What's really going on? Because this is supposed to be like, your dream, right?
987  Oh. Oh shit, okay, so you're—you're having second thoughts? That's totally normal though! Like, big life changes are [Chuckle] terrifying, trust me.
988  Um, hello? They literally chose you. Out of probably hundreds of people, they picked you because—because you're brilliant, okay? You gotta know that.
989  No no, I really—look, remember when you helped me understand that whole neuroscience thing for my presentation? You made it sound so easy, and I was like, completely lost before.
990  Basic to you! Which is exactly my point. You're gonna—[Laugh] you're gonna be that annoying smart person that makes everyone else feel dumb without even trying.
991  Okay first of all, rude, because you have me. Second, you're gonna find your people there, I promise. The other weirdos who think analyzing brain scans is fun or whatever.
992  [checking the time, slightly impatient] Okay, so, um, they said they'd be here at, what, two-thirty? And it's now— it's now two forty-five, so that's, uh, that's fifteen minutes. Which isn't, like, terrible, but still. I mean, I got here on time, so— [muttering] Maybe I should text them? But I don't want to be, um, I don't want to be that person who's like, constantly checking up on— you know what I mean? Like, traffic happens, right? Or maybe they're, uh, maybe they're just running behind. [slightly defensive] I mean, I'm not mad or anything, it's just— okay, I'm a little annoyed because I, um, I specifically left early to get here and now I'm just, like, standing here looking— [sigh] looking like I don't have anything better to do. [brightening slightly] Oh wait, is that— no, that's not them. That's just some random person with the same, uh, same jacket or whatever. [laugh] Great, now I'm like a detective trying to spot— [resigned, checking phone again] Okay, five more minutes and then I'll text. That's, um, that's reasonable, right?
993  [exhausted] I haven't slept more than four hours in weeks. [quieter] Between Jamie's ear infection and the overnight shifts at the diner, [deep sigh] I'm basically a walking zombie. How do you manage everything so perfectly?
994  [bitter] At least you have someone to not speak to. [voice breaking] Yesterday, Jamie asked why daddy never visits anymore, and I just [choked up] stood there washing dishes, pretending I didn't hear her question through my tears.
995  [shocked] You're trying? [softer] You never mentioned that. [frustrated growl] God, here I am complaining about no sleep when I have the one thing you actually want. Life's twisted joke, right?
996  [firmly] You're right, I'm sorry. [getting louder] It's just hard watching everyone's highlight reels on Facebook while I'm counting quarters for gas money. [deflated] Jamie deserves so much more than mac and cheese five nights a week.
997  [suspicious] Are you serious? [voice rising hopefully] Because I can't handle pity right now, but an actual job? [rushed words] That would change everything—Jamie could finally get those dance lessons she keeps asking about!
998  [crying softly] Thank you. [stronger] You know, Mom always said we were two sides of the same coin. [thoughtful pause] Maybe she meant we'd need each other to feel whole, not to measure our worth against.
999  [laughing through tears] And now look at us—still comparing portions. [more seriously] But maybe it's time we shared the plate instead. [hopeful] Your stability, my flexibility—together we might actually build something better than either life alone.
1000  [overwhelmed] This is really happening? [steadier] After two years of drowning, I forgot what hope felt like. [soft sob] Jamie's going to flip when she sees your pool—she's been practicing holding her breath in the bathtub.
1001  [relieved sigh] Those events sound like torture. [sarcastically] My social life consists of other exhausted moms at the laundromat. [more genuine] But at least we're honest about our disasters—there's something freeing about having nothing left to pretend about.
1002  [determined] Then let's stop keeping score. [building energy] Your pool, my honesty, your money, my time—we'll throw it all in together. [firm] Our kids, whenever they come, will grow up knowing family means sharing everything, especially the struggles.
1003  Good morning! The quiet hours are 10pm to 8am, as stated in section 4B. However, I believe you might be looking at section 4C, which discusses the pool area restrictions from 10am to 8pm.
1004  The $75 fee in section 12A is only for noise violations during quiet hours. It's not monthly—it's per incident. [clarifying tone] Your monthly fees are just the $1,850 rent plus $25 for parking spot B-47.
1005  Any guest staying more than 14 consecutive days needs to be registered. [reassuring] Three nights a week is perfectly fine! Just fill out form G-2019 if he ever stays two weeks straight, which is available at the office.
1006  Sarah's referring to last year's form—we updated it. The $200 is refundable when you move out, and [cheerfully] it covers your key fob, pool access, and gym entry for unit 7-C.
1007  You're correct—utilities are included up to $150 monthly. Section 9F explains that anything over $150 gets prorated among units. Last month your portion was only $12.50 extra, remember?
1008  Rent is always due on the 1st. The portal shows the 3rd because that's your grace period deadline. After the 3rd, there's a $50 late fee, as outlined in section 2B, subsection 4.
1009  I understand it's overwhelming. I'll email you our tenant quick-reference guide to apartment7c@gmail.com. It covers all the main points in just two pages, including important dates and fees.
1010  [cautiously] Subletting requires approval 60 days in advance, per section 15D. You'll need to submit form SL-2024, provide their credit check, and they'll need to meet our 650 minimum credit score requirement.
1011  There is a $300 expedited processing fee for rush subletting requests. If you get me the paperwork by noon today, I might be able to push it through in 10 business days.
1012  [patiently amused] All forms are on our tenant portal at oakwoodapts.com/tenant. Use your login—it's your unit number 7C and the password you created. Or just stop by the office, we're open until 6pm today!
1013  Good afternoon, this is Sarah from PowerGrid Utilities, how can I assist you today? [warmly] I see you're calling from the account registered to—let me just pull that up for you.
1014  I completely understand your frustration, sir, and I'm—I'm truly sorry about this ongoing issue. Let me check your account history right away to see what's been happening with those meter readings.
1015  [more reassuringly] Sir, I can see the pattern here and—yes, you're absolutely right, this shouldn't have gone on this long. I'm escalating this immediately to our field service team, and here's what we'll do differently this time.
1016  Right, so—listen, I'm scheduling a priority appointment for tomorrow between 8 and 12. The technician will call you thirty minutes before arrival, and if they can't access it, they'll need to document exactly why with photos.
1017  Absolutely, once we get the actual reading, we'll do a full reconciliation going back four months. [confidently] Any overcharges will be credited to your account immediately, or—or we can issue a refund check if you prefer.
1018  Already typing it up as we speak—you'll have that confirmation email within five minutes. It'll include my direct extension, case number 78432, and the service manager's contact as backup.
1019  That's completely fair, and honestly, you have every right to do that. Between us, sometimes that's what it takes to get things moving properly around here.
1020  I prefer to call it... external motivation. But seriously, I've flagged this as critical, and I'll personally follow up tomorrow afternoon to confirm everything went smoothly.
1021  You won't need to, I promise you that. [quickly] I'm also adding a note for monthly manual reads for the next three months, just to ensure this never happens again.
1022  Thank you, sir—I've been doing this for eight years, and trust me, I've seen it all. Your email confirmation just went through; check your inbox and let me know if you need anything else.
1023  [Shout] No way, no way, NO WAY! [Fast] He was the killer the whole time and I just—I literally called this in episode two!
1024  [Slow] So you're telling me... she's been dead for, like, three seasons? [Whisper] That's actually kind of brilliant.
1025  [Disappointed] I mean, time travel, really? [Sigh] They couldn't come up with anything more original than that?
1026  [Happy] Oh my god, they're siblings! [Laugh] I totally shipped them earlier and now I'm, uh, I'm feeling pretty weird about that.
1027  [Sarcastic] Wow, the butler did it. [Tsk] How incredibly unexpected and not at all cliché.
1028  [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Fast] Six years of watching this show and they just—they literally just erased everything!
1029  [Whisper] Wait, wait, go back. [Slow] Did he just say what I think he said about her mother?
1030  [Sad] I can't believe they actually killed him off like that—I mean, he was basically the heart of the whole series. [Sigh]
1031  [Chuckle] Okay so the dog was actually, um, was actually an alien this whole time? [Happy] That's so stupid it's kinda genius!
1032  [Fast] Hold up, hold up—if she's from the future then how did she—actually, y'know what, I don't even care anymore. [Groan]
1033  [Disappointed] The whole thing was a dream? [Angry] I wasted forty hours of my life for "it was all a dream"?
1034  [Slow] I'm gonna need to, like, rewatch everything now because this changes literally every single interaction they had. [Tsk]
1035  [Sarcastic] Oh great, another secret twin plot twist. [Chuckle] What's next, evil clones?
1036  [Whisper] Did anyone else see that coming or am I just really, really bad at picking up clues? [Sad]
1037  [Happy] YES! I KNEW IT! [Shout] My theory was right and everyone said I was reading too much into things! [Laugh]
1038  [Fast] Okay but wait—if he knew all along then why didn't he just—ugh, this makes no sense whatsoever. [Disappointed]
1039  [Angry] They brought her back from the dead? [Sigh] Death means absolutely nothing in this show anymore, does it?
1040  [Slow] That's... actually heartbreaking when you think about it. [Sad] He basically sacrificed everything for nothing.
1041  [Chuckle] The narrator was unreliable this whole time and I fell for it like a complete idiot. [Happy] Honestly, respect.
1042  [Whisper] So the good guys were actually—I mean, they weren't really the good guys at all, were they? [Slow] Kinda makes you think.
1043  [frustrated] Oh my God, you should have seen this morning. So you know how Sarah's been planning this wedding for like two years? Every detail perfect, outdoor ceremony, the whole thing. And I wake up and it's just— [sigh] it's pouring. Like absolutely dumping rain. [stressed] And Sarah is, she's just losing it, right? Like completely falling apart. The tent's not gonna fit everyone, half the decorations are gonna be ruined, and I'm trying to be supportive but honestly I'm thinking this is gonna be a disaster. Like a total, soggy disaster. [annoyed] The flowers are all droopy, people are showing up with umbrellas and wet shoes, and I'm just— I'm standing there in my heels getting soaked thinking this poor girl, you know? This is supposed to be her perfect day and it's just... [quieter] [realizing] But then— okay wait, so they're doing the ceremony and I actually look around for the first time instead of just complaining in my head about my wet dress, and... [amazed] [warm] It was like— it was magical. The rain on the tent sounded like this soft drumming, and all the string lights were reflecting in the puddles, and everyone looked so cozy and intimate under the tent. Like we were all sharing this beautiful secret moment. [soft] [emotional] Sarah looked radiant. Absolutely radiant. Sometimes the imperfect moments are the most perfect ones, you know?
1044  Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's incredible! I mean, finally, right? They've been making you wait forever for this.
1045  Senior analyst! Okay okay, we're definitely—we're celebrating this weekend, no arguments. How do you feel though? Like, honestly?
1046  Fine? You're gonna give me "fine"? [Laugh] Come on, this is huge! Did they like, did they tell you why now? What changed?
1047  Oh. Oh wait, so it's not—I mean, it's still good though, right? Like regardless of why, you're moving up and that's... that's what matters?
1048  You don't sound—okay, what's really going on? Because like, I dunno, most people would be kinda more excited about a promotion? [Sigh] Talk to me.
1049  Ah. Yeah, no no no, I get it now. It's like—you wanted out, not up, right? That's totally valid, honestly.
1050  Have you been—actually wait, have you been applying other places? Because I remember you were gonna update your resume like, what, two months ago?
1051  Right, of course not. They work you like—ugh, it's ridiculous. But okay, real talk though, is the money at least good? Like significantly better?
1052  Twenty percent is—that's actually really solid! You could like, you could save that extra and then figure out your next move without the pressure, y'know? [Chuckle] Silver lining?
1053  Good. That's—that's smart. And hey, "Senior Analyst" looks pretty great on that resume you're definitely gonna update soon, right? I'm just saying.
1054  Wait, what? I—okay, I know how that sounds but it wasn't like I meant to tell anyone. We were all at lunch and Mark was going on about his interview and it just... slipped out.
1055  Yeah, it did. I'm not gonna stand here and lie to you. But come on, you know I didn't wake up this morning planning to spill your business to the whole office.
1056  Okay okay, I get that you're pissed. [Sigh] But honestly? You're acting like I did this to sabotage you or something. It was literally just a stupid mistake—I was trying to relate to Mark's situation and I—
1057  I know that! God, I know that. But you're being kinda unfair here. Like, I've had your back for three years, covered for you a million times, and one screw-up means I'm suddenly the worst friend ever?
1058  No, it wasn't, you're right. But I mean—look look, I'm sorry it happened, okay? I am. But I'm also getting a little frustrated that you won't even [scoff] let me explain or anything. Just standing there all cold and judgy.
1059  That's—wow, that's really reductive. You know what? Fine. Be mad. But don't pretend like you've never accidentally said something you shouldn't have. Remember when you told Jake about my thing with HR?
1060  How? How was it different? Because it was you? Look, I'm trying to apologize here but I'm not gonna grovel when you're being this—I dunno, this sanctimonious about it.
1061  And I didn't mean to! Jesus, how many times do I have to—[frustrated laugh] You know what? I messed up. Fine fine, I own that. But you standing there acting like I'm not even worth talking to? That hurts too, y'know?
1062  Okay, that's—that's actually pretty harsh. I said something by accident in a conversation. You're deliberately trying to make me feel like garbage right now. There's a difference.
1063  Yeah, there is. And if you can't see that, then maybe—I dunno, maybe we've got bigger problems than me accidentally mentioning your promotion thing. Because friends are supposed to at least try to understand each other, not just... whatever this is.
1064  Oh—oh no, that's never good. Um, did I do something? Wait, obviously I did something or you wouldn't be—sorry, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.
1065  No no no, please don't—don't do that. Just tell me what's wrong. I can't fix it if I don't know what I did, right? And I really wanna fix whatever this is because you seem really upset.
1066  You are! You totally are, and I'm so grateful for that, like you have no idea how much—wait. [nervous laugh] Is this about me being needy? Because I know I can be a lot sometimes.
1067  I—that's not—I do ask! Don't I? Oh god, I don't, do I? I mean, I think about it all the time but maybe I just—maybe I never actually say it out loud? Shit.
1068  I know, I know, it's been a really bad week and you've been—you've been amazing, honestly. But hold on, are you saying I never check on you? Because that can't be right. Can it? [groan] Oh my god, it is.
1069  You—what? When? Why didn't you tell me? I would've—actually no, that's literally the whole point, isn't it? You shouldn't have to tell me. I should've just known to ask.
1070  Oh god. Oh god, I did. I was freaking out about whether oat milk was pretentious and you were—you were having a panic attack? I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? Like genuinely the absolute worst.
1071  I'm so—I'm so sorry. That's not even enough but I don't know what else to say. You're always taking care of me and I just—I get so wrapped up in my own head that I forget other people have stuff too, y'know?
1072  No, you're right to be mad. Like, completely right. I've been treating you like my personal therapist instead of my friend and that's—that's really messed up. [sigh] I wanna do better. I need to do better. Will you let me try?
1073  I know. God, of course you are. Can I—would it be okay if I listened this time? Like actually listened? No interrupting, no making it about me, just... how are you doing? For real?
1074  [drowsy] Okay, so, um, coffee time. Just gonna— just gonna make my usual morning, uh, my usual morning cup and then I can, like, actually function like a human being. [yawn] Where's the, um— where's the coffee? [slightly more alert] Hm. That's... that's weird. I could've sworn there was, like, at least half a bag left? Maybe it's, um, maybe it's behind the— no, that's just the sugar. And the, uh, the tea that I never drink but keep buying for some reason. [realization dawning] Oh. Oh no. No no no, this is— this is not happening right now. I'm out. I'm actually out of coffee. On a Monday. [groan] Of course it's a Monday, because why would I run out of coffee on, like, a Saturday when I could actually go to the store without wanting to, um, to crawl back into bed? [slightly frantic] Okay, think think think. Do I have any of those instant packets? The ones that taste like, uh, like sadness and regret but technically contain caffeine? Let me just— [tsk] no, I used the last one during that, um, that late night last week when I was— [resigned but problem-solving] Right. So. Options. I can either go to the store looking like I got hit by a truck, or I can, um, I can just accept that today is gonna be one of those days where I move really, really slowly until I find caffeine somewhere. [sigh] Maybe the corner place is open? They're usually— yeah, okay, pants first, then coffee mission.
1075  [nervously] Oh, hi Mr. Davidson! [higher pitch] I was just finishing up the quarterly reports. [clearing throat] Did you need something before I head out? I'm happy to stay a bit longer if there's anything urgent that needs attention today.
1076  [strained cheerfulness] The whole weekend? [nervous laugh] Sure, I mean, I did have some plans but... [trailing off] work comes first, right? I'll just reschedule my sister's birthday dinner. She'll understand that these things happen sometimes in our industry.
1077  [hesitant] Pop more, absolutely. [forced enthusiasm] I'll add some animations and maybe restructure the whole flow? [quieter] Though I should mention my laptop's been crashing lately. But I'm sure it'll hold up through the weekend work sessions somehow.
1078  [exhausted whisper] Right, dedication. [trying to sound upbeat] I'll grab my sleeping bag—kidding! [hollow laugh] Though I basically live here anyway, don't I? My plants at home are probably wondering if I've abandoned them permanently at this point.
1079  [voice cracking] Two hundred pages? [Deep breath] Of course, Mr. Davidson, happy to help. [mumbling quickly] I love learning opportunities, especially ones that consume my entire existence and leave me questioning my life choices while eating vending machine dinners alone.
1080  [defeated] Every few hours, got it. [sarcastic undertone] I'll make sure to time my mental breakdowns between your updates. [perking up falsely] Actually, would you prefer hourly updates instead? I want to make sure you're fully informed throughout the process.
1081  [barely audible] Fifty slides. [hysterical giggle] Why not make it a hundred while we're at it? [getting louder] I mean, I'm already sacrificing my weekend, my sanity, and my vitamin D levels for this wonderful opportunity to excel!
1082  [voice breaking] Next weekend too? [shaky laugh] Mr. Davidson, you're so funny! [desperately cheerful] I actually love that my calendar is just work, work, work, and more work. Who needs a personal life when spreadsheets love you unconditionally, right?
1083  [high-pitched] Train the intern! [Nervous giggle] From here! While doing everything else! [frantically upbeat] Absolutely, I'm basically a superhuman multitasking machine who doesn't need sleep, food, or basic human connection to function at peak performance levels!
1084  [deliriously happy] Six AM meeting after my weekend here! [manic giggle] I'll get the fancy Colombian roast that costs my hourly wage! [sing-song voice] Because nothing says "valued employee" like being a barista-analyst-designer-trainer hybrid who never leaves the building!
1085  Congratulations on your win, sir. Let me pull up your file here... Yes, I see your claim for the $2.8 million prize from October 15th at the Riverside Avenue location.
1086  [patiently] Sir, the $2.8 million represents the annuity value over 29 years. Your lump sum cash option, which you selected, comes to $1,680,000 before federal withholding of 24% and state taxes of 8.82%.
1087  I understand your frustration, Mr... Thompson, is it? The withholdings are automatic—we're required by law to send $403,200 directly to the IRS and $148,176 to the state revenue department.
1088  The withholdings were processed when you claimed your prize on October 22nd. However, depending on your total income and deductions, you might receive some back when filing your 2024 tax return. Have you spoken with a tax professional yet?
1089  Absolutely, I can email you Form W-2G and the withholding statements to... Is your email still robert.thompson.1975@email.com? You should receive those documents within 24 hours, reference number LC-2024-10-8847 for your records.
1090  Sir, you're still receiving over one million dollars after taxes. That's a life-changing amount of money, even if it's not the full advertised jackpot. Many winners find financial planning services helpful for managing their windfall responsibly.
1091  That's a common reaction, Mr. Thompson. If it helps, you can reduce next year's tax burden by making charitable contributions or maxing out retirement contributions to your 401k—[pause] the limit for 2024 is $23,000, or $30,500 if you're over 50.
1092  [encouragingly] Exactly, and if your spouse works, she can contribute the same amount to her plan. [helpfully] Between that and mortgage interest deductions on your Riverside property, [pause] you might see a significant refund when you file.
1093  No more surprises from our end—everything's been processed. Your net payout of $1,128,624 was direct deposited to your Chase account ending in 7792 on October 24th. [pause] The funds should have cleared by now.
1094  That's wonderful perspective, Mr. Thompson. Enjoy your winnings, and don't forget—that documentation with reference number LC-2024-10-8847 will arrive shortly. Congratulations again, and thank you for calling the State Lottery Commission!
1095  Mr. Harrison, I understand your frustration about the lack of updates. We've been, um, experiencing some internal delays with case reviews lately. Let me pull up your file right now to see exactly where things stand.
1096  [calmly] You're absolutely right to be upset. The partner assigned to your case should have contacted you weeks ago. I'm escalating this immediately to our managing attorney, and you'll hear from someone within twenty-four hours, guaranteed.
1097  Sir, I can assure you we do communicate, but clearly something fell through the cracks with your case. I'm personally taking ownership of this—not passing it off—and will follow up myself tomorrow morning.
1098  Yes, I can see here that your documents were reviewed on... October 15th. The analysis is actually complete; it just hasn't been communicated to you, which is unacceptable on our part.
1099  [embarrassed] I genuinely don't have a good answer for that. What I can do is email you the preliminary findings right now—this minute—while we're on the phone. Then schedule a proper consultation for tomorrow to discuss strategy.
1100  I'm sending you a calendar invite right now with a written commitment. If the attorney doesn't show, you'll receive a fifty percent discount on your next invoice. That's how serious I am about fixing this.
1101  [understanding] That's completely fair, Mr. Harrison. The documents should be hitting your inbox in about thirty seconds. We value your business, and I'm sorry we've failed to show that until now.
1102  You'll be meeting with Jennifer Walsh, our senior tax attorney. She literally wrote the book on IRS negotiations—well, a book anyway. She's already reviewing your case as we speak.
1103  Two PM sharp, and she's blocking ninety minutes just for you. I've also added myself as a backup contact, so if anything changes—which it won't—you'll know immediately. We're getting this back on track.
1104  No apology necessary—you had every right to be upset. We dropped the ball, plain and simple. Tomorrow at two, Jennifer will have a complete action plan ready for your review.
1105  [Slow] Every single time I've ignored that little voice in my head, I've, um, I've regretted it. [Sigh] Every time.
1106  [Happy] Look, my gut literally saved me from taking that job—turns out the company went under like three months later! [Laugh]
1107  [Fast] [Angry] People keep telling me I need "evidence" and "logic" but y'know what? My instincts have never—and I mean never—been wrong about someone being sketchy.
1108  [Whisper] It's kinda hard to explain, but I just... I feel things before they happen sometimes. [Slow] Like this weird energy shift, you know?
1109  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, I should totally ignore millions of years of evolution that gave us these survival instincts—what could possibly go wrong? [Tsk]
1110  [Disappointed] I used to second-guess myself constantly, but then I realized—wait, why am I trusting everyone else more than myself? [Sigh]
1111  My body literally tenses up when something's off—like, uh, like right now actually, and I'm gonna listen to it.
1112  [Shout] That feeling in my stomach has saved my life before! [Fast] I'm not being dramatic—I mean literally saved my life!
1113  [Sad] [Slow] The one time I didn't trust myself was when... when I lost everything that mattered, so yeah.
1114  [Chuckle] Call it whatever you want—intuition, sixth sense, spidey sense—but mine's basically never let me down.
1115  [Fast] Okay so basically our brains process like thousands of tiny details we don't even consciously notice, right? [Happy] That's what instincts are!
1116  [Angry] [Groan] I'm so tired of people telling me I'm being "irrational" when my gut feelings keep being proven right!
1117  You ever just walk into a room and immediately know you gotta get out? [Whisper] That's happened to me twice, and both times—yeah.
1118  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let me just ignore this screaming alarm bell in my head because someone else thinks they know better.
1119  [Disappointed] I dunno, maybe I'm weird, but I can literally feel when someone's lying to me—it's like this, this buzzing sensation. [Tsk]
1120  [Happy] [Fast] My therapist actually told me that trusting your instincts is, like, super important for mental health—so I'm totally validated here!
1121  [Sad] After what happened with my ex, I promised myself I'd never—absolutely never—ignore those red flag feelings again. [Sigh]
1122  [Shout] Why would I not trust the thing that's kept humans alive for thousands of years? [Laugh] [Fast] That's just basic survival, people!
1123  Honestly? [Slow] [Whisper] Sometimes I know things I shouldn't know, and I've just... I've learned to accept that and go with it.
1124  [Chuckle] My mom always said I had "the gift"—which sounds dramatic but, um, she wasn't wrong about my track record here.
1125  [casual] So I'm lying in bed this morning, just scrolling through my phone, you know? And I notice this little dark spot on my ceiling. Like, right above where I sleep. [matter-of-fact] At first I'm thinking it's just— I don't know, a stain or something. Maybe from when it rained last week and there was that leak upstairs. [light sigh] Nothing major. [slightly curious] But then I'm looking at it more, because it's kind of an weird shape, you know? Not really like a water stain. More... I don't know, clustered? Like little dots all grouped together. [concerned] So I get up to look closer, and— wait. Wait, that's... [pause] that's not a stain. One of those dots just— did that just move? [alarmed] Oh my god, they're moving. They're all moving. Those aren't spots, those are— [sharp exhale] those are bugs. There are bugs on my ceiling. Like, a lot of bugs. [horrified] And now that I'm really looking, it's not just that one spot. There's another cluster over there, and there, and— [whimper] oh no, oh no, they're everywhere. [panicking] The whole ceiling is covered! How did I not see this before? I've been sleeping under this for— [groan] how long have they been up there? Watching me sleep? [frantic] I can't— I need to call someone. An exterminator, the landlord, I don't know! [defeated whimper] I'm never sleeping again.
1126  I—okay, yes, technically I knew, but I didn't think he'd actually show up? Like, he said maybe, and you know how he is with maybes, they're usually nos, so I just assumed—
1127  Wait wait wait, that came out wrong. I mean, I should've told you, obviously I should've told you. I just—everything happened so fast and then we were already there and I kept trying to find the right moment to pull you aside but—[nervous laugh] god, I'm making this worse, aren't I?
1128  I know. I know, and that was—that was horrible. I saw your face when you walked in and I just... I wanted to die, honestly. Like literally wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole because I realized how badly I'd messed up.
1129  No no no, not three weeks—okay, maybe like... two and a half? But I didn't know know, y'know? People were just talking and I didn't wanna spread rumors or make you upset over nothing if it wasn't even true—
1130  That's not—[sigh] okay, yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I did. I thought I was protecting you but I wasn't, I was just... being a coward, I guess. I didn't wanna be the one to tell you because I knew it would hurt and I just—I'm so sorry.
1131  No! No, you didn't, I promise you didn't. Everyone was on your side, literally everyone thought he was being a complete ass for bringing her there. And honestly? You handled it way better than I would've—I would've probably cried or thrown something or both.
1132  Would've been justified, honestly. Like completely, one hundred percent justified. [groan] I should've—as soon as I heard he might be there, I should've texted you. Or called. Or literally sent a carrier pigeon, anything except just... hoping it would work out somehow.
1133  I know. And I—I do have your back, I swear I do, I just... I handled this completely wrong. Like catastrophically wrong. I kept telling myself I was waiting for the right time but really I was just—I dunno, scared? Which is such a stupid excuse because you're my best friend and you deserved to know.
1134  Can I—can I make it up to you? Somehow? I mean, I know I can't undo it, but... maybe we could go get terrible ice cream and plot revenge or something? I'll even let you pick the most embarrassing photo of me to post if you want. The one from Halloween with the—y'know.
1135  [nervous laugh] Oh god, yeah, even that one. I mean, I'll hate it, but I kinda deserve some public humiliation right now. Just—please don't stay mad forever? I really am sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply, groveling-on-my-knees sorry.
1136  Oh! Um, okay—wait, is this about last night? Because I can explain, I really didn't mean to—I know I was being kinda pushy but I just thought you two would be so perfect together, y'know?
1137  No no no, you're right, I'm sorry. I just—I get excited sometimes and I don't think about how it might make you feel. [nervous laugh] Which is like, really selfish of me, I know.
1138  I know! God, I know, and I—honestly I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time? That's not an excuse though, I'm not trying to make excuses. I just genuinely think you'd be happy if you gave him a chance—sorry! Sorry, I'm doing it again.
1139  You did. You absolutely did, and I just—I kept ignoring that, didn't I? [sigh] I'm like one of those awful people who thinks they know better than everyone else about their own lives.
1140  Okay, I deserve that. Totally deserve that. I've been treating you like you don't know what you want, which is so—that's so disrespectful, oh my god. I'm literally the worst friend.
1141  You're right, you're—you're completely right. I've been making everything about my little matchmaking project instead of just, like, enjoying time with you? That's messed up. That's really, really messed up of me.
1142  Wait, really? Oh god, I—[groan] I didn't realize it was that bad. I mean, obviously it was bad, but I didn't know I was actually pushing you away. That's like, the opposite of what I wanted.
1143  I dunno, I guess I just—I wanted you to be happy? You've been kinda down lately and I thought maybe—but that's so stupid, right? Like dating someone isn't gonna magically fix everything. And you never even asked for my help.
1144  I'm gonna stop. Like, completely stop, I promise. No more bringing up Ryan, no more "accidental" run-ins, no more—god, I've been so annoying, haven't I? I'm surprised you didn't tell me off sooner. [quieter] I'm really, truly sorry.
1145  You have me. You—you always had me, I just got way too caught up in this stupid idea and I... yeah. I'm done with it. Completely done. Can we maybe, um, start over? Like just be normal friends who don't make everything about some guy you're not even interested in?
1146  Oh god, okay—I can explain. I didn't tell everyone, I swear, it was just—I mentioned it to like two people and then somehow it just... spread? I dunno how it happened.
1147  I know, I know! And I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. It just kinda slipped out when we were talking about the whole job thing and I wasn't thinking—wait no, that's not an excuse. [nervous laugh] There is no excuse.
1148  Oh no. Oh no no no, that's—okay that's really bad. I didn't think it would—I mean, how did she even—? Actually, doesn't matter. This is my fault. Completely, totally my fault.
1149  You trusted me with something really personal and I just—I blew it. Like, spectacularly. I've been trying to figure out why I even opened my mouth and honestly? [sigh] I think I was just trying to make conversation and I'm an idiot who doesn't think before speaking.
1150  No! No, it's not. I'm not—I'm not trying to make excuses, I'm just... I wanna be honest with you, y'know? About how badly I screwed up. Because I did. I really, really did.
1151  I know. And now I've made it like a thousand times worse and I just—god, I hate myself for this. You were already going through so much and I just piled on more crap. That's not—that's not what friends do.
1152  Is there any way I can—wait, that's stupid, I can't undo it. But like, going forward? What do you need from me? Space? Should I try to do damage control? I'll literally do whatever you want. [groan] I just wanna fix this somehow.
1153  You're right. You're totally right. I just—I keep thinking about how you must've felt when people started asking you about it and I... I feel sick about it, honestly. Like physically sick.
1154  I deserve that. I do. Um, for what it's worth—which is probably nothing right now—but you're gonna bounce back from this, y'know? The job thing, I mean. You're literally the smartest, most capable person I know and this one thing doesn't—doesn't define you.
1155  I won't. I swear I won't. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna work really hard to earn your trust back, if you'll let me. However long it takes. Because you mean... you mean everything to me and I'm so, so sorry I hurt you.
1156  I—okay, yeah, I know how it looks. But it's not that I didn't trust you, I swear, it's just—I didn't know how to bring it up? Like every time I tried to tell you, something would come up or I'd just... chicken out.
1157  No no no, wait—please don't do that. Don't shut down on me. I wanted to tell you so many times, honestly, but it got harder the longer I waited and then—[nervous laugh] then it became this whole thing where I'd waited too long, y'know?
1158  Oh god. Oh god, she told you? I specifically asked her not to—okay, that's not the point. You're right, you shouldn't have found out that way. That's... that's literally the worst way you could've found out.
1159  No! No, absolutely not. Just my parents and—um, well, my therapist, obviously. But that's it. I didn't tell anyone else, I promise. You're actually the person I wanted to tell most, I just... I dunno, I kept messing it up.
1160  That's not—[sigh] okay, I see how it sounds. But the anxiety stuff, it got really bad, like really really bad, and I needed professional help. It wasn't about not trusting you, it was about me being a complete mess and not wanting to burden you with it.
1161  I know I know, that's stupid, but you were dealing with your job stuff and your dad's surgery and I just—I thought I was protecting you? Which sounds so dumb now that I'm saying it out loud. God, I'm such an idiot.
1162  I deserve that. I really—I really messed this up, didn't I? Like, we've been friends for eight years and I just... I got so stuck in my own head about it. I kept thinking I was doing the right thing by handling it myself but I wasn't. [quieter] I really wasn't.
1163  No, that's—that's not what I thought at all. I knew you could handle it, of course you could, you're literally the strongest person I know. I was the one who couldn't handle telling you. I was scared you'd—I dunno, worry too much? Try to fix everything? And I already felt so broken.
1164  You're right. You're completely right and I'm—god, I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, deeply sorry. I should've trusted you with this, I should've let you in instead of just... shutting down and pretending everything was fine. That wasn't fair to you. To us.
1165  Yeah, I am. The meds are helping and therapy is—it's good, actually. Really good. And I wanna—if you're willing, I wanna be honest with you about all of it now. No more hiding stuff, I promise. I just... I really need my best friend back. [pause] If you'll still have me.
1166  [muttering] Okay, so, um, serving size is— let me just— [sigh] why is this so tiny? Like, servings per container... two and a half? Two and a half servings in this little, uh, this little bag of chips that I could literally finish in like five minutes. [slightly exasperated] So wait, if there's, um, if there's 150 calories per serving, and there's two and a half servings, then that's— that's what, like 375 calories total? For this tiny— [huh] that seems like a lot for something this small. [slower, working it out] But okay, so if I eat, like, half the bag, that would be... one and a quarter servings? So that's, um, 150 times— no wait, that's not— [tsk] why can't I just do math in my head anymore? [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna eat some chips and not think about it too hard. Like, it's not that serious, right? It's just— it's just a snack. [trailing off] Although I guess I should probably... I mean, if I'm trying to—
1167  [breathless] I can't—I can't believe the soap actually melted through! [hysterical giggling] Three months of collecting bars from the commissary, [louder] and it WORKED! The drain cover just... dissolved like butter!
1168  [whispered excitement] We're actually out. [building volume] We're standing in a field, Marcus! [explosive laughter] Not concrete, not bars—GRASS! I haven't touched grass in four years!
1169  [shrieking] The warden's toupee! [more controlled] Remember when it flew off during inspection? [snorting laugh] That's when I knew—if he couldn't keep his hair on, he couldn't keep us in!
1170  [mock serious] "Inmates Johnson and Marcus, report for morning count." [breaking into laughter] They're counting empty beds right now! [gleeful shout] By tomorrow we'll be in Mexico eating tacos!
1171  [choked up] We did it, man. [stronger] After all their "maximum security" talk, their cameras, their dogs. [triumphant laugh] Two guys with soap and spoons beat their million-dollar system!
1172  [hushed urgency] Wait, wait—do you hear that? [relieved exhale] Just a rabbit! [hysterical] I thought it was bloodhounds! A rabbit! I'm scared of woodland creatures now!
1173  [philosophical tone] You know what's crazy? [speeding up excitedly] We complained about the meatloaf every Tuesday for three years. [wistful laugh] I'd kill for that garbage meatloaf right now!
1174  [shaky whisper] My legs are jello. [getting stronger] Adrenaline's wearing off and I can barely stand. [giddy laughter] But I'd crawl to Canada if it meant staying free!
1175  [muttering] Okay, so it's, um— it's Sarah's birthday today and I should, uh, I should probably reach out. But do I text or do I call? I mean, texting is easier, right? Just a quick "happy birthday" with maybe, like, a little cake emoji or something. [thoughtful] But then again, calling is more, um, more personal? Like, it shows I actually, uh, I actually took the time to— to dial her number and have a real conversation. Which is nice. That's a nice thing to do. [slightly anxious] Except what if she's, like, what if she's busy? What if I call and she's in the middle of something and then I'm just— I'm just interrupting her birthday with my awkward phone voice. [nervous laugh] God, I hate my phone voice. [faster] Okay, but texting feels so— so impersonal, you know? Like I'm just checking her off a list. "Happy birthday Sarah, check, done." That's not— that's not very thoughtful. [decisive, then wavering] Calling. I should call. That's what friends do, they call each other on birthdays and have actual conversations about— [trailing off, uncertain] Unless... unless everyone texts now and calling is weird?
1176  [casual] So I was at the grocery store earlier, and I'm in line behind this woman who's having trouble with her card reader, you know? And the cashier's being super patient, walking her through it step by step. [conversational] And I'm just standing there thinking, like, oh that's sweet, she's probably not great with technology. I figured she was maybe, I don't know, seventy-something? Just based on, you know, the whole vibe. [a bit awkward] So when she finally gets it working, I make some casual comment to the cashier about how nice it was that she helped out. And the cashier goes, "Oh yeah, she's actually only fifty-two, she just started a new medication that makes her a bit foggy." [realizing] [slight panic] Wait. Fifty-two? I— [nervous laugh] Oh no. I definitely... I definitely treated her like she was ancient. I was doing that thing where you talk a little louder and slower? [mortified] Oh my god, I probably came across like such a condescending jerk! [groan] She was probably thinking, "Why is this person talking to me like I'm decrepit?" [spiraling] [horrified] I literally aged her by twenty years in my head and then acted accordingly! [whimper] What is wrong with me? I'm never making assumptions about anyone ever again. Ugh!
1177  [casual] Oh, you know what's funny? I was cleaning out my bag earlier and I found this receipt from when I borrowed Jake's car charger a while back. [light laugh] You remember, that day my phone died right before I had to drive to that interview? [conversational] I think I returned it though. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I did. I mean, I would have, right? That's like, basic borrowing etiquette. [slight uncertainty] Actually, wait... when did I give it back to him? [pause] Hmm. I remember using it, obviously, and I remember being super grateful, but the actual returning part is... [trails off] kind of fuzzy? [growing concern] Oh no. [nervous laugh] When was that interview again? That was... that was back in March, wasn't it? [sharp exhale] It's June now. Oh god. [increasingly worried] I don't think I returned it. I— [groan] I definitely didn't return it. It's probably still in my glove compartment! Jake probably thinks I'm this terrible person who just steals car chargers! [spiraling] Three months! I've had his charger for three months and he's been too polite to ask for it back! [frustrated laugh] What kind of friend am I? He probably had to buy a new one! [mortified] [frantic] Oh my god, I'm the worst borrower alive. I'm never living this down. [whimper] How do I even bring this up now?
1178  [frustrated] [agitated] Okay so I'm already running late this morning, right? And I swing by that coffee place on Fifth—you know the one—and I mobile order like I always do. Oat milk latte, extra shot, the usual. [annoyed] So I get there and they hand me this drink and it's like— it's regular milk, no extra shot, just completely wrong. And I'm like, seriously? [scoff] Like how hard is it to read an order? [getting more worked up] So I'm standing there being like "excuse me, this isn't what I ordered," and the barista is giving me this look like I'm the problem. And she's like "well that's what the app says" and I'm like— ugh, no, that's not what I ordered, I order the same thing every day. [irritated] She pulls out her little tablet thing to show me and I'm about to just lose it because I know what I— wait, hold on. [pause] [quieter] Oh. Oh no. [embarrassed] [deflated] Um, so... I'm looking at the screen and it's— yeah, it's exactly what she made. Like I apparently hit regular milk instead of oat milk and forgot to add the extra shot. [sheepish] [half laugh] God, I was so mean to that poor girl. I'm definitely going back there with a tip later because wow, I was— yeah, I was completely wrong. [groan] I felt like such an ass.
1179  [casual] Oh yeah, and I need to take Milo to the vet soon. He's due for his rabies shot or something. You know how it is with all those pet vaccines. [conversational] Actually, let me check when that's supposed to be. [pause] I think it was like... sometime this month? I usually write it down but I can't remember if I did. [a bit concerned] Hmm, okay, so I'm looking at his vaccine record and... [pause] wait. Wait, this says his rabies was due in... March? That can't be right. [growing worried] Oh no. Oh no no no. It's July. It's literally July and his rabies vaccine was due in March. How did I— [groan] how did I miss this by four months? [panicking] What kind of dog mom am I? Four months! He could get rabies! He could get sick! What if he bites someone and he's not vaccinated? Oh my god, what if they take him away? [spiraling] [voice getting higher] I had one job! Feed him, love him, keep his shots up to date! And I can't even— [sharp exhale] I can't even manage a calendar reminder! [frantic] [near tears] He probably thinks I don't care about him! My poor baby! What if something happens to him because I'm the worst pet parent in the world? [whimper] I'm calling the vet right now!
1180  [frustrated] So Jake totally bailed on me today and I'm just— ugh, I'm so annoyed right now. Like we had plans to go see that movie, the one that's only playing for like two more days? And he texts me literally twenty minutes before we're supposed to meet up. [irritated] Twenty minutes! Like what am I supposed to do with that? I already drove halfway there, I'm sitting in this parking lot like an idiot. [scoff] And his excuse is just "something came up" — like what does that even mean? [building anger] I swear he does this all the time, like he thinks my time doesn't matter or something. I could've stayed home, I could've done laundry, I could've— I don't know, literally anything else instead of getting dressed and driving out here for nothing. [surprised] Oh wait, he's— he's texting me again. Hold on, let me just... [confused] [hopeful] Wait, what? He says he's actually on his way now? Like he's in his car, he'll be here in five minutes. Something about his sister needing help moving something but now his dad's handling it? [relieved] [slightly embarrassed] Oh. Okay so we can still catch the seven-thirty showing. [half laugh] God, I was ready to like write him off as the worst friend ever. I guess I should probably not murder him when he gets here, huh?
1181  [frustrated] Oh my God, I am so mad at Jessica right now. Like, I cannot believe she just— she just blurted it out like that, you know? We've been planning this surprise party for Alex for like three weeks, and she just goes and tells him about it at lunch today. [angry] I was like, "Jessica, what the hell?" And she's all like "Oh, I thought he already knew" — how would he already know? It's a surprise! [scoff] That's literally the whole point. [irritated] So now I have to text everyone and be like, "Hey, the surprise is ruined, maybe we just do dinner instead?" Which is so lame compared to what we had planned. We got the decorations, we booked the whole back room at— [confused] Wait, Alex is... he's texting me right now. Um, he says "Thanks for keeping the secret about the real party." What? "Keeping the secret about the real party?" [realization dawning] Oh. Oh my God. [half laugh] Jessica was... she was telling him about a fake surprise? Wait, so there's still— there's still the actual surprise happening? [embarrassed] [amused] I just spent like two hours being furious at her and she was actually, like, being a genius. She made up a decoy surprise so he'd think it was ruined. [chuckle] God, I feel like such an idiot right now.
1182  [frustrated] Okay so you know that package I ordered like two weeks ago? The one with my— with the skincare stuff and those boots I showed you? It was supposed to be here Monday, then Tuesday, now it's Thursday and still nothing. [annoyed] And I keep getting these like useless updates, "Your package is on the way!" Like okay, where? Where is it on the way to, because it's not here. I literally took a half day yesterday because they said it would be delivered by noon and I didn't want it sitting on my— [irritated] [getting worked up] Like I paid for the faster shipping too, which was not cheap, and now they're just— I don't know where my stuff is and customer service keeps giving me the same copy-paste responses about "unforeseen delays" and— [surprised] Oh wait, hold on. Someone's at my door right now, I can hear— let me just— [amazed] [half laugh] You have got to be kidding me. It's literally the delivery guy. Right now. As I'm complaining about it to you. [sheepish] [chuckling] Okay well, um, never mind I guess? [laugh] The universe was apparently listening to me whine and decided to shut me up. [warm] [slightly embarrassed] I should probably go sign for this before he leaves. But wow, talk about timing, right?
1183  [muttering] Oh, come on, really? Uh, battery's at like— what is that, fifteen percent? I just, um, I just plugged this thing in yesterday, didn't I? Or was that— no, wait, that was my phone. [sigh] Okay, so where did I— where did I put the charger? [slightly annoyed] It's not by the couch, it's not on the, uh, on the kitchen counter. I mean, how does a laptop charger just, like, disappear? It's not exactly small, right? It's got that whole, um, that whole brick thing going on. [thinking out loud] Wait wait wait, did I leave it at— no, I haven't been anywhere. Unless it's still in my bag? But I don't think I— [tsk] let me just check the bedroom. Maybe I was, um, maybe I was working in there and just left it plugged in by the nightstand or something. [brighter] Oh! There it is. Under the bed, somehow. How did it even— [laugh] okay, whatever, crisis averted. Just gotta, um, just gotta remember where I put things, apparently. [resigned] Twelve percent now. Cool. This is, uh, this is gonna be one of those days, isn't it?
1184  [muttering] Okay, so, um, how long has it been now? Like, twenty minutes? Thirty? I should've, uh, I should've checked the time when I finished that last coat, but I was just so— I was so focused on getting those, um, those corner bits right. [slightly impatient] The can says, what, two hours? But that's like, that's for full cure, right? Or is that— is that just touch dry? [sigh] I can never remember the difference between, um, between touch dry and actually dry dry. [contemplative] I mean, it looks dry. It looks pretty dry from here, but I'm not gonna— I'm not gonna risk it and then have, like, finger prints all over the, uh, the trim work. That would be so— [groan] that would just be typical. [slightly restless] Maybe I should just, um, should just do something else for a bit? But then I'll forget about it and it'll be, like, tomorrow morning and I'll be like "oh right, the paint." Which is— which is fine, I guess, but— [resigned] You know what? I'll just... I'll just wait. Better safe than, um, than having to do touch-ups later, right?
1185  [muttering] Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, twenty minutes? Thirty? I feel like it's been— it's been forever, but it's probably, uh, probably not even close to done yet. [slightly impatient] These things always take, what, like an hour? Maybe more? I should've, um, I should've checked the timer when I started it, but I was just— I was in a rush to get it going and now I'm just, uh, just standing here like an idiot. [conversational] I mean, I could go do something else, right? Like, I don't have to just— just hover around the laundry room like some kind of, um, some kind of dryer stalker. [laugh] That's weird. That's a weird thing to say. [second-guessing] But what if it's almost done and I miss it? Then my clothes are just gonna sit there getting all wrinkled and— and I hate ironing. I really, really hate ironing. [listening intently] Wait, is it— is it slowing down? It sounds different. Or maybe I'm just, uh, maybe I'm just imagining things because I want it to be done. [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm gonna go make some coffee and check back in like fifteen minutes. Yeah. That's, um, that's the adult thing to do here.
1186  [confused, sniffing] Okay, what is— what is that smell? That's, um, that's definitely not normal. It's like, I don't know, it's not bad exactly, but it's just... [inhale] weird? Like, um, like if you mixed vanilla with, uh, with something musty maybe? [muttering, moving around] Is it coming from the kitchen? I mean, I didn't cook anything weird today, just— just the usual stuff. But maybe something went bad in the, um, in the fridge? [sniff] No, no that's not it. It's not that kind of smell. [slightly puzzled] Wait, is it— is it coming from upstairs? [pause] Huh. It's like, it's following me around, which is, um, which is either really concerning or I'm just, uh, I'm just being paranoid about it now. [realization creeping in] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [sniff sniff] Is this my sweater? Did I, um— [laugh] oh my god, did I grab the wrong fabric softener or something? That would be so— [relieved, slightly embarrassed] Yep. Yep, it's definitely the sweater. Mystery solved. I'm just, uh, I'm just wearing weird-smelling laundry. [chuckle] Cool. Very detective of me.
1187  [muttering] Okay, so, um, this shirt is— it's navy, right? But I ordered black. I definitely, uh, I definitely clicked black because I needed a black shirt for, um, for that thing next week. But this is... [sigh] this is clearly navy. [slightly annoyed] I mean, it's not— it's not that different, right? Like, navy's close to black, it's just, um, it's just a little more blue-ish? But the thing is, I specifically— I specifically needed black, so this is, uh, this is kind of useless to me. [uncertain] But then again, returning it is such a, um, such a hassle. I'd have to find the— the receipt thing, print out a label, go to the post office... [groan] That's like a whole afternoon of, uh, of running around for one shirt. [trying to convince herself] Maybe I could make navy work? I mean, people probably won't even notice the difference. It's dark, it's professional-looking, it's— wait, no, that's not— that's not the point. I paid for black. [resigned] Ugh, okay, fine. I'll return it. I'll just, um, I'll do it this weekend when I have time to deal with all the... the return nonsense.
1188  [drowsy but contemplative] Okay, so, um— so I could totally just watch the last episode. It's only, like, what, forty-five minutes? Maybe an hour? I mean, I've already— I've already made it through the entire season, so it's not like I can just, uh, just stop now, right? [slightly more animated] But then again, it's already— [yawn] it's already past midnight, and I have that, um, that thing tomorrow morning. What was it? Oh right, the dentist. Which is not, uh, not exactly something I want to be tired for. [wavering] I mean, I could probably— I could probably function on, like, six hours of sleep. That's, um, that's not terrible. People do that all the time, right? Although, uh, although I was pretty useless last time I tried that. [more conflicted] But it's the finale! And I've been waiting to see how this whole, um, this whole thing with Marcus and— and whoever— [trailing off] I mean, what if there's a cliffhanger and I spend all day tomorrow thinking about it anyway? [resigned] Ugh, okay, no, I should— I should probably just go to sleep. Be responsible and all that. The episode will still be there tomorrow, right? [sigh] Right. Sleep it is.
1189  [muttering] Okay, so I just need to, um, I just need to take one good photo for my profile. How hard can it be, right? I mean, everyone else seems to, uh, seems to figure this out just fine. [slightly exasperated] Ugh, okay, that's— that's terrible. Why does my face look so, um, so lopsided? Is my face actually lopsided or is it just the— the camera thing where it flips everything? [sigh] Let me try holding it higher. [concentrating] Right, so they say you're supposed to, uh, supposed to hold it above your eye level, and then— oh god, now I look like I have no chin. That's worse. That's definitely worse. [frustrated but trying] Maybe if I just— if I smile with my eyes more? What does that even mean, smile with your— [laugh] okay, now I look like I'm having some kind of medical episode. [resigned but determined] You know what, let me just take like twenty of these and, um, and hope one of them doesn't make me look like a— like a confused potato. [exhale] Natural lighting. That's the thing I'm missing, right? [trailing off, slightly defeated] Or maybe I should just, uh, maybe I should just use that one from six months ago where I actually looked human...
