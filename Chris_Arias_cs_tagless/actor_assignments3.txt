Character 1: So. I got it.

190 Character 2: Got—wait, got what? Oh my god, oh my god, is this about the thing? The promotion thing? Because if it is, I'm literally gonna scream right now.

Character 1: Yeah. Senior director.

191 Character 2: SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up—are you serious? [Gasp] This is the one you've been waiting for since, what, like 2019? Maybe longer?

Character 1: 2018, actually.

192 Character 2: Okay that's—that's actually insane. Six years. Six whole years of them just... dangling it, y'know? And now it's yours. How are you even feeling right now?

Character 1: I don't know. Tired, mostly.

193 Character 2: Tired? Oh babe, no no no, that's just—I mean, yeah, of course you're exhausted. You've been basically running on fumes waiting for this. But like... also proud? Happy? Anything?

Character 1: They called during lunch. I was eating a sad desk salad.

194 Character 2: A sad desk—[Laugh] okay that's weirdly perfect though? Like you've probably eaten a thousand sad desk salads waiting for this call, right? This is poetic justice or whatever.

Character 1: Guess I need to tell my mom now.

195 Character 2: Oh she's gonna—wait, she's gonna lose it. Hasn't she been asking about this literally every Sunday dinner? "Any news about the job, honey?" That whole thing?

Character 1: Every. Single. Sunday.

196 Character 2: Well now you can finally—actually, y'know what? Now you can be like "Yeah Mom, actually there IS news" and just... drop it on her. [Chuckle] She's gonna cry, isn't she?

Character 1: Probably. She cries at commercials.

197 Character 2: Okay but this is different—this is her baby getting recognized for being, like, absolutely incredible at what they do. Because that's what this is, right? Validation. Finally.

Character 1: Is it weird that I feel the same?

198 Character 2: Feel the—oh honey, no. That's not weird at all. It's like... you've been in limbo for so long that normal probably feels bizarre right now, y'know? When do you actually start?

Character 1: Monday. New office, new everything.

199 Character 2: Monday? That's—wait that's in like three days! Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating this weekend then. And I mean properly celebrating, not just... sitting there looking shell-shocked while I drink champagne at you.

Script: de0717b8_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Got the scholarship.

200 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? The big one? Oh my god, are you serious right now?

Character 1: Yeah. Full ride.

201 Character 2: A full—okay, um, excuse me? [Gasp] That's literally life-changing! Why are you being so calm about this? I'd be like, screaming or crying or—honestly probably both.

Character 1: Still processing it, I guess.

202 Character 2: No no no, that's—that's totally fair actually. It's huge, y'know? Like when something this good happens it's almost... surreal? Did they call you or—how'd you find out?

Character 1: Email. This morning. Almost deleted it as spam.

203 Character 2: You almost—oh my god, imagine. That would've been... [Laugh] okay that's actually terrifying to think about. But like, you checked it! You got it! This is everything you worked for, right?

Character 1: Didn't think I'd actually get it.

204 Character 2: Babe, what? No—you're literally the smartest person I know. All those late nights, all that stress... I mean, they saw what everyone else sees, y'know?

Character 1: Three thousand people applied.

205 Character 2: Three thou—okay and they picked YOU. Out of three thousand! That's like—that's insane odds. Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it.

Character 1: Not yet. Wanted to tell you first.

206 Character 2: You wanted to—[Chuckle] stop, I'm gonna cry. That's so sweet. But also like, call them! Right now! They've been worried about tuition for months, haven't they?

Character 1: Yeah. Mom cried about it last week.

207 Character 2: She's gonna—oh god she's gonna sob. Happy tears this time though. This changes everything for you guys, doesn't it? Like, no more stress about loans or working three jobs or—

Character 1: No more ramen every night.

208 Character 2: Okay but—but you'll still eat ramen with me sometimes, right? [Laugh] Like, for nostalgia? When you're all successful and scholarship-y?

Character 1: Obviously. Yours is better than mine anyway.

209 Character 2: Um, duh, because I actually add vegetables. But seriously though—I'm so, so proud of you. You deserve this more than anyone, and I just... yeah. You did it, babe.

210 SCENARIO: discovering the show they wanted to watch was removed from streaming

==================================================

[settling in, anticipatory]

Okay, so, um, I've got my snacks, I've got my— my blanket, and I'm ready to, uh, to finally watch the next episode of— wait. [pause] Where is it? Where's, um, where's the show?

[confused, muttering]

I mean, it was literally right here yesterday, like, right in my "Continue Watching" thing. Let me just, uh— let me scroll down, maybe it's in, um, in my list somewhere? But that's— that's weird, right?

[slightly annoyed]

Oh, come on. [sigh] Did they— did they seriously remove it? Like, mid-season? Who does that? I was, uh, I was literally three episodes away from finishing and now it's just— [scoff] gone?

[frustrated, talking faster]

This is, um, this is exactly why I don't get attached to shows on streaming anymore. They just, like, they just yank them away when you're— when you're invested and— [groan] great. Cool. Perfect timing.

[resigned, slightly sarcastic]

Well, I guess I'm, uh, I'm finding a new show tonight. Or, I mean, I could always just, um, just stare at my ceiling. That's, uh— that's also an option. [exhale] Fantastic.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 67dd4f6a | Role: Character 1 (A)

211 Character 1: [nervously] So I wrapped Mom's gift last night, the silk scarf from that boutique downtown. [speeding up] You know, the one with the peacock pattern she kept eyeing? [Soft giggle] Cost me half my paycheck but totally worth it.

Character 2: [confused] Wait, wait, wait. [slower] The blue and green peacock scarf? [voice rising] From Margot's Boutique on Fifth Street? Because I literally have that exact same scarf [Nervous laugh] sitting in my car right now.

212 Character 1: [Shrieking laugh] No no no no NO! [breathlessly] This cannot be happening! We literally live in different cities and somehow bought the [voice cracking] SAME scarf? [Snort] Mom's going to think we coordinated this like five-year-olds!

Character 2: [hysterically] I'm dying, I'm actually dying right now! [Gasping breath] Remember when we were kids and showed up in matching outfits? [quieter] She's never letting us live this down. [Cackling] Never ever ever.

213 Character 1: [whimpering] The receipt's at home and the party's in two hours. [more frantically] Maybe we could say it's intentional? Like, [sarcastically sweet] "Oh Mom, we got you matching scarves so you'll never lose one!" [Groaning laugh]

Character 2: [mockingly] Oh brilliant, yes, because every woman dreams of duplicate scarves! [Hissing laugh] Or wait— [excited whisper] what if I return mine super quick and grab those earrings instead? [hopefully] The mall's still open for another hour.

214 Character 1: [relieved shout] YES! Do that! [more calmly] Actually no, traffic's horrible right now with the parade. [defeated] You'd never make it back. [Bitter chuckle] We're stuck being the twins who can't gift separately.

Character 2: [in disbelief] Three hundred dollar scarves. [voice dropping] Three HUNDRED dollars each and we picked the same one. [Explosive laugh] At least it proves we both have expensive taste? [weakly] That's genetic, right? Good genes?

215 Character 1: [through tears] Stop making me laugh, my mascara's running! [Hiccupping giggle] Dad's going to roast us forever about this. [mimicking deep voice] "Six hundred dollars for one scarf, impressive economics girls!" [more hysterically] We're never hearing the end!

Character 2: [panicking] Oh God, Aunt Linda's going to post about this on Facebook! [in dread] "My nieces bought their mother matching scarves, so precious!" [Choking laugh] With like fifty emoji hearts. [resigned] Our reputation as adults is officially over.

216 Character 1: [giggling uncontrollably] You know what though? [more warmly] At least we both noticed what she wanted. [softly] That's pretty sweet actually. [Snorting] Even if we're complete disasters at coordinating surprise gifts between us.

Character 2: [sarcastically bright] Oh sure, we're very observant! [deadpan] So observant we observed the exact same thing. [Wheezing laugh] Next year we're making a shared spreadsheet. [firmly] With color coding and everything, I'm not kidding anymore.

217 Character 1: [mock serious] Spreadsheet? We need a whole database at this point! [getting louder] Password protected, encrypted, with two-factor authentication! [Cackling] "Sarah's Gift Security System" has a nice ring to it, [teasingly] don't you think?

Character 2: [exhausted] I can't breathe, seriously stop! [Gasping] My stomach hurts from laughing. [in a whisper] But imagine Mom's face when she opens the second one. [building up] "Oh wow, another peacock scarf, how... thoughtful?"

218 Character 1: [gleefully] We could make it a competition! [faster] "Mom, judge which daughter wrapped theirs better!" [melodramatically] "Which peacock speaks to your soul more deeply?" [Shrieking giggle] Turn our disaster into performance art, why not?

Character 2: [resigned laugh] You're insane but I love it. [thoughtfully] Although knowing Mom, she'll probably keep both and wear them [sing-song voice] at the same time somehow. [Snort] Remember her layering phase? This is perfect actually.

219 Character 1: [suddenly hopeful] Wait that's TRUE! [excitedly building] She literally wore three necklaces to brunch last week! [triumphant] We didn't buy duplicates, we bought her a matching SET! [Victorious cackle] We're geniuses! Accidental fashion-forward gift-giving geniuses!

Character 2: [playing along] Absolutely! [in fake commercial voice] "The Peacock Scarf Collection, by daughters who definitely planned this!" [normally] We should walk in together holding them up like [Giggling] synchronized swimmers. [determined] Own it completely, no shame.

220 Character 1: [mischievously] Let's tie them together into one mega-scarf! [Wheezing] Six feet of peacock glory wrapped around her! [more seriously] But honestly? [sweetly] She'll probably cry happy tears anyway because we both thought of her.

Character 2: [tenderly] You're right, she really will. [Soft laugh] Two disasters of daughters who love her enough to buy the same overpriced scarf. [warmly building] Come on, let's go face this together. [cheerfully] Matching gift bags and everything!

Script: 24e309d6 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [desperately] Your Honor, I've been trying to work with Meridian Mortgage for eight months—eight months! [voice breaking] My account number is MRD-4429-887B, and I've sent seventeen different hardship applications [shakily] to their office at 2250 Corporate Boulevard.

221 Customer Support: Mrs. Henderson, our records indicate you've missed eleven consecutive payments totaling $18,947.33. The property at 1847 Maple Street is, um, significantly underwater, and we've already extended the grace period twice beyond standard protocol.

Character 1: [frustrated] I lost my job in March—you have the termination letter from Techwise Industries, employee ID TW-90842! [pleading] My husband's medical bills from Northwestern Memorial, case number NM-2023-45K, they're drowning us [voice cracking], we just need three more months!

222 Customer Support: The modification department reviewed your file, reference number MOD-7745-XJ2, on September 15th. [more firmly] Your debt-to-income ratio of 78% exceeds our threshold, and frankly, Mrs. Henderson, we're a business, not a charity organization.

Character 1: [angrily] A business? I've paid you $127,000 over nine years! [louder] Every payment cleared through routing number 044000037, and now [bitterly] because of eleven months, you're taking everything—everything my family built!

223 Customer Support: The original loan agreement, document LN-2014-8823-A, clearly states the consequences of default. Section 14, paragraph 3B specifically outlines the acceleration clause that, well, you apparently didn't read before signing.

Character 1: [desperately] I have $4,500 ready right now—cashier's check 7789043 from First National! [frantically] My sister's lending us another six thousand by Friday, her account ending in 9021, [begging] please, my kids go to Roosevelt Elementary just two blocks away!

224 Customer Support: Four thousand five hundred against nearly nineteen thousand? That's barely 23% of what you owe, and promises about Friday money don't, um, don't satisfy legal obligations or court orders.

Character 1: [sobbing] You sent the notice to the wrong address—4781 Oak Avenue instead of 1847! [accusingly] Your employee, badge number E-5542, told me on July 8th that [shouting] everything was on hold pending review!

225 Customer Support: All correspondence was sent per regulation Z, compliance code CFR-1026.41. Mrs. Henderson, you've had since notice date 08/22/2023 to respond, and verbal assurances don't override written contracts—that's just how it works.

Character 1: [brokenly] The forbearance program, application FB-2023-KL99, you said I qualified when my credit was still 680. [accusingly] Now it's dropped to 515 because of your reporting, and [desperately] no other lender will even look at refinance application RF-8823!

226 Customer Support: Credit reporting is automated through TransUnion, reference TU-445-MMC. Your score dropped because you stopped paying, not—not because we're vindictive, and market conditions have changed since your initial inquiry, obviously.

Character 1: [angrily] My neighbor sold to you last month for $285,000—MLS listing 446829! [frantically] My house appraised at $312,000 in January, document AP-1147-B, so [demanding] why won't you accept a short sale at $275,000?

227 Customer Support: [condescendingly] Market valuations from, um, from eight months ago are irrelevant now. The current BPO report, file BPO-9834-Z, estimates $241,000, and that's assuming optimal conditions which, frankly, don't exist anymore.

Character 1: [pleading] I've been a customer since 2014, account opened October 15th, customer ID MC-778234. [emotionally] Nine years of perfect payments until my husband got sick—doesn't that [voice breaking] count for anything at all?

228 Customer Support: Past payment history doesn't negate current contractual violations under UCC 9-607. [more coldly] The investors holding your note, portfolio PF-2014-Q4-8823, they require us to to pursue all remedies outlined in the security instrument.

Character 1: [desperately] What about the government programs—HARP, HAMP, application numbers GV-4429 and GV-4430? [accusingly] You never processed those properly, never sent confirmation code [shouting] like you were supposed to by law!

229 Customer Support: Those programs expired in 2018 and 2016 respectively, ma'am. Your applications were submitted, well, two years too late, and current FHA guidelines under case FH-9923-C don't apply to conventional loans anyway.

Character 1: [defeated] So that's it then—twenty-three years at 1847 Maple, gone. [bitterly] My daughter's height marks on the doorframe, the garden I planted, [sobbing] all becoming your asset number AS-1847-MP on some spreadsheet.

230 Customer Support: The eviction date is November 30th, per court order CV-2023-8847. You'll receive the cash-for-keys offer, document CFK-9902, for $3,000 if you, um, if you vacate without damage by November 15th.

Script: bf2d99d6 | Role: Customer Support

231 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Bella's Bouquets and Events, this is Sandra speaking. How can I help make your special day perfect?

Character 1: [frazzled] Oh thank god you answered! [speaking rapidly] My wedding is in three weeks and I just found out my venue double-booked us and now we're moving everything to my parents' backyard and [voice breaking] nothing fits anymore!

232 Customer Support: Okay, let's take this one step at a time. I have your file right here—the Morrison wedding, June fifteenth, correct? Tell me about the backyard space we're working with.

Character 1: [panicked] It's... it's smaller, much smaller than the ballroom. [groans] We ordered centerpieces for twenty round tables but now we only have room for maybe twelve rectangular ones? [desperately] Can you even change orders this late?

233 Customer Support: We can absolutely make adjustments. The round centerpieces won't work on rectangular tables, but—here's the good news—[optimistically] we can redesign them as gorgeous runners with the same flowers, actually saves you about three hundred dollars.

Character 1: [surprised] Really? That's... [sighs with relief] okay, that's something. [worried again] But what about the arch? [voice rising] The massive eight-foot arch we ordered for the grand entrance that doesn't exist anymore?

234 Customer Support: Right, the white rose arch with peonies. For a backyard setting, I'd suggest repositioning it as your ceremony backdrop instead. Actually, against natural greenery, it'll photograph even better than in that beige ballroom.

Character 1: [breathing heavily] You're being so helpful, I could cry. [sniffles] Actually, I am crying. [more composed] My mother-in-law keeps saying outdoor weddings look "rustic" like it's [disgustedly] some kind of disease.

235 Customer Support: Rustic is only if you want it to be. We'll add some elegant touches—crystal drops on the arch, maybe upgrade to gold-rimmed vases? [briskly] I can email you photos of our premium outdoor setups right now.

Character 1: [hopefully] Would you? That would be amazing. [pause] [nervously] Should I be worried about the flowers wilting outside? It's supposed to be ninety degrees that day.

236 Customer Support: We've done hundreds of summer outdoor events. We'll deliver everything later, keep them in coolers until setup, and I'll personally spray them with anti-wilt treatment. Your flowers will look fresh all evening, I promise.

Character 1: [gratefully] Sandra, you're literally saving my life right now. [more urgently] Oh wait, one more thing—we had those tall candelabras ordered but [frustrated] obviously can't use real flames outside with the wind.

237 Customer Support: LED candles, battery-operated, they even flicker realistically. [enthusiastically] No fire hazard, no melting wax, and honestly, they photograph identically to real ones. I'll swap those out at no extra charge since it's our venue change policy.

Character 1: [relieved] This is actually starting to sound... manageable? [chuckles nervously] My fiancé said I should just call you instead of having my third panic attack today. [more calmly] He was right.

238 Customer Support: That's what we're here for. So let me recap the changes—twelve rectangular runners instead of twenty round centerpieces, arch relocated for ceremony backdrop, LED candles in the candelabras. Anything else worrying you?

Character 1: [thinking] The boutonnières and corsages are still the same, right? [quickly] And the bridal bouquet? [anxiously] Please tell me we don't need to change those too because I already had my breakdown about those last month.

239 Customer Support: Those stay exactly the same, don't worry. Personal flowers are completely independent of venue. [more briskly] I'll have the revised contract ready by tomorrow morning with the new total, which is actually four hundred less than your original.

Character 1: [shocked] It's less? [laughs in disbelief] I was prepared to pay extra for all these last-minute changes! [emotionally] Sandra, I honestly don't know what I would've done without you today.

240 Customer Support: That's wonderful news for your budget! Listen, I'll also include our emergency day-of contact number. If anything comes up, even the morning of, we have a rapid response team ready.

Character 1: [sighs happily] You know what? [more confidently] Maybe this backyard wedding will be even better than that stuffy ballroom. [gratefully] Thank you so much, Sandra, really—you've turned this disaster into something actually exciting.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

241 [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another story about your promotion—I mean, it's not like I've been trying to tell you about my dad's surgery for twenty minutes. [Tsk]

242 [Fast] You know what, I'm just gonna—actually, never mind, you're clearly not listening anyway. [Sigh]

243 [Disappointed] I literally just asked if you wanted to hear about my trip and you somehow made it about your ex-boyfriend again. [Slow]

244 [Whisper] Do you ever, um, do you ever wonder what's going on in other people's lives? [Sad] Like, at all?

245 [Happy] Wait wait wait—you actually just asked me a question about myself! [Laugh] This is like, historic!

246 [Angry] I'm sorry, but I gotta interrupt here because this is the fifth time today you've told me about your CrossFit routine. [Groan]

247 [Slow] So basically what you're saying is that, uh, everything I experience reminds you of something better that happened to you? [Sarcastic]

248 [Shout] Can we please—PLEASE—have one conversation that doesn't circle back to your dating life? [Tsk]

249 [Chuckle] You know, I was gonna tell you I got engaged, but sure, let's talk about your new haircut for another hour. [Sarcastic]

250 [Fast] Okay so like, remember when I said my mom was sick and you immediately started talking about your yoga instructor? [Disappointed] Yeah, that kinda hurt.

251 [Sad] I just... I dunno, I thought friends were supposed to, you know, care about each other's stuff? [Sigh]

252 [Angry] No no no, don't even try to—you literally haven't asked me a single question all night! [Fast]

253 [Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if you'd even notice if I just... stopped showing up. [Slow] [Sad]

254 [Happy] Oh my god, you're right, MY problems don't matter because YOU had a rough day at brunch! [Sarcastic] [Laugh]

255 [Disappointed] I mean, I guess I could just record myself talking and you probably wouldn't know the difference, right? [Tsk]

256 [Shout] I GOT FIRED TODAY! [Slow] There, I said it—now can we actually talk about it?

257 [Chuckle] It's kinda impressive how you can turn literally any topic into something about yourself—like, that's a talent. [Sarcastic]

258 [Fast] You wanna know something funny? I've been making stuff up about my life just to see if you're even—yeah, you're not listening now either. [Sigh]

259 [Sad] I used to think you were just, um, enthusiastic about sharing, but now I'm starting to think you genuinely don't see me. [Disappointed]

260 [Angry] Honestly? I'm done pretending this is a friendship when it's basically just me being your unpaid therapist. [Groan] [Fast] I'm out.

This must be read out in a single delivery as one file

261 SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a thing they ordered online late at night, then checking the order, then seeing what they actually ordered, ending in impulse purchase horror

==================================================

[casual]

So, um, I had one of those nights last night where I, uh, I couldn't sleep and ended up, like, online shopping at like 2 AM. [light laugh] You know how it is, right? I think I ordered some, um, some stuff for the apartment or whatever. Nothing crazy.

[conversational]

Actually, let me just— let me check what I, uh, what I actually got because I honestly don't really remember. [nervous laugh] I was pretty tired and just, like, clicking around, you know?

[slight concern]

Okay so, um, I'm looking at my email and there's— there's definitely more confirmations than I thought there would be. Like, uh, like several more. Which is... that's probably not great.

[growing worry]

Oh no. Oh, um, oh no no no. There's a— there's a confirmation here for a, uh, a "deluxe herb garden kit"? And then another one for— [exhales] for what looks like a, um, a vintage record player? What was I— why would I need—

[panic building]

Wait, there's more. There's, uh, there's a stand mixer, and— oh my god— a, um, a forty-seven dollar throw pillow that's apparently "artisanally crafted"? What does that even— who spends forty-seven dollars on a—

[full panic]

The total is— [whimper] the total is six hundred and thirty-two dollars! Six hundred! I don't— I don't have six hundred dollars for, um, for random garbage I don't need! What is wrong with me? I can't— I can't afford to be this stupid at 2 AM!
