Character 1: You missed it.

359 Character 2: Oh god, I know—I'm so sorry. I can't believe I—wait, just let me explain what happened, okay? It's not an excuse but I swear there's a reason.

Character 1: I waited for two hours.

360 Character 2: Two hours? Oh no no no, that's—[groan] that's even worse than I thought. I thought maybe you'd leave after like thirty minutes. I didn't realize you'd actually wait that long for me.

Character 1: It was my mom's memorial service.

361 Character 2: I know. God, I know it was and I—I literally hate myself right now. Like I had it in my calendar, I had three alarms set, I was gonna leave early and everything but then—okay this sounds so stupid now.

Character 1: Then what.

362 Character 2: My ex showed up at my apartment. Like out of nowhere, just—just completely melting down about something and I tried to tell them I had to go but they wouldn't—[nervous laugh] sorry, that's not your problem. I should've just left anyway.

Character 1: You chose your ex over being there for me.

363 Character 2: No! No, that's not—I didn't choose anyone, I just got stuck and I couldn't—I mean I could've but I didn't know how to just walk away when someone's crying and I kept thinking I'd make it if I could just calm them down real quick, y'know?

Character 1: Right.

364 Character 2: Please don't—okay, you have every right to be mad. Like genuinely, I would be furious if you missed something that important to me. I'm just—I'm really, really sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything.

Character 1: You could have texted.

365 Character 2: I know, I know I should've. My phone died and I—that's such a cliché excuse, isn't it? [sigh] But I swear it's true. And by the time I got it charged and saw your messages it was already over and I just... I panicked.

Character 1: This mattered to me.

366 Character 2: I know it did. And you—you matter to me too, so much, which is why I can't believe I screwed this up so badly. Like, I keep replaying it and thinking about all the things I could've done differently.

Character 1: I needed you there.

367 Character 2: I'm sorry. I'm just—I'm so sorry. I don't know what else to say except that I completely failed you and I—I wanna make it up to you somehow but I know I can't really make up for missing that. Can I... is there anything I can do?

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe. I need some time.

368 Character 2: Yeah, of course. Take—take all the time you need. I'll be here whenever you're ready to talk or if you need anything at all. And I'm gonna—I mean, if you'll let me, I'd really like to go visit her grave with you sometime. If that's okay.

Script: 466f3bc4_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. I got the fellowship.

369 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? The super competitive one that—oh my god, are you serious right now?

Character 1: Yeah. Found out this morning.

370 Character 2: I'm—okay, I'm literally about to cry. This is huge! Like, this is the biggest— [Gasp] how are you so calm? I'd be screaming!

Character 1: Still processing, I guess.

371 Character 2: No no no, don't do that thing where you downplay everything. This is like—do you even know how many people apply for this? You're basically a genius now.

Character 1: It's just two years of research funding.

372 Character 2: Just two years of—are you kidding me? That's life-changing money! And the prestige, oh my god. Your resume is gonna be like, untouchable. Have you told your parents yet?

Character 1: Not yet. Might wait a bit.

373 Character 2: Okay but like—why? They're gonna lose their minds! In the best way! Unless... wait, are you having second thoughts about it?

Character 1: Maybe. It's in Switzerland.

374 Character 2: Switzerland. You're going to— [Laugh] of course it's somewhere incredible. I mean, that's far but like... chocolate? Mountains? Come on.

Character 1: I don't even speak German.

375 Character 2: So? You'll learn! That's—honestly that's just another skill you're gonna pick up. Plus everyone there speaks English anyway, right? I think? Actually, I dunno, but still!

Character 1: What if I'm not good enough?

376 Character 2: Oh, babe. No. They picked you—out of probably thousands of people, they picked you. That's not luck, y'know? That's them seeing exactly what I see.

Character 1: Which is what, exactly?

377 Character 2: Someone who's brilliant but won't admit it? Like, you literally solve problems I can't even understand. And you're worried about—what, not being good enough? [Sigh] That's imposter syndrome talking.

Character 1: Maybe you're right.

378 Character 2: I'm definitely right. And hey—worst case scenario? You hate it, you come back with an insane story and Swiss chocolate for me. Best case? You're gonna change the world or whatever. No pressure though.

Script: fe5693da_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Really? The trivia story?

379 Character 2: Oh god, I—I didn't think it was gonna come out like that! I swear I was just trying to tell a funny story about game night and then—then it kinda spiraled and I couldn't stop myself.

Character 1: In front of my coworkers.

380 Character 2: I know, I know, that was—that was so stupid of me. I wasn't thinking about how it would sound, y'know? Like in my head it was just this cute story about how you thought Portugal was in South America but then—[nervous laugh]—okay, hearing myself say it now...

Character 1: You made me sound like an idiot.

381 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I mean, everyone has those moments, right? I literally thought reindeer were fake until I was like twenty! Remember? I told that story too but nobody was laughing at that the same way and—wait, that's not helping, is it?

Character 1: Not really.

382 Character 2: Right. Of course. I'm just—I'm making this worse. [Sigh] Look, I genuinely didn't mean to embarrass you. I thought I was being funny and inclusive, like "hey, we all make mistakes" but I see now that I just... I threw you under the bus.

Character 1: They all think I'm stupid now.

383 Character 2: They don't! They—okay, maybe in that moment it was awkward but honestly? James came up to me after and said everyone has geography blindspots. And Lisa admitted she thought Alaska was an island for years because of how maps show it!

Character 1: That's not the point.

384 Character 2: You're right, you're—you're totally right. The point is I betrayed your trust and I made you look bad in front of people you have to see every day. That's—god, that's actually really messed up of me. I wasn't thinking about consequences, I was just... running my mouth like always.

Character 1: Yeah. You were.

385 Character 2: I gotta—I need to fix this somehow. What if I talk to them? Like individually? I could explain that I exaggerated or—or that I got the story wrong? Would that help? [Groan] I dunno, maybe that makes it worse...

Character 1: Don't make it worse.

386 Character 2: Okay, okay, I won't—I won't do anything without asking you first. I promise. No more stories about you, no more trying to be the funny one at your expense. I get it now. I really—I really messed up here.

Character 1: I just wanted them to take me seriously.

387 Character 2: I know. And you—you deserve that, you work so hard and you're literally the smartest person I know. Geography thing aside—sorry, sorry, bad joke. But seriously, you're brilliant and I should've been building you up, not... not whatever that was. I'm really, really sorry.

Character 1: Next time just tell your own embarrassing stories.

388 Character 2: Deal. Absolutely. I've got like—like a million of them anyway. Remember when I tried to shake hands with a mannequin? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I'll just... I'll stick to those. Are we—are we gonna be okay?

Script: ce05411e_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You went to Jamie's party without me.

389 Character 2: Wait, what? I—okay, I went, yeah, but I didn't think you'd—it wasn't like a planned thing. Jamie literally texted me last minute and I just... went.

Character 1: Everyone was there.

390 Character 2: Not everyone, come on. It was like—I dunno, maybe ten people? And honestly, I figured Jamie invited you too. I mean, why would I assume [scoff] you weren't invited?

Character 1: You could've asked.

391 Character 2: Asked? Asked what—"hey, is my best friend invited to your party?" That's—that's weird. I'm not your social secretary, y'know? I just assumed you either couldn't make it or didn't wanna go.

Character 1: Right. You assumed.

392 Character 2: Okay okay, fine, maybe I should've—but you're acting like I deliberately excluded you, which is literally not what happened. I was already there when I realized you weren't coming.

Character 1: And you didn't text me.

393 Character 2: Because I was—look, I was already kinda drunk, and it felt weird to be like "hey, why aren't you here?" Like, what if you weren't invited? Then I'd just be rubbing it in your face. [frustrated laugh] I can't win here.

Character 1: That's your excuse?

394 Character 2: It's not an excuse, it's—ugh, it's what happened. I'm trying to explain that I didn't mean to hurt you, but apparently that doesn't matter because you've already decided I'm the worst friend ever.

Character 1: I didn't say that.

395 Character 2: You don't have to. You're—the way you're looking at me right now... [sigh] Look look, I get that you're upset. I do. But I'm kinda frustrated too because this wasn't intentional.

Character 1: Does it matter if it wasn't intentional?

396 Character 2: Um, yeah? It kinda does? There's a huge difference between "I don't care about your feelings" and "I made a dumb assumption." I mean, come on, we've been friends for how long?

Character 1: Long enough that you should've thought of me.

397 Character 2: I—okay, that's fair. That's... yeah. But you could also, I dunno, give me the benefit of the doubt here? Instead of just assuming I'm this terrible person who wanted to leave you out?

Character 1: Fine. Whatever.

398 Character 2: No, not—not whatever. Look, I'm sorry you got left out, okay? I am. But I'm also not gonna stand here and pretend like I did this horrible thing on purpose when we both know that's not what happened.

399 SCENARIO: waiting for the dryer sheet static to go away

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I just, um, I just need to put this shirt on and— [sharp intake] oh, wow. Okay. That's, uh, that's a lot of static. Like, a lot a lot.

[slightly annoyed]

I mean, I used a dryer sheet, I definitely used a— well, I think I used one? Did I use one? I feel like I grabbed one from the, um, from the box, but maybe it was, like, maybe it was old or something.

[contemplative]

So now what, do I just, uh, do I just wait for it to go away? Is that how this works? [hmm] I could take it off and, like, shake it out or something, but then I'd have to—

[resigned]

You know what, let me just— let me just stand here for a second. Maybe if I don't move too much the, uh, the static will just... dissipate? Is that the word? [slight laugh] I sound like a weather person.

[hopeful]

Okay, okay, that felt like less of a shock when I touched my sleeve just now. Progress! Or maybe I'm just, um, maybe I'm just getting used to being a human lightning rod.

[accepting]

Right, so this is my life now. I'm just gonna be staticky for the next, I don't know, ten minutes? Could be worse, I guess.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 7d27894b | Role: Character 1 (A)

400 Character 1: [quietly] Look at this—Dad's old watch. [voice cracking] Remember how he'd wind it every morning at breakfast? [Shaky exhale] I can still hear that little clicking sound echoing through the kitchen while Mom made coffee.

Character 2: [softly] Yeah, and how he'd tap it [slower] twice for good luck before every important meeting. [Clearing throat] God, I must've watched him do that a thousand times without really seeing it, you know?

401 Character 1: [strained whisper] His cologne bottle's still half full. [Bitter laugh] Thirty years of the same brand—Old Spice Classic. [voice breaking] Why does something so ordinary suddenly feel like it's ripping my chest apart?

Character 2: [defensive tone] Don't spray it. [more firmly] Please, just—don't. I'm not ready for that smell without him attached to it. [Shuddering breath] It's stupid but I need more time before that becomes just another memory.

402 Character 1: [with forced brightness] Oh wow, his joke book! [trembling] "101 Dad Jokes for Every Occasion." [Choked laugh] He actually highlighted his favorites—look, this whole page about fishing puns is practically glowing yellow.

Character 2: [nostalgic warmth] That man never met a pun he didn't love. [getting quieter] Even at the hospital, remember? [Sniffling] Telling the nurses about the skeleton who couldn't go to the party—he had no body to go with.

403 Character 1: [suddenly urgent] We should keep the toolbox intact. Every screwdriver, [emphasizing each word] every random screw and washer. [steadier] I know it's junk mostly, but his hands touched all of it—organized it exactly this way.

Character 2: [irritated] You can't keep everything, man. [gentler] Mom needs to sell the house eventually. [Long sigh] But yeah, okay, the toolbox stays. Maybe his fishing gear too? The rod he taught us with?

404 Character 1: [voice rising] Found the Father's Day cards we made as kids! [laughing through tears] Yours says "World's Okayest Dad" in crayon. [Watery chuckle] Mine just has a stick figure with enormous hands because I couldn't draw.

Character 2: [embarrassed mumble] I thought I was being so clever with that joke. [more animated] Wait, he kept these? [Incredulous] All these years, in his desk drawer? Even that macaroni disaster I made in third grade?

405 Character 1: [hollow tone] His reading glasses are on page 847 of this Tom Clancy novel. [pause] [quieter still] He'll never know how it ends. Somehow that feels worse than everything else—that unfinished story just sitting here forever.

Character 2: [roughly] Stop doing this to yourself. [Shaky breath] He wouldn't want us falling apart over every little— [voice cracks completely] Oh God, is that his birthday list? He was planning Mom's party for next month.

406 Character 1: [fierce whisper] "Reservation at Romano's, yellow roses, [building emotion] chocolate soufflé for dessert." [Breaking down] He drew little stars next to each item like he always did for important things. How are we supposed to tell her?

Character 2: [determined] We'll do it for him. [stronger] Every single thing on this list, exactly how he planned. [Steady exhale] Mom deserves that—one last perfect party from Dad, even if he can't be there himself.

407 Character 1: [exhausted] I'm keeping his coffee mug. [defensive edge] The stupid one with the fishing joke that's barely readable anymore. [Wavering] Don't care if it's worthless—I need something for my morning coffee, something that was his.

Character 2: [gentle understanding] Take it. [warmer] I already grabbed his flannel shirt—the red one. [Soft laugh] Still smells like sawdust from his workshop. Gonna wear it until it falls apart, then probably keep the pieces.

408 Character 1: [sudden realization] Oh no, his phone. [panicking] There's probably voicemails we haven't— [more controlled] Should we listen? What if there's something important, or what if hearing his voice just destroys us completely right now?

Character 2: [firm] Together. [softer] We listen together, okay? [Deep breath] But not today. Let's pack what we can handle and come back when we're stronger. There's no deadline for grief, despite what everyone keeps telling us.

409 Character 1: [bitter irony] Found his bucket list from five years ago. [quieter] "Learn Spanish, visit Ireland, [voice dropping] see the boys get married." [Harsh laugh] He crossed off Ireland at least. One out of three.

Character 2: [thoughtful] Maybe we finish it for him? [building hope] Take Mom to Dublin, learn some Spanish? [Tender smile in voice] The marriage thing—well, that's on us, but I think he'd laugh knowing we're trying to honor even his wildest dreams.

Script: 175448c2 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [furious] This is absolutely unacceptable! [louder] I've been without internet for THREE days now, and I work from home at 4521 Maple Avenue. [groans] My account number is, uh, 78234-KL9, and I'm losing money every single hour this continues!

410 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account right away—that's 78234-KL9, correct? I see you're on our premium business plan, and yes, there's been an outage reported in the 4500 block area since Tuesday.

Character 1: [exasperated] Premium plan? [scoffs] I'm paying $189.99 a month for THIS? [more angrily] Your automated system kept saying it would be fixed by noon yesterday, then 6 PM, and now—nothing! My client meetings are all getting canceled!

411 Customer Support: [sympathetic] I sincerely apologize for those incorrect updates, Mr., uh, Thompson. [more professionally] Our technicians found unexpected damage to the main fiber line near junction box J-447B. [hopeful tone] The good news is they're actually working on it as we speak.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh wonderful, they're "working on it." [frustrated sigh] Look, I need a real timeframe here, not more empty promises. [demanding] Can you guarantee—GUARANTEE—it'll be fixed today, or should I just switch to your competitor?

412 Customer Support: Well, I can't make absolute guarantees, but— let me check the latest tech update. Okay, ticket number TK-9982341 shows 85% completion, estimated restoration by 3:30 PM today. That's about two hours from now.

Character 1: [skeptical] Two hours? [heavy sigh] That's what you people said yesterday at this exact time! [more desperately] I have a video conference with Tokyo at 4 PM—that's my biggest account, worth about $50,000! This better actually work!

413 Customer Support: I completely get why you're concerned about that meeting. Would you like me to set up a mobile hotspot credit to your account—code MHS-COMP? It's normally $30 but I'll waive it, plus I'm adding three months of free service for this inconvenience.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Three months free? [suspicious] What's the catch—there's always a catch with you guys. [sighs] And how fast is this mobile hotspot anyway, because I need at least, uh, 50 megabits for video streaming, you know?

414 Customer Support: No catch at all, sir—it's compensation code COMP-3M-OUT applied directly. [informatively] The hotspot delivers up to 75 megabits, plenty for your conference. I'm also noting priority status on your repair, which means the senior tech, Rodriguez, badge R-1147, will personally verify your connection.

415 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Willow Creek HOA, this is Janet speaking. How may I assist you today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi Janet, it's Tom Miller from unit 47. [sighs heavily] I submitted my deck application six weeks ago and—look—I still haven't heard anything back. [irritated] What's going on over there?

416 Customer Support: Oh, Mr. Miller, let me just... pull up your file here. Yes, I see your submission from October 3rd. It appears it's still under architectural review.

Character 1: [exasperated] Still under review? [louder] My contractor's been waiting, Janet! [groans] Do you people understand I'm paying storage fees for materials that are just sitting there?

417 Customer Support: Sir, I understand your frustration, but [more firmly] the committee only meets once a month. [quickly] Your application missed the October meeting by two days, so it's scheduled for November's agenda.

Character 1: [incredulous] Two days? [sarcastically] So because I was two days late for October, I have to wait an entire extra month? [more angrily] This is exactly why everyone hates dealing with HOAs!

418 Customer Support: Mr. Miller, these procedures are in place to ensure all modifications meet community standards and property values are protected. However, I can flag your application as urgent for the board's attention.

Character 1: [skeptically] Flag it as urgent? [chuckles bitterly] What does that even mean, Janet? [demanding] Will it actually get reviewed faster or is this just something you say to get people off the phone?

419 Customer Support: [more reassuringly] It means the board will review it first during the meeting. Additionally, if you can email me your contractor's timeline, [helpfully] I might be able to request an emergency review—though that requires three board members' approval.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Okay, well... [sighs] that's something at least. [cautiously] What are the chances of getting this emergency review approved? And how long would that take?

420 Customer Support: Between you and me, Mr. Miller, emergency reviews usually go through within 72 hours if the request is reasonable. A simple deck addition shouldn't be controversial.

Character 1: [relieved] Finally, some actual help. [gratefully] Thank you, Janet. I'll send that contractor timeline within the hour—wait, [concerned] what email address should I use?

421 Customer Support: Send it directly to my attention at janet.davis@willowcreekhoa.com. Include photos of the proposed area and [speaking faster] make sure to mention the storage fees you're incurring—the board responds well to financial hardship arguments.

Character 1: [appreciatively] You know what, Janet? [more warmly] You're the first person there who's actually given me useful information. [curiously] Why can't all the HOA staff be this helpful?

422 Customer Support: [chuckles softly] Well, Mr. Miller, I've been here twelve years and I've learned which battles are worth fighting. [more seriously] Just get me that email and I'll do my best for you.

Character 1: [determined] Alright, twelve years—you must've seen it all. [lighter tone] One more question though, [cautiously] what happens if they reject it even after all this?

423 Customer Support: They rarely reject decks unless there's a major code violation. If they request modifications, we can usually resolve those within a week through email correspondence—no waiting for another meeting.

Character 1: [sighs with relief] That's... actually reasonable. [apologetically] Sorry for getting heated earlier, Janet. [sincerely] This whole process has just been incredibly frustrating, you know?

424 Customer Support: No apology necessary, Mr. Miller. [warmly] Trust me, if I had to wait six weeks for a deck approval, I'd be calling here pretty frustrated too.

Character 1: [gratefully] Thanks for understanding. [decisively] I'll get that email sent right away and—Janet—[hopefully] I really hope this emergency review thing works out.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

425 [Nervous] Um, does anyone actually know if that emergency button, like—does it really work or is it just for show? [Laugh]

426 [Angry] This is literally the third time this month I've been—I'm filing a complaint with building management, I swear. [Groan]

427 [Happy] Well, at least we're not alone, right? [Chuckle] I mean, imagine being stuck in here by yourself—that'd be way worse!

428 [Whisper] Do you guys hear that creaking sound or is it just—oh god, please tell me you hear it too. [Fast]

429 [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, my phone's at two percent, because of course it is. [Tsk] This day just keeps getting better.

430 [Slow] So, uh, anyone here actually claustrophobic? [Sad] Because I'm kinda starting to feel it now, honestly.

431 [Disappointed] I had a job interview in—actually, forget it, they're never gonna believe this excuse anyway. [Sigh]

432 [Fast] Okay so basically my wife's gonna think I'm lying about being stuck because last week I said I was stuck in traffic when I wasn't—this is bad. [Groan]

433 [Shout] HELLO? CAN ANYONE OUT THERE HEAR US? [Angry] WE'RE BETWEEN FLOORS THREE AND FOUR!

434 [Chuckle] Y'know, this is actually kinda like that episode of The Office where—wait, did anyone else watch that show?

435 [Sad] My daughter's recital starts in twenty minutes and I promised her I'd—I promised I wouldn't miss another one. [Sigh]

436 [Sarcastic] Sure, let's all just breathe each other's recycled air for the next hour, that sounds super fun. [Disappointed]

437 [Happy] Hey, wanna play twenty questions while we wait? [Fast] I mean, we gotta do something to pass the time, right?

438 [Whisper] I really, really need to use the bathroom—like, this is gonna get embarrassing real quick if we don't get out soon. [Tsk]

439 [Slow] You ever notice how elevator music just... stops when something goes wrong? [Chuckle] Like even the music abandons ship.

440 [Angry] [Fast] I told them—I literally told maintenance last week that this thing was making weird noises but did they listen? No!

441 [Disappointed] I guess my ice cream's gonna be completely melted by the time we—wait, can you suffocate in these things? [Whisper]

442 [Happy] This'll be a great story for dinner parties though—"Remember that time I got trapped with five strangers?" [Laugh]

443 [Sad] [Slow] My anxiety meds are in my car, so this is, um... this is gonna be interesting.

444 [Shout] PRESS THE BUTTON AGAIN! [Sarcastic] Maybe it just needs some aggressive encouragement to start working!

445 SCENARIO: Casually describing a screenshot they took of a conversation, then checking their camera roll, then finding they accidentally sent it to the person, spiraling into screenshot horror

==================================================

[casual]

So I took this screenshot earlier of Maya's text about the whole drama with her roommate. You know how she is with like, oversharing about every little conflict? [light laugh] I just wanted to show you how ridiculous it was getting.

[conversational]

I'm scrolling through my camera roll now trying to find it, and oh my god, I have like two hundred screenshots in here. When did I become this person? Half of them are just random tweets I'll never look at again.

[slightly amused]

But yeah, Maya was going on about how her roommate left dishes in the sink for— wait, hold on. [pause] Wait, where did the screenshot go? I swear I just took it like an hour ago.

[confused] [a bit concerned]

That's weird, it's not here. Unless... [nervous laugh] unless I... no, no way. I wouldn't have sent it directly to— let me just check my messages real quick.

[dawning horror]

Oh no. Oh no no no. I sent it TO Maya. I sent Maya a screenshot of her own dramatic text. [groan] She's gonna see that I was making fun of her to—

[panic building]

My phone's buzzing. She's calling. She's actually calling me right now! [whimpering] What do I even say? "Hey Maya, sorry I screenshotted your personal drama to mock you"?

[full panic] [mortified]

I can't answer this. I literally cannot face this conversation. I'm the worst friend alive!
