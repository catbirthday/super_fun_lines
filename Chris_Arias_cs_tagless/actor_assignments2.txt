Script: 1d04c924_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You knew about the layoffs.

88 Character 2: I—okay, yes, I knew something was coming, but it wasn't like I had details or—I mean, I couldn't just tell you based on rumors, y'know?

Character 1: Three weeks. You knew for three weeks.

89 Character 2: That's not—[sigh] okay okay, I heard whispers three weeks ago, but nothing concrete until like, last Tuesday. And even then, I wasn't supposed to know. My manager literally made me promise not to say anything.

Character 1: I'm your best friend.

90 Character 2: And my job is how I pay rent! Come on, you're acting like I—like I wanted this to happen. I've been losing sleep over this, trying to figure out if I should tell you or not.

Character 1: Guess you made your choice.

91 Character 2: That's really unfair. I tried to—look, I kept dropping hints, remember? I told you to update your resume, I said the company was being weird lately. [frustrated laugh] What did you think I meant?

Character 1: Not this.

92 Character 2: Well I couldn't exactly spell it out! I'm sorry you're—no, actually, y'know what? I'm kinda frustrated too. You're making me the bad guy when management's the one who screwed you over.

Character 1: Management didn't pretend to be my friend.

93 Character 2: Pretend? Are you—wow. Okay. That's what you think this is? Ten years of friendship and I'm suddenly pretending because I was in an impossible situation?

Character 1: You could've warned me. One text. Anything.

94 Character 2: And lose my job too? Then we'd both be screwed. I mean—I get that you're hurt, I really do, but honestly? You're not even trying to—[groan] whatever. Fine. I should've risked everything to tell you something I barely knew myself.

Character 1: Yeah. You should've.

95 Character 2: That's easy to say when you're not the one who'd be violating an NDA. Look look, I'm sorry you found out this way, I am, but I was literally trying to protect both of us here.

Character 1: By protecting yourself.

96 Character 2: By not making things worse! If I'd told you and you'd confronted them or—or started acting different, they would've known. We both would've been out immediately. Is that what you wanted?

Character 1: I wanted a heads up.

97 Character 2: And I wanted to give you one without destroying my entire career. [quieter] I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to do both. But I'm not gonna pretend I don't feel kinda betrayed too that you think I'd ever intentionally hurt you like this.

Script: 1b40d189_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Stop rewriting history.

98 Character 2: What? I'm not—I don't rewrite anything! I just remember things differently sometimes, that's all. Everyone does that, right? Memory isn't like, perfect or anything.

Character 1: You told everyone I was drunk at Katie's party.

99 Character 2: Wait wait wait, hold on—I didn't say drunk, I said you were tipsy! There's a difference and I—okay that's not the point. [nervous laugh] I shouldn't have said anything at all, I know.

Character 1: I had one beer.

100 Character 2: Right, yeah, no no no, you're right. I think I got confused with another party maybe? Or I just—I dunno, sometimes stories get mixed up in my head and I don't mean to—

Character 1: This happens every single time.

101 Character 2: That's not—okay, I can see why you'd think that. But I swear I'm not doing it on purpose! My brain just kinda... fills in gaps sometimes? And then I believe my own version and—god, that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.

Character 1: You made me think I was losing my mind.

102 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm—I'm so sorry. I never wanted to make you feel like that, I swear. That's like, literally the worst thing and I—[groan] I really messed up, didn't I?

Character 1: The concert tickets? The restaurant incident? My birthday?

103 Character 2: Okay those—those were all misunderstandings! Except maybe the birthday thing, I definitely got that wrong. But I honestly thought I was remembering correctly! I wasn't trying to gaslight you or whatever, I just—my memory sucks sometimes.

Character 1: It's not just your memory. You insist you're right.

104 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I do that. I get all defensive and then I double down even when I'm probably—definitely wrong. It's this stupid thing where I can't admit I might be misremembering because then I feel like an idiot.

Character 1: So you make me feel like one instead.

105 Character 2: Fuck. When you put it like that—I mean, that's exactly what I've been doing, isn't it? [quieter] God, I'm such an asshole. No wonder you're mad at me.

Character 1: I need you to stop doing this.

106 Character 2: I will. I promise I will. From now on if I'm not sure about something, I'll just—I'll say that, y'know? Like "hey, I might be wrong but" instead of acting like I have perfect recall. Because clearly I don't.

Character 1: Okay. We can try that.

107 Character 2: Really? You're—you're giving me another chance? Thank you, seriously. And next time just call me out immediately, okay? Like don't let me spiral into my weird false memory thing. Just be like "nope, that's not what happened" and I'll shut up.

Script: 86db0541_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Hit my number today. The savings goal.

108 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you hit it? Like, the whole thing? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! How long has it been, like six months? Eight?

Character 1: Fourteen months.

109 Character 2: Fourteen—okay wow, that's some serious dedication right there. I mean, I can't even save for like, a weekend trip without accidentally [Laugh] buying something stupid online, y'know?

Character 1: It wasn't that hard. Just automated transfers.

110 Character 2: No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you minimize it! This is huge! Like, literally huge. What was it for again, the house thing or—?

Character 1: Emergency fund. Six months expenses.

111 Character 2: Six months? That's so—honestly that's so smart. Most people don't even have like, six days saved, right? You must feel so... I dunno, secure? Free?

Character 1: Feels weird, actually.

112 Character 2: Weird how? Like good weird or—wait, are you okay? You don't seem as excited as I thought you'd—I mean, I'd be like, popping champagne or something [Chuckle].

Character 1: Just... now what? Been focused on this so long.

113 Character 2: Oh. Oh, I totally get that. It's like when you finish a really long show and you're just kinda... lost? But hey, this is—this is the fun part now, right?

Character 1: Fun part?

114 Character 2: Yeah! Like, you can actually think about other goals without that hanging over you. Maybe something actually fun this time? Travel or—ooh, or that photography thing you mentioned?

Character 1: Photography thing was three years ago.

115 Character 2: Okay but—but you were so into it! And now you've got this cushion, so if you wanted to like, take a class or buy decent equipment, you totally could without the guilt.

Character 1: Maybe. Haven't thought about it.

116 Character 2: Well, start thinking! This is—god, I'm so proud of you, seriously. Most people just talk about doing this stuff but you actually [Sigh] did it, y'know?

Character 1: Thanks. Means a lot.

117 Character 2: Um, we're definitely celebrating though. Like, I don't care if you think it's not a big deal—we're getting dinner. The good place, not the sketchy taco truck. Although... actually the taco truck sounds pretty good too.

Script: 2dc10592_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Everyone knew about the cabin trip except me.

118 Character 2: Wait, what? No, that's—I thought you knew! Marcus said he was gonna tell you like, weeks ago. I literally assumed you just couldn't make it or something.

Character 1: Well, he didn't.

119 Character 2: Okay but—how is that my fault? I'm not the one organizing it. Jake's been handling all the—the group chat stuff, and I just figured... [sigh] I mean, you're always in the loop about everything.

Character 1: Apparently not.

120 Character 2: Come on, that's not—you're acting like I deliberately excluded you. I didn't even make the group chat! I got added to it like, three days after it started.

Character 1: You could've checked. Asked if I was coming.

121 Character 2: I—okay, yeah, maybe I could've, but honestly? You've been so busy lately, barely responding to texts, and I just... I dunno, I thought maybe you were taking a break from group stuff. [frustrated laugh] Which apparently was the wrong assumption.

Character 1: So you just decided for me.

122 Character 2: No! That's not—god, you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're making it sound like there was this big conspiracy to leave you out, and that's literally not what happened.

Character 1: Six people knew. Six.

123 Character 2: And they all probably thought the same thing I did! We—I mean, you know how these things go, everyone assumes someone else handled it. It's not great, I know that, but it's not personal.

Character 1: Feels pretty personal.

124 Character 2: Well it wasn't meant to be! Jesus, I—[scoff] I'm sorry you got left out, okay? I am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you think I'd do that to you on purpose. Like, really? After everything?

Character 1: You had three weeks to mention it.

125 Character 2: I didn't—we barely hung out those three weeks! You cancelled on coffee twice, and when we did text it was about your work drama. When was I supposed to casually bring up a trip I thought you already knew about?

Character 1: Anytime. Literally anytime would've worked.

126 Character 2: Okay okay, fine. You're right. I should've—I should've brought it up. But you gotta understand, I wasn't trying to hide it from you. That's... that's what's killing me here. You think I was being shady and I just... wasn't.

Character 1: But you were all talking about it. Making plans. Without me.

127 Character 2: Yeah. We were. And I—look, I fucked up by assuming, alright? But you're not exactly blameless here either. You've been MIA for weeks, and now you wanna act like we're terrible friends for not chasing you down? That's not... [trails off] Whatever. I don't know what you want me to say.

Script: 4f60e80b_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. I got the internship.

128 Character 2: Wait wait wait—THE internship? The one you were like, totally convinced you wouldn't get? Oh my god, are you serious right now?

Character 1: Yeah. Found out this morning.

129 Character 2: I'm—okay I'm literally about to scream. This is huge! Like, this is the one at the place with the—with all the fancy people, right? [Gasp] When do you start?

Character 1: Three weeks. They want me to relocate.

130 Character 2: Three—okay that's soon. That's really soon. But like, they're helping with that stuff, right? Housing and everything? Because honestly, that's kinda fast to just pack up and—

Character 1: They cover it. Full stipend.

131 Character 2: Of course they do, because you're—I mean, they'd be stupid not to. God, I'm so proud of you. Like, genuinely. You worked your ass off for this.

Character 1: It's just an internship.

132 Character 2: No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay it. This is literally, what, like a thousand people applied? And they picked YOU. [Laugh] That's not "just" anything.

Character 1: Twelve hundred, actually.

133 Character 2: Twelve hun—see? SEE? That's even more insane! Are you, like... are you excited? You seem kinda... I dunno, quiet about it.

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe. It's a lot.

134 Character 2: Yeah, no, totally—that makes sense. It's like, even good stuff can be overwhelming, y'know? The whole moving thing and starting somewhere new and... yeah.

Character 1: What if I'm not good enough?

135 Character 2: Oh, babe. Okay, um—can I be real with you for a sec? They don't just randomly pick people. Like, they saw something in you that—[Sigh] that maybe you don't see yet.

Character 1: Everyone there went to Ivy Leagues.

136 Character 2: And? So what? You're gonna—you're gonna show up and be yourself and that's literally why they wanted you. Not some, like, cookie-cutter Ivy League robot, y'know?

Character 1: Yeah. Maybe you're right.

137 Character 2: I'm always right about this stuff. Honestly though? You're gonna kill it. And I'm gonna need, like, weekly updates because I'll be living vicariously through you.

138 SCENARIO: realizing they forgot their reusable cup for the coffee shop

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I'm, um, I'm almost there and I just— [sigh] where's my cup? My reusable cup thing? I literally, like, I literally put it right by my keys last night so I wouldn't— so I wouldn't forget it again.

[slightly annoyed]

But it's not— it's not in my bag, obviously, because that would be, um, that would be too easy. [tsk] I can just picture it sitting there on my, uh, on my kitchen counter, looking all smug and— and unused.

[resigned]

I mean, I could go back, but that's like a fifteen minute detour and I'm already, um, I'm already running kind of late for the thing. Plus the barista's gonna judge me, right? Like, "Oh, here's this person again with no cup."

[thoughtful]

Although, wait— do they even care? I feel like they probably see this, um, this exact situation like fifty times a day. It's not that deep.

[brightening]

You know what, I'll just— I'll just get the paper cup today and try to, uh, try to remember tomorrow. It's fine. It's literally fine. One cup isn't gonna destroy the planet.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: e4b7b65e | Role: Character 1 (A)

139 Character 1: [nervously] Hi Marcus, thanks for meeting with me. [clearing throat] I know this transition has been... complicated. [quieter] I really value your experience here, and I'd love to discuss how we can work together moving forward.

Character 2: [flat tone] Sure, boss. [more sarcastically] Eight years of experience, right here at your service. [bitter laugh] What exactly did you want to discuss about my role supporting someone who's been here three months?

140 Character 1: [defensive] Look, I didn't ask for this promotion over you. [softer] But I'm here now, and we need to make this work. [steadier voice] Can we at least try to find some common ground professionally?

Character 2: [slow and measured] Common ground. [scoff] You want common ground when you got my job because you have an MBA? [louder] I built half the systems you're using! [trailing off] But sure, let's find common ground.

141 Character 1: [frustrated sigh] This isn't about degrees, Marcus! [pleading] I need your help—I'm drowning here. [whispered admission] I don't even understand half the technical stuff you built, and everyone expects me to just know it all.

Character 2: [surprised] Wait, you're actually admitting that? [more gently] Most new managers come in acting like they know everything. [contemplative pause] Maybe you're not completely hopeless after all. [mumbling] Though the jury's still out on that one.

142 Character 1: [exhausted laugh] I'm too tired to pretend anymore. [desperately] Yesterday I accidentally deleted a client database thinking it was a test file. [panicked whisper] IT recovered it, but I nearly had a heart attack waiting.

Character 2: [shocked gasp] You deleted the Morrison account database? [building anger] That took me six months to optimize! [suddenly amused] Though honestly, watching Jerry from IT panic must have been worth the price of admission.

143 Character 1: [relieved giggle] Jerry turned three different shades of purple. [more seriously] But Marcus, this is exactly why I need you. [genuine tone] Would you consider being technical lead? Same team, but you'd own all system architecture decisions.

Character 2: [skeptical] Technical lead? [considering slowly] So I'd have autonomy over the systems, but you'd handle all the budget meetings and executive presentations? [interested now] You mean I could skip those awful quarterly reviews with corporate?

144 Character 1: [eagerly] Yes, exactly that! [laughing] God, I hate those quarterly reviews too. [confidentially] Last week Henderson talked for forty minutes about synergy. [groaning] I wanted to throw myself out the conference room window.

Character 2: [genuine laughter] Henderson and his synergy speeches! [reminiscing] Once I counted—he said it thirty-seven times in one presentation. [warming up] Maybe we could tag-team this thing after all, if you're serious about the technical autonomy.

145 Character 1: [firmly] Completely serious. [hopeful] You know the systems, I'll handle the politics. [quieter and sincere] Plus, between us, your salary adjustment would reflect the expanded role—I already got it pre-approved before asking you here.

Character 2: [impressed whistle] You got budget approval before our meeting? [respectfully] That's actually pretty smart negotiating. [chuckling] Alright rookie, you might survive this job after all. When would this new arrangement start exactly?

146 Character 1: [excited] Monday, if you're on board! [quickly] I've already drafted the org chart changes. [nervous again] Though I should warn you, Peterson from accounting is furious about the budget increase—he might corner you.

Character 2: [dismissive laugh] Peterson's been furious since 1987, that's nothing new. [determined] Fine, I'm in. [warning tone] But if you micromanage my technical decisions, this partnership ends. I won't tolerate design-by-committee nonsense.

147 Character 1: [relief washing over] Thank God, I thought you'd say no. [firmly] Zero micromanaging, I promise. [lighter] Honestly, I'll be too busy trying to understand what you're doing to interfere anyway. [pause] That's a joke. Mostly.

Character 2: [dry humor] Mostly, she says. [more warmly] Look, Sarah, we both know this company promoted you for reasons beyond merit. [thoughtfully] But maybe that's not your fault—and maybe we can actually fix things together.

148 Character 1: [vulnerably] Thank you for saying that, Marcus. [steadying breath] I know I have a lot to learn from you. [determined] But I promise I'll also have your back with upper management—that's something I actually am good at.

Character 2: [accepting tone] Fair enough. [slight smile in voice] Let's get coffee tomorrow and you can show me that org chart. [sarcastically optimistic] Who knows? Maybe this disaster will actually work out. [chuckle] Stranger things have happened around here.

Script: d38fb651 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, this is the THIRD time my dishwasher has broken down since July. [raising voice] I've got warranty number DW-78342-K right here, and I'm—I'm just about done with this whole situation. [sighs heavily] What exactly is wrong with your products?

149 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. Let me pull up your account using that warranty number—DW-78342-K, correct? [concerned] I see here we've serviced your unit on July 15th and September 2nd.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, you can SEE that, can you? [bitter laugh] Well then maybe you can also see that I paid $1,200 for what's apparently a very expensive paperweight. [more angrily] My address is still 4827 Maple Drive, and I need someone here TODAY.

150 Customer Support: Sir, I'm going to personally escalate this to our senior technician team. We have an opening tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM or—wait, actually—I can squeeze you in today at 4:15 PM.

Character 1: [incredulous] Tomorrow? Or 4:15? [groans] That's in three hours, and I've got a dinner party at seven with—with twelve people coming! [desperately] Can't someone come NOW? My member ID is AC-5509 if that helps bump me up somehow.

151 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I wish I could send someone immediately, Mr. Chen. But our technician, Marcus, badge number T-4421, can definitely fix this before your party. [encouraging] He's our most experienced specialist with a 98% first-visit resolution rate.

Character 1: [skeptically] Ninety-eight percent, huh? [scoffs] Well, considering I'm on breakdown number three, I'm not exactly filled with confidence here. [demanding] And what happens when it breaks AGAIN next month?

152 Customer Support: [professionally] Given your situation, I'm authorizing a full unit replacement if today's repair doesn't hold. [more confidently] I'm adding override code RX-9000-PRIORITY to your file right now. This shouldn't have happened three times, and we're going to make it right.

Character 1: [surprised] A replacement? [cautiously hopeful] Well that's—okay, that's something at least. [sighs] Fine, send Marcus at 4:15, but he better not be late like last time when your guy showed up at 6:47 instead of 4:00.

153 Customer Support: Marcus will receive your service ticket immediately with high priority status. [earnestly] I'm also crediting your account $200 for the inconvenience—confirmation code CR-7734-M. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Chen?

Character 1: [slightly calmer] The credit is... appreciated, I suppose. [matter-of-factly] Just make sure Marcus knows it's the model DLX-500 with the—the digital display that keeps showing error E4. [tired] I've memorized that stupid code by now.

154 Customer Support: I'm noting that specifically—DLX-500, error code E4 on the digital display. Marcus will bring replacement parts for the control board and heating element, which are the usual culprits. We'll get this resolved today.

Character 1: [resigned] Yeah, well, they said that last time too when tech number—what was it—[frustrated] B-3356 came out and basically just pressed buttons for an hour. [more firmly] Marcus better actually know what he's doing.

155 Customer Support: Marcus has twelve years with our company and specializes in the DLX series. I see tech B-3356's notes were... limited, which isn't acceptable. [more seriously] I'm documenting everything in your file for our quality assurance team to review.

Character 1: [cynically] Quality assurance—[dry laugh] that's rich considering the quality I've been assured of so far. [demanding tone] You know what, I want a direct number to call if this doesn't work out at 4:15.

156 Customer Support: Absolutely, you can reach me directly at extension 4-0-9-2, ask for Sarah, employee ID S-1147. [sincerely] I'll be here until 8 PM tonight, and I'll personally follow up tomorrow morning. [determined] We're going to solve this.

Character 1: [writing down] Extension 4092, Sarah, S-1147, got it. [exhales] And if Marcus is even five minutes late, I'm calling that number immediately, you understand? [firmly] My twelve guests aren't eating off paper plates.

157 Customer Support: Marcus will be there at 4:15 sharp—I'm sending him your gate code 7-7-3-9 right now. He'll call you at the number ending in 8845 when he's ten minutes away. Your dinner party won't be affected, I promise.

Character 1: [reluctantly accepting] Fine, gate code 7739, and yes, my cell ends in 8845. [sighs deeply] I just—I really hope this is the last time we have to do this dance, Sarah. [wearily] Three breakdowns in four months is just ridiculous.

158 Customer Support: I completely agree, Mr. Chen, three breakdowns is unacceptable. After Marcus completes the repair, I'll personally ensure your replacement unit is pre-authorized and ready if needed. Thank you for your patience, and Marcus will see you at 4:15.

Script: 0d38bee2 | Role: Customer Support

159 Customer Support: Good afternoon, I see you're contacting us about a return issue. Let me pull up your account here and—oh, I'm seeing two previous attempts. Can you tell me what happened?

Character 1: [exasperated] What happened? What HAPPENED? [groans] I've sent this blender back twice already, and somehow it keeps showing up at my door like a boomerang. [sarcastically] It's broken, it doesn't work, and I just want my money back!

160 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, truly. Looking at the notes here... um, it seems there was a processing error on our end. Let me escalate this right now to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Character 1: [skeptically] That's what the last agent said. [sighs heavily] And the one before that. [frustrated] I've got three return labels, two confirmation emails, and somehow still have this—this expensive paperweight sitting on my counter!

161 Customer Support: You're absolutely right to be upset. Here's what I'm doing differently—I'm personally flagging this for manual review and, uh, bypassing the automated system entirely. Would you prefer a full refund or store credit with an additional 20% bonus?

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, you can actually do that? [cautiously hopeful] The last two agents just kept... kept sending me in circles. [tiredly] I just want the refund, please, before this thing becomes a permanent fixture in my kitchen.

162 Customer Support: Processing the refund right now as we speak. [quickly] You'll see it in 3-5 business days, and I'm—I'm also emailing you a prepaid return label that's priority tracked. This one goes directly to our special returns department.

Character 1: [relieved] Thank God, finally someone who knows what they're doing. [chuckles dryly] Though I have to ask—what makes this label different from the other two labels that apparently led nowhere?

163 Customer Support: The previous labels went through standard returns, which... which apparently had a glitch with your order code. This one has a override code that I've personally attached. It cannot be redirected back to you.

Character 1: [gratefully] You know what? Thank you. [sighs] Really, thank you for actually listening and not just reading from a script. [hopefully] So I just pack it up one more time and drop it off?

164 Customer Support: Exactly, and I've added a note for free pickup service if you prefer. [briskly] The driver will come tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM, or—or you can drop it off yourself. [cheerfully] Whatever's easier for you after this hassle.

Character 1: [appreciatively] The pickup would be amazing, honestly. [laughs softly] I was starting to think I'd adopted this blender permanently. [curiously] Will I get a confirmation when it's actually received this time?

165 Customer Support: Absolutely! You'll get three confirmations actually—pickup, facility arrival, and refund processed. I'm also sending you my direct extension in case, um, in case anything goes sideways. But it won't.

Character 1: [impressed] Wow, you're really covering all the bases here. [more relaxed] This is so different from my last two calls where I just got... got transferred around. [genuinely] I actually believe this might work this time.

166 Customer Support: It will work, I guarantee it. Between you and me, I've flagged this as a priority case because three attempts is—is completely unacceptable. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Actually, yes—can you make sure this doesn't affect my account standing? [worried] I don't want to be flagged as a problem customer when this whole mess wasn't even my fault.

167 Customer Support: [reassuringly] Oh, absolutely not! I'm adding a detailed note explaining the situation, and actually—actually I'm adding a loyalty credit to your account for the inconvenience. [firmly] Your account standing is perfect.

Character 1: [surprised] A loyalty credit too? [chuckles] You're really going above and beyond here. [sincerely] I went from ready to cancel my membership to actually feeling valued as a customer.

168 Customer Support: That's exactly what we want to hear. You'll receive all the confirmation emails within the next five minutes, including my direct line. Thank you for your patience through this whole ordeal.

Character 1: [gratefully] No, thank YOU for actually solving this. [sighs contentedly] Third time really was the charm—well, third agent anyway. [happily] Have a great rest of your day!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

169 [Angry] Look, I don't care what everyone thinks—pineapple on pizza is actually, like, the perfect combination of sweet and savory, okay? [Tsk]

170 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because the majority is always right about everything. [Laugh] Remember when everyone thought the earth was flat?

171 [Fast] I've done the research, I've looked at the data, and honestly the numbers don't—they just don't lie about this stuff. [Defensive]

172 [Whisper] Between you and me, I think deep down, um, people actually agree but they're too scared to admit it. [Sigh]

173 [Happy] You know what? I'm glad I believe this! [Laugh] It makes me different and I kinda like standing out from the crowd.

174 [Slow] The thing is... nobody wants to hear it because it challenges what they've believed their whole lives, y'know? [Disappointed]

175 [Shout] Would you just let me finish my point before you—before you jump all over me about it? [Groan]

176 [Sad] I used to keep quiet about it, but I'm just, I'm tired of pretending I agree when I really, really don't. [Sigh]

177 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, another person telling me I'm wrong without actually listening to my reasoning—how original.

178 [Fast] [Happy] Actually wait, wait, wait—I found three studies that basically prove what I'm saying, so it's not just me being weird!

179 [Disappointed] I mean, I thought you of all people would at least, like, try to understand where I'm coming from. [Tsk]

180 [Angry] [Fast] This is exactly why I don't usually bring it up because everyone gets all—they get defensive and won't even consider it!

181 [Chuckle] Honestly? In ten years everyone's gonna pretend they believed this all along. [Sarcastic] Mark my words.

182 [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm actually wrong, but then I remember... no, no, the evidence is there.

183 [Slow] You're allowed to disagree, but, um, dismissing it without even thinking about it? [Disappointed] [Sigh] That's just closed-minded.

184 [Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, finally someone who's willing to actually discuss it instead of just laughing at me!

185 [Groan] Here we go again—I mention it once and suddenly I'm the, the crazy person in the room. [Angry]

186 [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, let's all just believe the same thing forever and never question anything—that sounds super healthy for society.

187 [Sad] [Slow] I dunno, maybe I'm just seeing something that... that other people can't see yet, or won't see.

188 [Shout] It's not stupid! [Angry] [Fast] Just because it's different doesn't mean—ugh, why do I even bother trying to explain anymore?

189 SCENARIO: Casually talking about a backup they assumed existed, then checking, then finding years of work isn't actually backed up anywhere, spiraling into data loss terror

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, so I was working on my novel today—you know, the one I've been plugging away at for like three years now? And my laptop started making this weird clicking sound. [light laugh] Like, really weird. So I'm thinking, okay, time to maybe get this checked out before it dies on me completely.

[matter-of-fact]

But whatever, right? I mean, everything's backed up to the cloud anyway. I set that up ages ago when I first started writing seriously. Plus I'm pretty sure I copied everything to that external drive at some point.

[slightly concerned]

Actually, let me just double-check real quick... [pause] Hm. Okay, so the cloud thing—apparently I have like two gigabytes of storage and I used it all up in 2019? And it just... stopped backing up? 

[growing worried]

And this external drive... [nervous laugh] this is just photos. This is all photos from college. Where's my—where are my documents? 

[panic building]

Wait, wait, wait. When did I last actually save this anywhere else? I've been writing on the same laptop for... [sharp exhale] Oh god. Oh no.

[spiraling] [frantic]

Three years! Three years of writing! Sixty thousand words! I never—I just assumed—who doesn't back things up?! [hysterical laugh] Me! I don't back things up! What kind of writer am I?! 

[full panic]

It's all gone! It's all just... sitting on a dying hard drive and I'm—[whimper]—I'm gonna lose everything!
