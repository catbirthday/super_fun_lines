Character 1: So the app went live this morning.

523 Character 2: Wait wait wait—THE app? The one you've been like, basically living and breathing for the past what, eight months? Oh my god, how are you feeling right now?

Character 1: Good. Downloads are decent.

524 Character 2: Decent? Are you—okay you're being so casual about this but like, this is huge! I mean, you literally built this thing from nothing. [Laugh] Give me numbers, what's decent?

Character 1: Twenty thousand in the first six hours.

525 Character 2: Twenty thou—holy shit. That's not decent, that's like... that's incredible! Wait, is that good? I feel like that's really good, right?

Character 1: It's above projections.

526 Character 2: Above projections, he says. You're just gonna—okay, you're gonna sit there and act like you didn't just absolutely crush it? This is so typical of you, honestly.

Character 1: There's still a lot that could go wrong. Server costs, user retention.

527 Character 2: No no no, we're not—we're not doing the doom spiral thing today. Can you just like, I dunno, let yourself be happy for five seconds? [Sigh] You've earned this.

Character 1: I am happy. Just tired.

528 Character 2: Yeah, I bet you're—actually, when's the last time you actually slept? Like really slept, not that weird couch nap thing you do.

Character 1: Tuesday, maybe. Or Monday.

529 Character 2: Okay that's—Jesus, that's not okay. You're gonna crash so hard. But also like, I get it? The adrenaline must be absolutely insane right now.

Character 1: The reviews are mostly positive. One guy said it changed his workflow completely.

530 Character 2: See? See, there it is! [Laugh] You're trying so hard not to smile right now but I can hear it. That's gotta feel amazing, having strangers actually use your thing.

Character 1: Yeah. It's weird seeing it out there.

531 Character 2: Weird how? Like scary-weird or like—wait, are you having one of those moments where it doesn't feel real? Because that's totally normal, y'know?

Character 1: Both, I guess. Mostly it just feels... done.

532 Character 2: Done for now, maybe. But knowing you? You're probably already thinking about version two, aren't you? God, you're such a—you're impossible, but I'm so fucking proud of you.

Script: c2cff8cc_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I saw your pitch presentation.

533 Character 2: Oh. Um, yeah, I meant to tell you about that—I know how it looks, but it's not like I just stole it from you. We worked on that together, remember?

Character 1: We brainstormed together. You pitched it alone.

534 Character 2: Because you weren't—look, you weren't even gonna be there! The opportunity came up and I had to make a call. Was I supposed to just let it pass?

Character 1: You could've mentioned my name.

535 Character 2: I did! I literally said "we" like five times, but okay, maybe I should've been more [sigh] explicit about it. But honestly, you're acting like I planned this whole thing behind your back.

Character 1: Didn't you?

536 Character 2: That's—no. No, I didn't. Come on, we've been bouncing ideas off each other for months. I thought that's what we do, y'know? Share stuff, build on it together.

Character 1: Together. Not you taking credit for everything.

537 Character 2: I'm not taking credit for—okay okay, fine. Maybe I got carried away in the moment. But you gotta understand, they put me on the spot and I just... ran with it.

Character 1: My exact framework. My examples.

538 Character 2: Because we developed them tog—[frustrated laugh] you know what? Yeah. Some of those were yours. But some were mine too, and you're conveniently forgetting that part.

Character 1: The core concept was mine.

539 Character 2: Was it though? 'Cause I remember us sitting at that coffee shop, both of us throwing out ideas, and it kinda just... emerged. I mean, I'm not saying you didn't contribute, but—

Character 1: Stop.

540 Character 2: No, wait—I'm trying to explain here. You're mad, I get it, but you're also not being fair about what actually happened. This was collaborative until suddenly it's not?

Character 1: It stopped being collaborative when you went solo.

541 Character 2: I went solo because I had to! And honestly? [scoff] I'm getting pretty frustrated that you can't see that. Like, I'm sorry I didn't handle it perfectly, but I'm not gonna apologize for taking an opportunity.

Character 1: Right. Got it.

542 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Look look, I know I messed up the communication part, okay? I should've told you first. But acting like I'm some kinda thief when we've literally always shared ideas... that hurts too, y'know?

Script: 34743797_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So you told everyone else but me.

543 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's not even true. I told like, two people, and honestly? I wasn't ready to tell anyone, but they kinda figured it out on their own.

Character 1: Right.

544 Character 2: Don't do that. Don't just—look, I know you're pissed, but you're acting like I deliberately excluded you when that's not what happened. I wasn't ready to talk about it with you specifically because I knew you'd—[sigh] I knew you'd make it into this whole thing.

Character 1: This whole thing? You mean caring?

545 Character 2: No, I mean—ugh, that's not what I meant and you know it. I mean you'd wanna fix everything immediately and sometimes I just need to, like, sit with stuff before I'm ready for that kind of help, y'know?

Character 1: I wouldn't have pushed.

546 Character 2: You literally always push. Always. And usually that's—fine, whatever, but this time I needed space and I'm not gonna apologize for taking it.

Character 1: Three months. You needed three months of space from me.

547 Character 2: It wasn't about you! God, why does everything have to be—[frustrated laugh] I was dealing with my own shit, okay? And yeah, maybe I should've said something sooner, but I wasn't ready. I wasn't.

Character 1: But you were ready to tell Marcus. And Jen.

548 Character 2: They found out by accident! Marcus saw me at the clinic and Jen—she basically cornered me when I was crying in my car. It's not like I planned some secret meeting without you.

Character 1: You could've told me after.

549 Character 2: And said what? "Hey, so I've been going through this massive thing but please don't ask questions or try to help"? Come on. You would've been at my door with like, soup and self-help books within the hour.

Character 1: So what? That's what friends do.

550 Character 2: Yeah, well, sometimes—sometimes I don't want that. Sometimes I need to figure things out without someone hovering, and I'm allowed to do that. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings but I'm not sorry for needing boundaries.

Character 1: Boundaries. That's what we're calling this.

551 Character 2: What else would you—okay okay, fine. You wanna be mad? Be mad. But I was drowning, alright? [quieter] And I knew if I told you, you'd try to save me before I even figured out if I wanted to be saved.

Character 1: I just wanted to be there.

552 Character 2: I know. I know you did. And maybe I should've—I dunno, handled it better. But I was barely handling it at all, so... yeah. That's all I got.

Script: 7bd5ecd1_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You canceled my interview.

553 Character 2: I didn't—okay, yeah, I called them, but only because you were having that panic attack last week and I thought—I was trying to help. You were literally crying about how you weren't ready.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

554 Character 2: Look look, I get that you're mad, but you were—you couldn't even breathe when you talked about it. I was worried about you. [Sigh] Maybe I should've asked first, but honestly, you weren't exactly in a state to make decisions.

Character 1: I'm always "not in a state" according to you.

555 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not what I meant and you know it. I've watched you push yourself into these situations that make you miserable, and I just... I dunno, I thought I was being a good friend.

Character 1: By deciding what's best for me?

556 Character 2: By caring enough to [frustrated laugh] actually do something when you're struggling instead of just watching you fall apart. But fine, apparently that makes me the bad guy here.

Character 1: You told my mom about therapy too.

557 Character 2: Because you needed—okay okay, I see how that looks now, but you kept saying you wanted to go and then backing out, and your mom has good insurance, so I thought... I mean, was it really that terrible that she knows?

Character 1: Yes.

558 Character 2: Well I didn't—I didn't know it was gonna be this huge thing. You talk about wanting help all the time, and then you never actually... whatever. I'm sorry I tried to make it easier for you.

Character 1: You don't get to be mad at me right now.

559 Character 2: I'm not mad, I'm just—I'm frustrated because you're acting like everything I did was some kind of... control thing, when really I was just trying to—y'know what, forget it.

Character 1: No, finish. Trying to what?

560 Character 2: Trying to help someone who won't help themselves. There, I said it. And maybe that's—maybe that's not my job or whatever, but watching you stuck in the same patterns over and over is honestly exhausting sometimes.

Character 1: Then stop watching.

561 Character 2: That's not... [Groan] See, this is what you do. I'm not saying I wanna stop being your friend, I'm saying that maybe—just maybe—you could try to see that I wasn't coming from a bad place here.

Character 1: Good intentions don't fix anything.

562 Character 2: No, but they should count for something, right? Like, I messed up, fine, but you're treating me like I'm some kind of—I dunno, like I'm your enemy instead of someone who actually gives a shit about you.

563 SCENARIO: trying to decide if they should buy the extended warranty

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay so, um, do I need the extended warranty? I mean, it's— it's just a toaster, right? But, uh, but they're really pushing it here, like, "protect your investment" and all that. Investment? It's forty bucks.

[slightly skeptical]

Three years for, um, for twelve dollars extra. That's not— that's not terrible, I guess? But like, what even breaks on a toaster? The, uh, the heating things? The cord? [hmm] I've never actually had a toaster break on me.

[thinking out loud]

But then again, Murphy's Law, right? The second I don't get the warranty, it's gonna— it's gonna just die. Like, immediately. Day after the regular warranty runs out, boom, dead toaster. [sigh] That would be so typical.

[faster, slightly anxious]

Wait, but what if I move? Am I gonna— am I gonna keep the receipt? Will I even remember I have a warranty? I can barely remember to, um, to pay my phone bill half the time.

[resigned, trailing off]

You know what, twelve bucks. It's twelve bucks. If it makes them stop asking me about it... [exhale] Fine. Sure. Let's protect the investment.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: c393601a | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [defensively] Eight percent is perfectly reasonable for mediocre service. [getting louder] She forgot my water twice and mixed up our appetizers! [Scoff] I'm not subsidizing incompetence just because society expects me to throw money around like confetti.

564 Character 2: [mortified whisper] Jeremy, please keep your voice down. [urgently] Everyone's staring at us, and she's standing right there by the kitchen. [Nervous laugh] Can't you just leave fifteen percent like a normal person for once in your life?

Character 1: [smugly] Normal people don't understand economics. [slower pace] If everyone tipped properly based on actual service quality, [triumphantly] maybe these restaurants would train their staff better instead of expecting customers to supplement their payroll expenses.

565 Character 2: [exasperated] She's a single mom working doubles! [pleading tone] I talked to her last week when you were in the bathroom. [Heavy sigh] Your "economics lesson" means her kid might not get new school shoes this month.

Character 1: [dismissively] That's emotional manipulation, not my problem. [matter-of-fact] Her financial planning isn't my responsibility. [Dry chuckle] Besides, I left her five whole dollars on a sixty-dollar check—that's generous enough for forgetting my ranch dressing.

566 Character 2: [through gritted teeth] Five dollars? [increasingly agitated] You spent forty dollars on that bottle of wine alone! [Bitter laugh] But God forbid you leave an extra three bucks for someone who served us for ninety minutes straight.

Character 1: [condescendingly slow] The wine was an investment in our evening's enjoyment. [sharply] Tips are optional gratuities, hence the name. [Snort] If she wanted guaranteed income, she should've chosen a career with a proper salary structure, shouldn't she?

567 Character 2: [quietly seething] You know what? [building volume] I'm done being embarrassed every single time we go out. [Shaky breath] This is the last dinner I'm having with you until you learn basic human decency and social awareness.

Character 1: [mockingly] Oh, how dramatic! [in disbelief] You're ending our friendship over tipping culture? [Hollow laugh] Fine, go ahead and enable this broken system where customers are guilted into paying employees instead of their actual employers doing it.

568 Character 2: [firmly] I'm going back inside. [determined] I'm leaving her a proper tip and apologizing for your behavior. [Disgusted sigh] And yes, I'm ending our restaurant outings because I can't stand watching you humiliate hardworking people anymore.

Character 1: [indignantly] Humiliate? [rising pitch] I'm the one being humiliated by your virtue signaling! [Harsh laugh] Go ahead, waste your money if it makes you feel morally superior to everyone who understands basic mathematics and principles.

569 Character 2: [coldly] It's not virtue signaling, Jeremy. [measured tone] It's called not being a complete asshole to service workers. [Tired exhale] You make six figures but act like leaving twenty percent will bankrupt you somehow.

Character 1: [defensively fast] My income is irrelevant to this discussion! [slowly, deliberately] A tip should reflect service quality, period. [Sharp intake] Just because I earn well doesn't mean I should subsidize every sob story with a notepad.

570 Character 2: [incredulous] Sob story? [voice cracking] She's a human being trying to make rent! [Frustrated groan] You spent two hundred dollars on those concert tickets last week but calculate tips down to the penny like Scrooge.

Character 1: [pompously] Concert tickets provide lasting memories and cultural enrichment. [dismissive tone] Overtipping provides nothing but enabling a flawed system. [Clicking tongue] You clearly don't understand the difference between worthwhile investments and throwing money away on principle.

571 Character 2: [sarcastically sweet] Oh, I understand perfectly. [building anger] You value your entertainment over people's livelihoods. [Dry laugh] That waitress will definitely remember you too—as the cheap jerk from table twelve who stiffed her.

Character 1: [irritated] Stiffed her? [louder, defensive] I left something, didn't I? [Exasperated huff] In most countries, tipping isn't even expected—America's the only place where customers are emotionally blackmailed into paying restaurant wages directly.

572 Character 2: [wearily] But we're not in other countries, are we? [firmly] We're here, where servers make two dollars an hour. [Deep breath] I'm done arguing—enjoy eating alone from now on, because I won't be joining.

Character 1: [bitterly] Fine by me! [quick tempo] I'll save money on both the tip and your overpriced entrees. [Sardonic chuckle] Maybe I'll find dining companions who appreciate fiscal responsibility instead of bleeding-heart liberalism at every meal.

573 Character 2: [walking away] Fiscal responsibility? [disgusted whisper] You're just cheap, Jeremy. [Hollow laugh] And lonely—because nobody wants to be seen in public with someone who treats people like they're beneath them. Goodbye.

Character 1: I was telling you about my dad's diagnosis.

575 Character 2: Oh god. Oh god, I know. I'm—I'm literally the worst person alive right now. It wasn't—I wasn't laughing at that, I promise you. My brain just like... short-circuited? [nervous laugh] Sorry, that's not funny either.

577 Character 2: That's not—okay, yes, but not like that. Not like I didn't wanna hear it or anything. I just didn't know what to say and my body just—it just reacted before my brain could catch up, y'know? I'm so, so sorry.

Character 1: I needed you to be there for me.

578 Character 2: I know. I know and I completely failed you and I—[sigh] honestly, I've been replaying it in my head all night. Like, the look on your face when I... god, I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

579 Character 2: I really wanna fix this. I mean, I dunno if I even can, but like—you're one of my best friends and I just... I reacted wrong. Sometimes I laugh when I'm supposed to cry, it's this weird thing I've always—that's not an excuse though.

Character 1: It's not.

580 Character 2: No, it's really not. And I should've—I should've just shut up and hugged you or something. Literally anything would've been better than what I did. Your dad's gonna be okay though, right? I mean—sorry, is it okay to ask that?

Character 1: I don't know. That's what's scary.

581 Character 2: Yeah... yeah, of course it is. [quieter] I'm really, really sorry about your dad. And about being the world's worst friend when you needed me.

Character 1: You're not the world's worst friend. Just... really bad timing.

582 Character 2: The absolute worst timing. But I'm—I'm here now, okay? Like, actually here. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. I promise I won't laugh or make it weird or—I'll just listen. I can do that.

Character 1: Okay. Maybe we can talk tomorrow.

583 Character 2: Yeah, tomorrow. Definitely. And um... thank you. For like, not completely writing me off. I know I don't deserve—just, thank you. And I really am sorry.

Oh my God, you should have seen this morning. So you know how Sarah's been planning this wedding for like two years? Every detail perfect, outdoor ceremony, the whole thing. And I wake up and it's just— [sigh] it's pouring. Like absolutely dumping rain.

[stressed]

And Sarah is, she's just losing it, right? Like completely falling apart. The tent's not gonna fit everyone, half the decorations are gonna be ruined, and I'm trying to be supportive but honestly I'm thinking this is gonna be a disaster. Like a total, soggy disaster.

[annoyed]

The flowers are all droopy, people are showing up with umbrellas and wet shoes, and I'm just— I'm standing there in my heels getting soaked thinking this poor girl, you know? This is supposed to be her perfect day and it's just...

[quieter] [realizing]

But then— okay wait, so they're doing the ceremony and I actually look around for the first time instead of just complaining in my head about my wet dress, and...

[amazed] [warm]

It was like— it was magical. The rain on the tent sounded like this soft drumming, and all the string lights were reflecting in the puddles, and everyone looked so cozy and intimate under the tent. Like we were all sharing this beautiful secret moment.

[deflated]

But then I checked the weather this morning and it's like... [groan] it's supposed to rain. Like actual rain, not just cloudy or whatever.

I was so— ugh, I was so looking forward to this, you know? I need this beach day, I need the sun and the waves and just like... not thinking about work for five seconds.

[frustrated]

And I already told everyone I was going, posted about it yesterday, got my hopes all— I don't know why I even checked the stupid weather app, sometimes it's better to just be surprised, right?

Wait, hold on though. Let me... let me look at this again because— okay, so it says rain in the morning but then... oh wait.

Oh! It clears up by noon! Like completely clears up, sunny the rest of the day.

[excited again] [relieved]

Okay so we can still do this! We just go later, like leave at eleven-thirty instead of nine. Actually that's— that's probably better anyway, gives me time to actually wake up properly.

And of course it had to happen today when I have like three meetings back to back. I'm sitting there trying to look professional and I'm just like internally screaming because every time I move it's like— ow, ow, ow.

Wait, let me just— let me try stretching it out real quick while we're talking. Maybe if I just roll my shoulders back and— oh, oh wait, I think I feel something...

[casual] [light laugh]

So you know how sometimes your stomach makes those weird noises? Like, I'm sitting in that dead silent meeting this morning and my stomach just goes *grrrrowwwwl* — super loud, right in the middle of Johnson's presentation. [chuckling] I'm trying not to laugh because, you know, it's like my body's just announcing to everyone that I skipped breakfast.

But then like an hour later, I'm at my desk and it happens again. Same exact sound, same spot — right here under my ribs. And I'm thinking, okay, that's weird, it's not really a hungry sound, you know?

[slightly concerned]

So now I'm actually paying attention to it, and it keeps happening. Like every twenty minutes or so. [pause] And it's not just hunger, it's this weird... gurgling? But not normal stomach gurgling.

[more worried]

I started googling it — I know, I know, never google symptoms — but like, what if it's something with my gallbladder? Or my liver? [nervous laugh] My uncle had liver problems and—

[anxious] [talking faster]

Oh god, and now that I'm thinking about it, I've been kind of tired lately. And isn't that a symptom of like... everything bad? [sharp exhale] What if I've been ignoring something serious this whole time?

Oh my god, I have to tell you about this apartment! I finally signed the lease today and it's— it's perfect, like everything I wanted. The kitchen has this huge island and there's so much light, and the bedroom actually fits a queen bed without looking like a sardine can.

[excited] [rushed]

And the rent is like way better than I expected for that area, which I was like, okay this is too good to be true, but the landlord seems legit and— yeah, I'm just so relieved to finally have a place, you know?

[uncertainty creeping in]

I mean, the neighborhood is... I don't know, I drove through it at like two in the afternoon on a Tuesday, so it's probably not, um... it's probably not representative of what it's actually like to live there, right?

[worried]

Like what if it gets sketchy at night? What if the neighbors are awful and there's like loud music until three AM or— God, what if I made a huge mistake? I didn't even meet any of the other tenants.

[surprised] [brightening]

Oh wait, actually— there's someone at my door right now, hold on... 

[warm] [relieved]

590 SCENARIO: Lightheartedly talking about a recipe substitution they made, then tasting the food while talking, then realizing it's inedible, ending in cooking failure despair

==================================================

[casual] [light]

So you know that lemon cake recipe I was telling you about? The one from my mom's cookbook? Well, I didn't have any lemons, but I had limes, so I figured— you know, citrus is citrus, right? [chuckle] How different could it be?

[conversational]

I mean, lime cake sounds fancy anyway. Like something you'd get at a trendy bakery for twelve dollars a slice. And the batter looked pretty good, maybe a little— well, maybe a little greener than usual, but that's just the lime, obviously.

[still light] [slightly proud]

So it's cooling on the counter right now, and honestly? It smells amazing. [sniff] Like, really tropical and— oh, you know what, let me just try a little piece of this corner here...

[faltering]

Hm. That's... that's very... [pause] Wait, let me try another bite. Maybe I just got a weird spot or—

[realization dawning]

Oh. Oh no. [groan] This is— this tastes like I baked a margarita. But like, a bad margarita. A really, really bitter margarita that someone left soap in.

[dismay building]

I used the whole bag of limes! Eight limes! Do you know how much limes cost? [frustrated exhale] And I was gonna bring this to Sarah's party tomorrow!

[spiraling] [defeated]

I can't bake! I literally cannot bake! My mom makes this recipe blindfolded and I turned it into inedible citrus cement! [whimper] What am I supposed to bring now? Store-bought cookies like a failure?

==================================================

Ugh, so I'm looking at my history test from yesterday and I'm like— I'm so annoyed because I got this one question wrong about the Treaty of Versailles, and I know I studied that like crazy. Like I literally made flashcards for that whole unit.

[irritated]

And it's asking about the year it was signed, and I put 1919, which is right, but apparently Professor Chen marked it wrong? Like what the hell, you know? That's such an easy point to lose over nothing.

[getting worked up]

I was gonna go to his office hours and be like, look, this is clearly correct, I don't know what— [sigh] I hate having to argue about grades, it's so awkward, but like I earned those points, you know?

[confused] [trailing off]

Wait, let me just... let me look at this again because I want to make sure I'm reading it right before I go marching into his office and...

[surprised]

Oh. Oh wait, that's— that's not an X. That's like a really badly drawn checkmark. [half laugh] Oh my god, I think he actually marked it correct?

[sheepish] [relieved]

So I'm walking back from lunch today and I hear these voices coming from the break room, right? And they're like, clearly in the middle of some heated discussion. You know how it is when you accidentally walk into drama.

[conversational] [light laugh]

I wasn't trying to eavesdrop or anything, but they were being pretty loud about it. Something about someone being "unprofessional" and "not meeting expectations." Classic office gossip stuff.

[a bit more interested]

But then I hear Sarah's voice, and I'm like, oh, that's my boss. And she's going back and forth with someone from HR. And I'm thinking, wow, someone's really in trouble, you know?

[realization dawning]

Wait... [pause] they just said my name. Did they just— they're talking about my presentation from yesterday. Oh god, they're talking about me.

[growing anxiety]

"Unprofessional"? What does that even mean? I wore a blazer! I had charts! [nervous laugh] What was unprofessional about— oh no, was it the joke I made? Was that inappropriate?

How long have they been discussing this? Who else knows? [sharp exhale] Are they gonna call me in later? Am I getting fired over a PowerPoint?

==================================================

Oh, so I was telling my mom about our spare key situation yesterday. You know how we keep one hidden outside? I was all proud, like, "Oh yeah, we've got the perfect spot, no one would ever think to look there."

[conversational] [slight chuckle]

It's under this fake rock thing behind the big planter on the side of the house. Like, you'd have to really be looking for it, you know? I was feeling pretty smart about the whole setup.

[matter-of-fact]

But then after I hung up, I thought, you know what, I should probably just double-check that it's still there. Make sure the rain didn't wash it away or whatever. [light laugh] Just being responsible.

[a bit confused]

So I go outside and I'm looking around the planter, moving the fake rock, and... it's not there. Like, the rock is there, but no key underneath. Which is weird because I could have sworn—

[more concerned]

Wait, when did I last actually see it? [pause] I mean, I know we put it there when we moved in, but that was... [trailing off] that was eight months ago.

[growing anxiety]

Oh god. [sharp exhale] What if someone's been watching us? What if they took it weeks ago and I just never checked? They could have copied it! They could have been in our house!

[annoyed]

And I'm like, this is the third store I've tried this week, what is happening? So I'm standing there getting all worked up because my skin's been breaking out and I really need this specific one, not some random substitute.

[irritated]

The whole beauty section was picked over and I'm just like, why didn't I order this online? I'm being so dramatic but I was genuinely getting mad at like— at the universe or whatever. [sigh]

[still annoyed but softer]

So finally I ask this employee if they have any in the back, and she's like super nice about it, goes to check even though I'm probably being obviously cranky about the whole thing.

[surprised] [pleased]

And she comes back with one! Like the last one they had, just sitting in some shipment box that hadn't been put out yet.

[warm] [slightly embarrassed]

She was so sweet about it too, and I realized I'd been like— I'd been taking my weird week out on this random stock situation. [small laugh] Sometimes you just need someone to be helpful to remind you that things work out, you know?

[frustrated] [tired]

I'm like trying to sleep and it's just "woof woof woof" every two seconds. I was so close to just, like, going over there and being like "can you please control your animal?" But I didn't want to be that neighbor, you know?

[annoyed]

And it's not even like— it's not like there's anything happening outside. The dog is just... existing and barking about it. For hours. I couldn't even focus on my coffee this morning, I was so [groan] wound up about it.

[slightly calmer] [confused]

But then like twenty minutes ago, the neighbor actually came over and— wait, someone's at my door again, hold on.

[surprised] [warm]

Oh wow, okay so it's her again, and she brought me these like homemade chocolate chip cookies? She was like so apologetic about the dog, apparently he gets anxious when she leaves for work and she had no idea how loud he was being.

[guilty] [soft]

God, now I feel terrible for being so angry about it. Like, she clearly feels bad and these cookies smell amazing. She even asked for my number so she can text me if it happens again.

[hurt]

She said my argument was "unfocused" and that I was "hiding behind jargon instead of making clear points." Like, ouch? I spent three weeks on that chapter and she just... [sigh] she basically said it read like I didn't understand my own research.

[defensive] [angry]

And I was so mad, like who does she think she is? I mean I get that she's the expert but she didn't have to be so— so harsh about it. I was ready to just, I don't know, switch advisors or something.

[quieter] [uncertain]

But then I was rereading her notes just now and... um, wait. Actually some of this stuff she's pointing out, it's like— oh. 

[realizing] 

Oh no, she's right. This paragraph here, I literally have no idea what I was trying to say. And this whole section is just me using fancy words because I thought it sounded academic, but it's actually... it's actually nonsense.

Wait, hold on. Media company... forty-seven dollars... [pause] Oh god, is that— did I sign up for that documentary streaming thing?

I was, uh, I was checking it this morning and it's like— it's not all gross and, um, crusty anymore. [light laugh] Sorry, that's, uh, that's disgusting, but you know what I mean? It just feels, um, it feels normal again.

Actually, let me just— [pause] yeah, it's definitely, um, it's definitely healing up nice. Barely even, uh, barely even hurts when I— when I touch it like that, so—

Wait. Hang on. [sharp exhale] Oh no, that's— that's not... that doesn't look right. It's like, um, it's redder than it was? And now it's, uh— [groan] oh god, it's tingling again.

I just— I just touched it. With my finger. The same finger I've been, um, I've been touching everything with today. My phone, the, uh, the coffee cup at work that I— [anxious laugh] that I shared with Jake.

Alright, so we pour the milk and— [pause] huh. That's, um, that's not the right color. That's not— is that supposed to look like that? I mean, milk is supposed to be white, right, not like, uh, not chunky and weird and—

Oh. Oh no. [tsk] That's— that's definitely bad milk. Like, really bad milk. I can smell it from here, which is, um, which is not a good sign. Not a good sign at all.

I mean, I could switch lines, but then— but then that's always when this one starts moving again, right? That's like, um, that's like a universal law or something. The second you switch, your old line becomes the fast one.

[contemplative]

Although, honestly, that lady over there looks like she's— she's moving pretty good. Her line's definitely— wait, no, she just stopped too. [tsk] Never mind.

[flat]

Okay, so I guess we're all just, um, we're all just standing here now. Living our best grocery store life. This is fine. This is, uh, this is totally how I wanted to spend my Saturday.

609 SCENARIO: noticing they have something in their teeth

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh god, what is— there's something, um, there's definitely something stuck in my— [tsk] right in the front tooth. Of course. Of course it's right in the, uh, the most visible spot possible.

[slightly annoyed]

Was it the, um— was it the poppy seed bagel? I mean, that's— that's gotta be it, right? Those things are like, uh, like little dental disasters waiting to happen. But I ate that like, what, two hours ago?

[working through it]

Okay, so I can, um, I can try to get it with my tongue, but that's— that's not really working, is it? [hmm] And I don't have, uh, I don't have any floss or— wait, do I have a toothpick? Let me just—

[slightly panicked]

Oh no, how long have I been walking around like this? Did I talk to— did I talk to Sarah in the elevator? [groan] I totally did, and she was being all, um, all smiley and I thought she was just being nice, but maybe she was trying not to, uh, not to stare at my—

[resigned]

Right. Bathroom. I need to just, um, just go deal with this like a normal person instead of, uh, instead of standing here picking at my teeth like some kind of—

610 SCENARIO: debating whether to ask for extra napkins

==================================================

[muttering to self]

Okay, so, um— I should probably grab some more napkins, right? Like, this is— this is definitely not enough for, uh, for what I'm about to do to this burrito. [nervous laugh] I mean, look at this thing, it's like, it's like a food bomb waiting to go off.

[slightly hesitant]

But do I just— do I just walk up there and ask? Because the guy already gave me, um, he gave me like three, and I don't want him to think I'm some kind of napkin hoarder or something. [hmm] Although, I mean, three napkins for a burrito this size is kind of— that's kind of insulting, actually.

[building confidence]

You know what, no, I'm— I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask. It's not weird to want adequate napkin coverage for a meal. That's just, uh, that's just good planning. [pause] Right? Right.

[wavering again]

But what if he— what if he gives me that look? Like the "oh, this person again" look? I don't— I don't think I can handle that kind of judgment right now. [sigh] Over napkins. This is, um, this is what my life has become.

[resigned but determined]

Okay, okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna go for it. Worst case scenario, I eat this thing like a cave person and, uh, and wash my hands really thoroughly after. [under breath] Here goes nothing.

611 SCENARIO: deciding whether an email sounds too passive aggressive

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I need to, um— I need to send this email, but does this sound... I don't know, does this sound weird? "I hope this finds you well." That's— that's normal, right?

[slightly uncertain]

Actually, wait, let me— let me read this again. "As per our previous conversation..." Hmm. [tsk] That sounds, um, that sounds kind of snotty? Like, "as per"— who says "as per"? I mean, I do, apparently, but—

[faster, second-guessing]

Maybe I should just say "like we talked about" instead? But that's too casual for, uh, for Janet from accounting. She's very— she's very proper. Very, um, very email-formal.

[drawn out, conflicted]

But "I wanted to follow up" sounds like I'm being pushy, right? Like, aggressive? I don't want to be that person who's like, constantly— constantly poking people about stuff.

[resigned, quieter]

You know what? I'm overthinking this. It's just— it's just an email about the quarterly reports. Janet's not gonna, um, she's not gonna psychoanalyze my word choices. [exhale] Probably.

[decisive but still uncertain]

Okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna send it. It's fine. It's, uh, it's professional. That's... that's what matters, right?

612 SCENARIO: realizing they left their loyalty card at home

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh, come on. Come on, where is— I know I have it somewhere. The, um, the little card thing for— [sigh] I literally just need the stupid loyalty card and I— wait, did I even bring my wallet?

[slightly panicked]

Okay, okay, wallet's here, that's good. But the card is— it's not in the, uh, it's not in the little slot where I usually— [groan] Oh no. Oh no no no, I think I left it on the kitchen counter.

[resigned but still searching]

Maybe it's loose in here somewhere? Like, maybe it just, um, maybe it fell out or something? Let me just— no, that's a receipt. That's another receipt. Why do I have so many— [tsk] this is just grocery receipts from like three weeks ago.

[defeated]

Yeah, no, it's definitely at home. Sitting right there on the counter next to the, uh, next to the coffee maker where I left it like an idiot. [exhale] Great planning, really.

[brightening slightly]

But wait, can't I just, um— don't they have like an app now? Or I could just give them my phone number, right? That's— that's a thing they do now.
