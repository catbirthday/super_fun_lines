Character 1: You said you loved my painting.

446 Character 2: I—okay, I did say that, but it's not—it's not that simple, alright? I mean, I do like it! I just... maybe not as much as I said I did?

Character 1: So you lied.

447 Character 2: No no no, not lied, I just—I exaggerated? A little? You were so excited and I didn't wanna—I couldn't just tell you it wasn't my thing, y'know? [nervous laugh] That would've been cruel.

Character 1: And lying to my face wasn't?

448 Character 2: That's—that's not what I meant to do. I swear, I was trying to be supportive! Like, you worked so hard on it and I could see how proud you were and I just... I dunno, I got caught up in the moment.

Character 1: I asked for your honest opinion. Specifically.

449 Character 2: I know, I know you did. And I should've—god, I should've just been straight with you. But honestly? I was scared, okay? You're kinda intimidating when it comes to your art and I didn't—[sigh] I didn't wanna disappoint you.

Character 1: I heard you telling Marcus what you really thought.

450 Character 2: Oh. Oh shit. I—that was... okay, I can explain that. I was venting, and I didn't mean—wait wait, that sounds bad. Um. I wasn't trying to talk behind your back or anything, Marcus just asked and I was being stupid.

Character 1: "Amateur." That's what you called it.

451 Character 2: I didn't—I mean, technically I said "amateurish" which is—no, sorry, that's not better. Christ. Look, I'm an idiot, alright? A complete idiot who doesn't know anything about art anyway so why does my opinion even matter?

Character 1: It mattered to me.

452 Character 2: I know. [quieter] I know it did. And that's—that's why I feel so terrible right now. Like, genuinely sick to my stomach. You trusted me to be honest and I just... I blew it. I completely blew it.

Character 1: I showed it to galleries based on your "feedback."

453 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, I didn't—you didn't tell me you were gonna do that! I mean, not that it's your fault, obviously it's not, but I—if I'd known you were gonna... shit. I'm so sorry. Like, so incredibly sorry.

Character 1: Yeah. Well.

454 Character 2: Please don't—please don't hate me? I know I messed up, I really really do, but I wanna make this right. Whatever you need me to do, I'll do it. You want me to call those galleries? Tell them I'm an idiot who knows nothing?

Character 1: That's not... no. Just be honest with me next time.

455 Character 2: Yes. Absolutely. I promise—and I mean actually promise this time—I will never, ever do that again. Even if it's hard, even if I think it might hurt your feelings... you deserve the truth. [pause] Your friendship means everything to me, y'know? I just—I really hope I haven't ruined it.

Script: f5b073d1_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I saw the pictures from Saturday.

456 Character 2: Oh. Um, okay—look, before you freak out, it wasn't even a party. It was literally just like five people who happened to be at Jake's place, and it just kinda...happened.

Character 1: Right. It just happened.

457 Character 2: Yeah, it did actually. We were gonna watch the game and then—I dunno, people started showing up and [sigh] I know how it looks, but it wasn't some planned thing where I deliberately didn't invite you.

Character 1: Five people is pretty planned.

458 Character 2: No, that's—that's not how it went down. Jake texted me last minute, like an hour before, and I was already in the neighborhood. I mean, was I supposed to be like "hold on, let me invite everyone I know"?

Character 1: You could've texted.

459 Character 2: Okay okay, maybe I could've, but honestly? You've been super busy lately and you literally told me last week you were burnt out on social stuff. So I figured—wrongly, apparently—that you wouldn't even wanna come.

Character 1: That's not your call to make.

460 Character 2: Fine, you're right, it's not. But you're acting like I'm this terrible friend when I was actually trying to respect what you said. [frustrated laugh] I can't win here.

Character 1: Everyone else was there. Lauren, Mike, even Sam.

461 Character 2: Sam was Jake's roommate's plus one! I didn't even know he was gonna be there until I showed up. Look look, I get that you're hurt, and maybe I should've—I probably should've texted you. But this feels kinda unfair.

Character 1: Unfair? Seriously?

462 Character 2: Yeah, unfair. Because you're making it sound like we all got together and decided to exclude you, which is not what happened. At all. And honestly? You've bailed on the last three things we invited you to.

Character 1: That's different.

463 Character 2: How? How is that different? You don't show up when we invite you, but then get mad when—okay, y'know what, that came out wrong. [groan] I'm not trying to attack you here.

Character 1: Sure sounds like it.

464 Character 2: Well I'm—I'm frustrated too, okay? Because I feel like no matter what I do lately, you're disappointed in me. And yeah, maybe I messed up this time, but you're not exactly making it easy to apologize.

Character 1: You haven't actually apologized.

465 Character 2: You're right. I haven't. Because honestly? Part of me doesn't think I should have to. But I am sorry you're hurt. I am. I just—I wish you could see that it wasn't about you.

Script: 5b868593_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Saw the photos you posted.

466 Character 2: Oh! Oh no, wait—which ones? I posted like a bunch from last night and I thought they were all really cute! Did I—did I miss something?

Character 1: The ones where I look like I'm having a stroke.

467 Character 2: That's not—okay, you don't look like that at all! I mean, maybe the lighting was a little weird but I honestly thought you looked great! I wouldn't have posted them if I didn't think—

Character 1: Delete them.

468 Character 2: Yeah, yeah of course, I'm literally doing it right now. [nervous laugh] I'm so sorry, I should've asked you first. I just got excited because we haven't hung out in forever and I wanted to—but that's not an excuse.

Character 1: Three hundred people saw me looking like that.

469 Character 2: I know, I know, I'm the worst. Like genuinely, I feel terrible. I was just—I dunno, I was going through them really quick this morning and I thought they were fine but clearly I wasn't paying attention and that's on me.

Character 1: You looked perfect in every single one.

470 Character 2: That's not—I mean, that wasn't intentional! I swear I wasn't trying to make myself look better than you or anything like that. You know I would never—[groan] okay, I can see how it looks though.

Character 1: Right.

471 Character 2: No no no, please don't be mad. I'm deleting them right now, see? Gone. And I'll—I'll post that really good one of you from dinner last week instead, the one where you're laughing? You look amazing in that one.

Character 1: That's not the point.

472 Character 2: You're right, you're totally right. The point is I should've checked with you first. I just—I get so carried away with posting stuff immediately and I don't think about—god, I'm such an idiot sometimes.

Character 1: You could've at least warned me.

473 Character 2: I know. I should've texted you or—or shown them to you before I posted anything. That's like, basic friend etiquette and I completely failed. I'm really, really sorry. [sigh] I honestly didn't mean to make you feel bad.

Character 1: I had my ex comment asking if I was okay.

474 Character 2: Oh my god, no. No no no, that's—that's awful. I'm so sorry. Listen, I'll post something right now about how my phone camera was being weird or—wait, that sounds stupid. Um, what if I just post a bunch of really good ones of you?

Character 1: Just... ask next time. Please.

475 Character 2: I will. I promise I will, every single time. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna go through and delete any other ones where you don't look perfect, okay? Like, I mean it. I really am sorry. You know I love you, right?

476 SCENARIO: realizing they scheduled two things at the same time

==================================================

[muttering to self]

Okay, so I've got, um, I've got the dentist at three, and then— wait. Wait wait wait. [pause] Didn't I tell Sarah I'd meet her at, uh, at three thirty? For coffee?

[slightly panicked]

Oh no. Oh no no no, that's— that's not gonna work. The dentist is gonna be, like, at least an hour, right? I mean, it's just a cleaning, but they always— they always run late, and then there's the, um, the fluoride thing, and—

[thinking out loud]

Okay, so if I— if I text Sarah now, maybe we can, uh, maybe we can push it to four? Four thirty? But didn't she say she had that, um, that thing with her mom later? [groan] Why do I do this to myself?

[resigned]

I should probably just— I should just call the dentist and see if they can, uh, if they can move me earlier. Or later. I don't know. [sigh] This is what I get for, um, for scheduling things on my phone at like midnight when I can't think straight.

[trailing off]

Unless Sarah's free tomorrow instead... but then that messes up my whole—

Script: 8fde8a44 | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [trembling] It's over, Mary. [Sobbing breath] The guns have stopped—can you hear it? [in disbelief] After four years of nothing but thunder and screaming, there's just... silence now. The war is finally done.

477 Character 2: [whispering] I can't believe it. [Shaky exhale] All those boys we couldn't save, Thomas with his letters from home still unopened. [louder, breaking] What do we tell their mothers now? That it ended too late?

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Too late. [quietly] Everything feels too late now, doesn't it? [voice cracking] Yesterday I held Private Collins' hand while he died, told him he'd see another Christmas. The armistice was just hours away.

478 Character 2: [angrily] Hours! [Choking sob] We lost twelve men this morning alone—for what? [in a whisper] They knew it was coming at eleven o'clock. The generals knew and they still sent them over the top.

Character 1: [exhausted tone] Look at my hands, they won't stop shaking. [more firmly] Four years of blood under these fingernails that won't wash clean. [Gasping breath] How do we just go home and pour tea like nothing happened?

479 Character 2: [hollowly] Home. [nervous laugh] I don't even remember what my mother's kitchen smells like anymore. [growing desperate] All I know is carbolic acid, gangrene, and that sweet smell when the gas victims come in.

Character 1: [sudden shout] Stop! [quieter, pleading] Please, I can't... [Deep breath] We saved some though, didn't we? Remember Lieutenant Morrison? He's walking now, going back to his farm in Yorkshire. That has to mean something.

480 Character 2: [gently] Yes, we did save some. [voice strengthening] Maybe a thousand men between us who'll see their families again. [Shuddering sigh] But Mary, I keep seeing the faces of all the others haunting these tent walls.

Character 1: [in frustration] The bells are ringing in the village. [more softly] Can you hear them celebrating? [bitterly] Dancing in the streets while we're still here, surrounded by boys who'll never dance again. It feels so wrong.

481 Character 2: [firmly] They deserve to celebrate—God knows they've sacrificed enough. [voice dropping] But you're right, it feels strange. [Soft sob] My brother won't be coming back to join them. Passchendaele took him last year, remember?

Character 1: [sympathetically] Oh Catherine, I'm so sorry. [steadier] I forgot about James for a moment. [in pain] This joy everyone else feels, it's like acid on an open wound when you've lost everything, isn't it?

482 Character 2: [laughing through tears] Acid, yes—that's exactly it. [more controlled] The newspapers will call us heroes, angels of mercy. [Bitter chuckle] But angels shouldn't know how to tourniquets so fast, or recognize death's approach by smell alone.

Character 1: [resigned whisper] We're not angels, just women who've seen too much. [growing stronger] Tomorrow they'll ship us home with medals probably. [Hollow laugh] As if a piece of metal could somehow make sense of all this madness.

483 Character 2: [thoughtfully] Perhaps we're not meant to make sense of it. [voice breaking] Maybe we just carry it with us forever, like shrapnel too deep to remove. [more steadily] At least we'll carry it together—promise me that?

Character 1: [warmly] Together, always. [Sniffling breath] We've held each other through the worst humanity can offer. [stronger] No armistice changes that bond. When the nightmares come, and they will, you can call me anytime.

484 Character 2: [gratefully] The nightmares—God, they'll be awful won't they? [rapidly] Every time I close my eyes I see that boy from Birmingham. [Whimper] Eighteen years old, crying for his mother while his intestines spilled through my fingers.

Character 1: [urgently] Catherine, look at me. [soothing tone] We did everything we could with what we had. [firmly] Those boys knew we fought for them harder than any general ever did. That's our truth to hold.

485 Character 2: [quietly] You're right, I know you're right. [growing emotional] But Mary, what if I forget their faces? [Panicked breath] What if time makes them fade and all this suffering becomes meaningless, just another chapter in history books?

Character 1: [fiercely] Then we don't let them fade. [softer] We tell their stories, we name their names. [with conviction] We make sure the world knows that peace came at the cost of beautiful young souls who deserved better.

486 Character 2: [peacefully] Yes. [Deep exhale] We'll be their living memorial, won't we? [with determination] Every breath we take from now on is one they should have had. [trembling] So we'd better make them count, hadn't we, Mary?

Script: 1b05d9e8 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my daughter Emma's tutoring sessions—account number 4K7892B. [sighs heavily] We've had twelve sessions now, twelve! [more angrily] And her grades haven't budged an inch from that 68% average.

487 Customer Support: I understand your concern, let me pull up Emma's file right away. Account 4K7892B, yes, I see she's been working with Mr. Davidson. Can you tell me which specific areas you feel aren't improving?

Character 1: [exasperated] Math, obviously—we're paying $85 per session for calculus help! [groans] Her last three test scores were 64%, 69%, and—wait for it—[sarcastically] a whopping 65%. That's actually going backwards!

488 Customer Support: [concerned] Those scores are certainly not what we'd expect to see. I'm looking at Mr. Davidson's progress reports here, and he notes that Emma has been, um... arriving late to about half the sessions?

Character 1: [defensive] She's been late maybe twice, three times max! [more loudly] And even if that were true, which it's not, [accusingly] shouldn't your tutors be good enough to make progress regardless?

489 Customer Support: Of course, punctuality is just one factor we consider. Let me check something else—I see the sessions are scheduled for 4:30 PM at 1845 Maple Street. Has Emma been completing the assigned homework between sessions?

Character 1: [reluctantly] Well, she... she tries to do most of it. [sighs] Look, I'm not calling to make excuses—[firmly] I need to know what your guarantee actually means, because this isn't working.

490 Customer Support: Our satisfaction guarantee does cover situations like this, absolutely. I can offer you three options: switch to a different tutor, maybe Ms. Chen who has a 94% success rate, or we could try a different approach with two sessions weekly?

Character 1: [skeptically] Two sessions a week at $85 each? [laughs bitterly] That's $170 weekly—are you going to guarantee results then? [demanding] Because I've already spent over a thousand dollars here!

491 Customer Support: I completely understand the investment you've made. Actually, if we move to twice weekly, I can apply discount code EDU2024X for 20% off. Ms. Chen also offers a free assessment session to identify exactly where the gaps are.

Character 1: [considering] Ms. Chen, you said 94% success rate? [cautiously] What does that even mean—94% of what? [sighs] I just... I don't want to throw more money at this if it's not going to help Emma.

492 Customer Support: [confidently] That means 94% of her students improve by at least one letter grade within eight sessions. [enthusiastically] She specializes in calculus actually, and—between you and me, she's much better than Mr. Davidson with struggling students.

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, you're actually admitting Davidson isn't good? [chuckles dryly] That's refreshing honesty, I suppose. [seriously] Fine, let's try this Ms. Chen, but I want that assessment session documented—case number and everything.

493 Customer Support: [efficiently] Absolutely, I'm creating case number TUT-20241108-3921 right now. Ms. Chen has availability Tuesday and Thursday at 5:00 PM, same location. Should I schedule Emma's free assessment for this Tuesday, November 12th?

Character 1: [resigned] Yeah, fine, Tuesday works. [more firmly] But I'm documenting everything from now on—every session, every minute late, every homework assignment. [warningly] This is your last chance before I leave a review on every platform I can find.

494 Customer Support: That's completely fair, and we encourage parent involvement actually. I'm sending confirmation to your email at mrodriguez74@gmail. I'll also include Ms. Chen's direct extension, 4412, so you can communicate any concerns immediately.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Okay, mrodriguez74, that's correct. [sighs] Look, I don't mean to be difficult, but—[emotionally] this is my kid's future we're talking about, and these grades affect her college applications.

495 Customer Support: [empathetically] You're not being difficult at all—you're being a concerned parent. I have teenagers myself, I completely understand. [confidently] Let's give Ms. Chen these eight sessions, and if there's no improvement, we'll provide a full refund for those sessions.

Character 1: [surprised] A full refund? [cautiously optimistic] That's... actually fair. [more relaxed] Alright, Tuesday at 5:00 PM, 1845 Maple Street, with Ms. Chen. [firmly] But I'm holding you to that eight-session promise.

496 Customer Support: Perfect, it's all documented in case TUT-20241108-3921. [professionally] You'll receive the confirmation email within five minutes, and Ms. Chen will call you personally before Tuesday. [warmly] Thank you for giving us another chance—Emma's success is our priority too.

497 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is Sarah from Henderson Accounting. I see you've contacted us about missing documents for your tax filing. Let me pull up your account right away to help you.

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, I've been waiting for three weeks now! [sighs heavily] The deadline is in four days and I—I still haven't received the W-2 forms you promised. [anxiously] What's going on over there?

498 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [quickly] Looking at your file now... okay, I see here that we sent them on the 15th. [confused] Did you check your email spam folder by any chance?

Character 1: [exasperated] Of course I checked spam! [more loudly] I've checked everything—inbox, spam, trash, even my wife's email thinking maybe I gave you the wrong address. [groans] Nothing, absolutely nothing from you guys.

499 Customer Support: Alright, let me verify the email we have on file. Is it mchen at globaltech dot com? Wait, actually I'm seeing here... oh, there might be an issue with our server that day.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, a server issue. [more seriously] Look, I don't care about your technical problems—I need those documents TODAY. [pleading] Can't you just resend them now while we're on the phone?

500 Customer Support: [reassuringly] Absolutely, I can do that right now. I'm... I'm actually going to send them two ways—email and our secure portal. You'll have them within five minutes, I guarantee it.

Character 1: [skeptically] Five minutes? [chuckles bitterly] That's what your colleague said last Monday, and here we are. [tiredly] Do I need to drive down there and pick them up myself or something?

501 Customer Support: No, no, that won't be necessary at all. I'm personally handling this—sending now... and... done! Check your email right now, and I'll stay on the line to confirm you receive it.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh! [more cheerfully] Wait, I actually... yes, I see it coming through! [relieved sigh] Finally! Thank you, Sarah, you've saved my sanity here.

502 [Angry] You know what, I'm just—I'm done explaining myself to people who've already decided what I'm capable of. [Groan]

503 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just, um, pretend to be shocked when I actually pull this off, right? [Tsk]

504 [Happy] Wait till they see what I've been working on—honestly, their faces are gonna be priceless! [Laugh]

505 [Disappointed] I thought you'd at least, like, give me a chance before writing me off completely. [Sigh]

506 [Fast] Okay so basically everyone thinks I can't do it but they don't know I've already—never mind, they'll see. [Chuckle]

507 [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda like when they underestimate me—makes winning so much sweeter, y'know?

508 [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, um, if I'm really as capable as I think or if they're right. [Slow] [Sigh]

509 [Shout] I got the promotion! [Happy] All those people who said I wasn't ready can just—yeah! [Laugh]

510 [Angry] [Fast] No no no, you don't get to act surprised now when I told you I could handle this months ago!

511 [Sarcastic] I mean, why would anyone think the youngest person here might actually have, oh I dunno, fresh ideas? [Tsk] [Disappointed]

512 [Slow] The thing is—look, I've been doing this quietly, successfully, for like three years now without anyone noticing.

513 [Happy] You should've seen his face when I started speaking fluent Mandarin—he literally thought I was just the intern! [Laugh] [Fast]

514 [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna quit and go somewhere that'll, you know, actually see what I bring to the table.

515 [Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I thought that after everything I've accomplished, they'd finally start to, um, take me seriously.

516 [Angry] [Shout] Five patents! I have five patents and they still treat me like I'm some kind of—ugh!

517 [Chuckle] Funny how they're all scrambling to work with me now that I've, uh, basically saved the company. [Sarcastic]

518 [Fast] [Happy] Did you hear what Jennifer said about my presentation—wait, she actually called it brilliant, can you believe that?

519 [Sad] My own family doesn't even think I can—I mean, they literally laughed when I told them my plans. [Groan]

520 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's all pretend that the "surprising success" wasn't something I'd been telling everyone would happen for months.

521 [Whisper] Honestly? Part of me wants to fail just to, like, prove them right so they'll leave me alone. [Sigh] [Disappointed]

522 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly talking about a drain running slow, then looking at it, then seeing the hair buildup and gagging, ending in drain disgust

==================================================

[matter-of-fact]

So I was, um, I was doing dishes this morning and the, uh, the kitchen sink was draining really slow. Like, you know, just, um, just sitting there with all the soapy water not going anywhere. I figured it was, uh, probably just some food bits or whatever.

[casual]

So I'm like, okay, I should probably, um, I should probably take a look at this thing. I mean, it's been getting worse for, like, a few days now, so, um, so I figured I'd just— I'd just check it out real quick.

[slightly concerned]

I pull out my phone flashlight and I'm, uh, I'm looking down into the drain, and at first it just looks like, um, like normal drain stuff, you know? But then I— then I see this, uh, this dark clump just sitting there.

[realization dawning]

And I'm like, wait, what is— what is that exactly? So I lean in closer and— [sharp exhale] oh my god. Oh no. It's hair. It's like, um, it's like a whole— a whole nest of hair just, uh, just clogged up in there.

[disgusted]

And it's not just, um, it's not just a few strands, it's like— [gag] ugh, it's like a whole, uh, a whole hairball situation. Like, matted and gross and probably been there for— [shudder] I can't even think about it.

[building revulsion]

The smell hit me and I just— [gag] I literally had to, um, had to back away from the sink. It's so— it's so disgusting I can't even— how did I let it get that bad?

[peak disgust]

I'm never— I'm never looking in a drain again without, um, without expecting the worst. [dry heave] God, I can still smell it. It's like, uh, it's like wet dog mixed with— [gag] no, I can't. I literally cannot deal with this right now.
