Wait wait wait—what thing? Are you—oh my god, the dance competition? You actually went through with it?
Shut up. Shut UP. You're telling me you just—you won? Like, the whole thing? I mean, I knew you were practicing but I didn't even know you were gonna [Gasp] actually compete!
Okay no no no, we're not doing this. You literally won a dance competition and you're acting like you just, what, found five bucks on the sidewalk? This is huge!
Only twelve—are you kidding me right now? That's still twelve people who didn't win, y'know? Like, you beat actual dancers. With your body. Moving to music. [Laugh] Sorry, I'm just—I'm processing.
Of course she did! Oh my god, wait—did she film it? Please tell me someone filmed it because I'm gonna need to see this immediately. Like, right now.
Um, excuse me? Not great? You won! That's literally the definition of great! What style was it—wait, let me guess. Contemporary? No no, hip-hop?
Ballroom? You—okay that's even more insane because that requires like, actual technique and—hold on, did you have a partner? Who was your partner?
Stop it. [Chuckle] You're telling me you and a sixty-three-year-old named Sandra just absolutely destroyed the competition? That's—that's literally the best thing I've ever heard.
Okay but like, together you were obviously amazing, right? I mean, you don't just accidentally win these things. How long have you guys been practicing?
Three months of Tuesdays and you're out here winning trophies! Wait—there was a trophy, right? Please tell me there's like, a big sparkly trophy sitting in your apartment right now.
Oh god, oh no—I didn't mean to make her cry! I was just—I was having such a bad day and she kept asking about my job situation and I kinda... snapped.
I know, I know how that sounds. It's just—she wouldn't stop with the questions, y'know? Like "when are you gonna get promoted" and "why don't you apply somewhere else" and I—[groan] I'm not making this better, am I?
Right. Of course. I just—I told her it was none of her business, which was... that was completely out of line. Like, she was just being nice, trying to help, and I basically bit her head off.
I know that! I do, I swear I know that. Your mom's literally—she's like a second mom to me, which makes this so much worse. Wait wait, let me—I already called her to apologize but she didn't pick up. [nervous laugh] Probably screening my calls now, huh?
No. No, absolutely not. I was—god, I was such a jerk. The thing is, I've been so stressed about money and my parents keep comparing me to my sister and I just... I took it out on the wrong person. That's not an excuse though, I'm not—I'm not trying to make excuses.
What? No no no, that's—I could never hate her! She makes the best lasagna and always remembers my birthday and she—oh my god, is that really what she thinks? [quieter] I'm such an idiot.
I gotta fix this. I mean, I don't even know how to fix this but I have to try, right? Maybe I could—should I send flowers? Or like, write a letter? I'm honestly terrible at apologies but I can't—I can't have your mom thinking I hate her.
You're right, you're absolutely right. I'll—I'll go to your house tomorrow, if that's okay? Like, apologize face to face, properly. Tell her how much she means to me and that I was just being a complete ass because of my own stuff.
Tomorrow at 2, got it. And I'll—I'll bring those cookies she likes from the bakery downtown? Not as like, a bribe or anything, just... y'know. [sigh] I really am sorry. To you too, for putting you in this position.
I won't. I promise I won't. And um, thanks for—thanks for telling me how badly I messed up. I needed to hear it. Even though you're still kinda terrifying when you're mad, just so you know.
Oh god, okay—what's wrong? Did I do something? I mean, obviously I did something or you wouldn't be looking at me like that, but—
Did what? I don't—wait, oh no. Oh no no no. The interrupting thing? Is this about the interrupting? Because Julie mentioned something last week and I thought she was joking but—
I know, I know! I'm sorry, I just—my brain goes so fast and I get excited and the words just kinda... fall out? [nervous laugh] That's not an excuse though, I know it's not.
That's—okay that's fair. That's totally fair. I've been trying to work on it, I swear, but it's like—honestly? Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it until after. Which sounds fake but it's not, I promise.
No! No, that's not—I care so much about what you say! I literally—that's why I get so excited and wanna respond right away because I'm interested! But I see how that's... yeah, that's actually terrible. [groan] God, I'm the worst.
Wait, what? You've been—oh. Oh that's... that really hurts to hear but I—I get it. I totally get why you'd just give up trying. Um, how long has this been bothering you?
Months?! And you didn't—actually no, you probably tried to tell me and I interrupted that too, didn't I? Jesus. I'm so, so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry.
I want that too! I really—I wanna be better about this. Maybe you could like, I dunno, give me a signal when I do it? Or just straight up tell me to shut up? [sigh] I need to actually listen instead of just... waiting for my turn to talk.
Yes! Please! Call me out every single time, I mean it. I'd rather you do that than—than lose you as a friend because I can't keep my mouth shut, y'know?
I will, I promise I will. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna practice with other people too, like really focus on it. Thank you for telling me instead of just... giving up on me completely. That means a lot.
I haven't been—okay no, that's not fair. I have been. But it's not what you think, I swear. There's just been so much going on and I didn't know how to—how to talk about it.
No no no, I didn't disappear! I mean, I guess I kinda did but—[nervous laugh] god, I'm really bad at this. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but every time I tried to bring it up I just... froze.
It's—okay, this is gonna sound so stupid. But um, remember when we were supposed to hang out like a month ago? And I canceled last minute? That's when everything started getting weird and I just—I didn't know how to explain without sounding like a complete mess.
I know! I know I could have and I should have and honestly I'm—I'm the worst friend. Like literally the worst. You deserved better than me just pulling away without any explanation.
My therapist said I was doing this thing where I—wait, that's not how I wanted to start. [Sigh] Basically I've been dealing with some anxiety stuff and instead of talking about it like a normal person, I just... avoided everyone who matters to me.
Yeah, I um—I started seeing someone. About a month ago actually. That's what I was gonna tell you but then I got all weird about it because I didn't want you to think I was like, broken or something? Which is so dumb, I know I know.
Not just—well, kinda? It's more like... I was embarrassed? And then the longer I waited to tell you, the weirder it got, and then I was anxious about being anxious which is just—[groan] it's so ridiculous when I say it out loud.
No! Well, maybe? I dunno, I wasn't thinking straight. I was just so caught up in my own head and I—I convinced myself that everyone would see me differently. Which isn't fair to you at all, I know that now.
Wait, what? You have? I had no—why didn't you ever say anything?
You're right. You're totally right and I just—I made this huge thing out of nothing and hurt you in the process. I'm really, really sorry. Can we just—can we please go back to normal? I miss you so much it literally hurts.
noticing their phone is at 5% battery with no charger nearby
[breathless] Oh my god, is that really you? [getting louder] I can't believe it's been three months! [nervous laugh] You look exactly the same, maybe even better—have you been working out or something?
[pleading tone] Just five minutes, please? [faster] I've been meaning to text you but didn't know what to say. [soft whimper] I still have your sweater at my place—the blue one you loved.
[trembling] Are you seeing someone? [accusatory] Is that why you're being so cold? [bitter laugh] I saw you tagged at that new restaurant last week—the one we always planned to try together.
[defensive shout] That was a mistake! [quieter now] I was confused and scared of how serious things were getting. [sniffling] Can't we just grab coffee sometime and talk like adults about everything?
[desperately] But what about our trip to Seattle? [rambling faster] The non-refundable tickets, the hotel reservations? [choking up] I know it's next month, but maybe we could still go as friends?
[wounded] You act like I'm some kind of monster. [more pitifully] All I did was love you too much. [whispered] Sometimes I drive by your apartment just to feel close to you again.
[frantic] Your friends still like me! [defensive tone] Rachel invited me to her party last week—I'm not some pariah. [softer] Maybe if you'd actually talk to me, I wouldn't have to reach out.
[crying now] I just miss what we had. [barely audible] Every morning I wake up expecting your texts. [desperate whisper] Don't you ever think about the good times—our Sunday brunches, movie marathons?
[angry outburst] How can you be so heartless? [accusingly] Two years together and you act like I'm nothing! [bitter] Did I really mean that little to you all along?
[defensive shout] It was one kiss! [quieter, ashamed] One stupid, drunken mistake at a party. [pleading again] People work through worse things—my parents did, yours did too, remember?
[defensive] Mr. Harrison, I prepared your return based on the documents you provided. [more firmly] You gave me receipts totaling $23,450 in business expenses, remember? [sighs] I can't verify what you don't show me.
[apologetically] The address error was... unfortunate, yes. [more calmly] But you wrote down 4521 Oak Avenue on your intake form, not Street. [pause] And the EIN issue—that came from your QuickBooks file you uploaded on March 15th.
[firmly] I said estimates were acceptable for small amounts, not... not for half your deductions! [exasperated] The IRS Form 4549 they sent shows you claimed 42,000 business miles. [slower] Where's your documentation for that?
[defensive tone] Mr. Harrison, being your preparer doesn't mean I can fabricate documentation. [more steadily] The audit notice CP2000 specifically questions three deposits of $15,000, $22,000, and $8,500. [carefully] You told me those were loans, but where's the paperwork?
[sympathetically] I understand you're stressed, but... listen, we need actual loan agreements. [more gently] The revenue agent, Ms. Chen, badge number RA-5569, she's requesting specific documentation. [reassuring] We can still fix this if you cooperate.
[briskly] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your account ending in 4782. [more quickly] You're currently at your credit limit of—let me see—eight thousand dollars. How can I help you today?
[surprised] Oh, you want to decrease your limit? [more gently] That's actually quite responsible of you. [quickly] Most people call asking for increases, so this is refreshing to hear, honestly.
[professionally] I completely understand your situation. [speaking rapidly] Let me pull up the options—we can reduce it to six thousand, four thousand, or even lower if you'd prefer. [reassuring] The change would be immediate.
[typing quickly] Three thousand it is—just need to confirm a few details first. [brisk tone] This is permanent until you request another change, and [pause] [carefully] any pending charges over the new limit will be declined.
[efficiently] Processing now... and done! [cheerfully] Your new limit is three thousand dollars effective immediately. [more seriously] You'll still owe the current balance of eight thousand, of course, but no new charges above three thousand.
[encouragingly] Exactly, and if you maintain your current payment schedule—let me check—[quickly] two hundred fifty monthly, you'll have significant progress within eighteen months. [helpfully] Would you like to discuss payment plan options?
[warmly] There's absolutely nothing to judge—you're taking control of your finances. [speaking faster] That takes real courage, and honestly, I wish more customers would make this choice. [professionally] Is there anything else?
[quickly] Absolutely, yes! [clearly] As long as you're below three thousand, the card functions normally. [reassuring] You're not closing the account, just setting a boundary for yourself.
[chuckles softly] Financial boundaries are actually a great place to begin! [briskly] I've noted everything in your account. [kindly] You should receive an email confirmation within the hour.
[supportively] Exactly, one step at a time. [more firmly] Focus on that eight thousand first. [warmly] We're here if you need anything else—payment arrangements, budget tools, whatever helps.
[Slow] Oh wow, Aunt Carol, that's, um, that's quite a story about your neighbor's cat. [Chuckle] [Fast] Hey, I actually gotta run to the store before it closes!
[Sigh] You know what, I'd love to hear the rest but my phone's about to—it's literally at like two percent right now.
[Happy] Wait, someone's at the door! [Shout] Coming! [Normal] Sorry, Uncle Ted, I really should get that.
[Disappointed] I hate to cut you off but, uh, the dog just threw up on the—oh god, it's everywhere. [Groan]
[Sarcastic] No, no, please tell me more about your coworker's daughter's wedding plans. [Tsk] Actually, sorry, I'm being called into another room.
[Fast] The timer just went off for my—I mean, I've got something in the oven that's gonna burn if I don't... [Laugh]
[Whisper] Mom's calling me on the other line and you know how she gets when I don't pick up. [Sigh] I should probably take this.
Well, this has been really—I mean, honestly, it's been great catching up, but work starts super early tomorrow, so...
[Sad] I'm getting such a bad headache, Grandma. [Slow] Maybe we could, um, maybe continue this another time?
[Angry] What? No, not you—sorry, the kids are just—[Shout] Put that down! [Fast] I really need to deal with this situation.
[Chuckle] You're gonna think I'm crazy but I actually forgot I have a, uh, a thing—an appointment thing in like ten minutes.
[Happy] Oh my goodness, yes, we should definitely do lunch soon! [Fast] But right now I'm kinda running late for—yeah, gotta go!
[Disappointed] The connection's getting really bad, I can barely—what? [Tsk] I think we're breaking up here.
[Slow] So basically what you're saying is—actually, hold that thought, someone's beeping in and it might be important. [Sigh]
[Sarcastic] Fascinating stuff about your grocery store experience, really. [Chuckle] But my boss just walked in, so...
I dunno, Uncle Ray, my ear's getting kinda sore from holding the phone this long, y'know?
[Whisper] The baby finally just fell asleep and I should probably—I mean, I need to ninja my way out of this room. [Slow] Really quietly.
[Happy] That reminds me! [Fast] I completely forgot I promised to call Jennifer back about—oh geez, she's gonna kill me if I don't call her now.
[Groan] Ugh, sorry, I just remembered I left the garage door open and it's supposed to rain. [Fast] Let me just—I'll call you back later?
[Sad] Listen, Dad, this has been nice but I'm just emotionally drained from today and I think I need to just... [Sigh] [Slow] decompress a little.
Complaining about a rude driver, then admits they didn't signal either
I—okay, yes, I knew something was coming, but it wasn't like I had details or—I mean, I couldn't just tell you based on rumors, y'know?
That's not—[sigh] okay okay, I heard whispers three weeks ago, but nothing concrete until like, last Tuesday. And even then, I wasn't supposed to know. My manager literally made me promise not to say anything.
And my job is how I pay rent! Come on, you're acting like I—like I wanted this to happen. I've been losing sleep over this, trying to figure out if I should tell you or not.
That's really unfair. I tried to—look, I kept dropping hints, remember? I told you to update your resume, I said the company was being weird lately. [frustrated laugh] What did you think I meant?
Well I couldn't exactly spell it out! I'm sorry you're—no, actually, y'know what? I'm kinda frustrated too. You're making me the bad guy when management's the one who screwed you over.
Pretend? Are you—wow. Okay. That's what you think this is? Ten years of friendship and I'm suddenly pretending because I was in an impossible situation?
And lose my job too? Then we'd both be screwed. I mean—I get that you're hurt, I really do, but honestly? You're not even trying to—[groan] whatever. Fine. I should've risked everything to tell you something I barely knew myself.
That's easy to say when you're not the one who'd be violating an NDA. Look look, I'm sorry you found out this way, I am, but I was literally trying to protect both of us here.
By not making things worse! If I'd told you and you'd confronted them or—or started acting different, they would've known. We both would've been out immediately. Is that what you wanted?
And I wanted to give you one without destroying my entire career. [quieter] I'm sorry I couldn't figure out how to do both. But I'm not gonna pretend I don't feel kinda betrayed too that you think I'd ever intentionally hurt you like this.
What? I'm not—I don't rewrite anything! I just remember things differently sometimes, that's all. Everyone does that, right? Memory isn't like, perfect or anything.
Wait wait wait, hold on—I didn't say drunk, I said you were tipsy! There's a difference and I—okay that's not the point. [nervous laugh] I shouldn't have said anything at all, I know.
Right, yeah, no no no, you're right. I think I got confused with another party maybe? Or I just—I dunno, sometimes stories get mixed up in my head and I don't mean to—
That's not—okay, I can see why you'd think that. But I swear I'm not doing it on purpose! My brain just kinda... fills in gaps sometimes? And then I believe my own version and—god, that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.
Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm—I'm so sorry. I never wanted to make you feel like that, I swear. That's like, literally the worst thing and I—[groan] I really messed up, didn't I?
Okay those—those were all misunderstandings! Except maybe the birthday thing, I definitely got that wrong. But I honestly thought I was remembering correctly! I wasn't trying to gaslight you or whatever, I just—my memory sucks sometimes.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I do that. I get all defensive and then I double down even when I'm probably—definitely wrong. It's this stupid thing where I can't admit I might be misremembering because then I feel like an idiot.
Fuck. When you put it like that—I mean, that's exactly what I've been doing, isn't it? [quieter] God, I'm such an asshole. No wonder you're mad at me.
I will. I promise I will. From now on if I'm not sure about something, I'll just—I'll say that, y'know? Like "hey, I might be wrong but" instead of acting like I have perfect recall. Because clearly I don't.
Really? You're—you're giving me another chance? Thank you, seriously. And next time just call me out immediately, okay? Like don't let me spiral into my weird false memory thing. Just be like "nope, that's not what happened" and I'll shut up.
Wait wait wait—you hit it? Like, the whole thing? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! How long has it been, like six months? Eight?
Fourteen—okay wow, that's some serious dedication right there. I mean, I can't even save for like, a weekend trip without accidentally [Laugh] buying something stupid online, y'know?
No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you minimize it! This is huge! Like, literally huge. What was it for again, the house thing or—?
Six months? That's so—honestly that's so smart. Most people don't even have like, six days saved, right? You must feel so... I dunno, secure? Free?
Weird how? Like good weird or—wait, are you okay? You don't seem as excited as I thought you'd—I mean, I'd be like, popping champagne or something [Chuckle].
Oh. Oh, I totally get that. It's like when you finish a really long show and you're just kinda... lost? But hey, this is—this is the fun part now, right?
Yeah! Like, you can actually think about other goals without that hanging over you. Maybe something actually fun this time? Travel or—ooh, or that photography thing you mentioned?
Okay but—but you were so into it! And now you've got this cushion, so if you wanted to like, take a class or buy decent equipment, you totally could without the guilt.
Well, start thinking! This is—god, I'm so proud of you, seriously. Most people just talk about doing this stuff but you actually [Sigh] did it, y'know?
Um, we're definitely celebrating though. Like, I don't care if you think it's not a big deal—we're getting dinner. The good place, not the sketchy taco truck. Although... actually the taco truck sounds pretty good too.
Wait, what? No, that's—I thought you knew! Marcus said he was gonna tell you like, weeks ago. I literally assumed you just couldn't make it or something.
Okay but—how is that my fault? I'm not the one organizing it. Jake's been handling all the—the group chat stuff, and I just figured... [sigh] I mean, you're always in the loop about everything.
Come on, that's not—you're acting like I deliberately excluded you. I didn't even make the group chat! I got added to it like, three days after it started.
I—okay, yeah, maybe I could've, but honestly? You've been so busy lately, barely responding to texts, and I just... I dunno, I thought maybe you were taking a break from group stuff. [frustrated laugh] Which apparently was the wrong assumption.
No! That's not—god, you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're making it sound like there was this big conspiracy to leave you out, and that's literally not what happened.
And they all probably thought the same thing I did! We—I mean, you know how these things go, everyone assumes someone else handled it. It's not great, I know that, but it's not personal.
Well it wasn't meant to be! Jesus, I—[scoff] I'm sorry you got left out, okay? I am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you think I'd do that to you on purpose. Like, really? After everything?
I didn't—we barely hung out those three weeks! You cancelled on coffee twice, and when we did text it was about your work drama. When was I supposed to casually bring up a trip I thought you already knew about?
Okay okay, fine. You're right. I should've—I should've brought it up. But you gotta understand, I wasn't trying to hide it from you. That's... that's what's killing me here. You think I was being shady and I just... wasn't.
Yeah. We were. And I—look, I fucked up by assuming, alright? But you're not exactly blameless here either. You've been MIA for weeks, and now you wanna act like we're terrible friends for not chasing you down? That's not... [trails off] Whatever. I don't know what you want me to say.
Wait wait wait—THE internship? The one you were like, totally convinced you wouldn't get? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
I'm—okay I'm literally about to scream. This is huge! Like, this is the one at the place with the—with all the fancy people, right? [Gasp] When do you start?
Three—okay that's soon. That's really soon. But like, they're helping with that stuff, right? Housing and everything? Because honestly, that's kinda fast to just pack up and—
Of course they do, because you're—I mean, they'd be stupid not to. God, I'm so proud of you. Like, genuinely. You worked your ass off for this.
No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay it. This is literally, what, like a thousand people applied? And they picked YOU. [Laugh] That's not "just" anything.
Twelve hun—see? SEE? That's even more insane! Are you, like... are you excited? You seem kinda... I dunno, quiet about it.
Yeah, no, totally—that makes sense. It's like, even good stuff can be overwhelming, y'know? The whole moving thing and starting somewhere new and... yeah.
Oh, babe. Okay, um—can I be real with you for a sec? They don't just randomly pick people. Like, they saw something in you that—[Sigh] that maybe you don't see yet.
And? So what? You're gonna—you're gonna show up and be yourself and that's literally why they wanted you. Not some, like, cookie-cutter Ivy League robot, y'know?
I'm always right about this stuff. Honestly though? You're gonna kill it. And I'm gonna need, like, weekly updates because I'll be living vicariously through you.
realizing they forgot their reusable cup for the coffee shop
[nervously] Hi Marcus, thanks for meeting with me. [clearing throat] I know this transition has been... complicated. [quieter] I really value your experience here, and I'd love to discuss how we can work together moving forward.
[defensive] Look, I didn't ask for this promotion over you. [softer] But I'm here now, and we need to make this work. [steadier voice] Can we at least try to find some common ground professionally?
[frustrated sigh] This isn't about degrees, Marcus! [pleading] I need your help—I'm drowning here. [whispered admission] I don't even understand half the technical stuff you built, and everyone expects me to just know it all.
[exhausted laugh] I'm too tired to pretend anymore. [desperately] Yesterday I accidentally deleted a client database thinking it was a test file. [panicked whisper] IT recovered it, but I nearly had a heart attack waiting.
[relieved giggle] Jerry turned three different shades of purple. [more seriously] But Marcus, this is exactly why I need you. [genuine tone] Would you consider being technical lead? Same team, but you'd own all system architecture decisions.
[eagerly] Yes, exactly that! [laughing] God, I hate those quarterly reviews too. [confidentially] Last week Henderson talked for forty minutes about synergy. [groaning] I wanted to throw myself out the conference room window.
[firmly] Completely serious. [hopeful] You know the systems, I'll handle the politics. [quieter and sincere] Plus, between us, your salary adjustment would reflect the expanded role—I already got it pre-approved before asking you here.
[excited] Monday, if you're on board! [quickly] I've already drafted the org chart changes. [nervous again] Though I should warn you, Peterson from accounting is furious about the budget increase—he might corner you.
[relief washing over] Thank God, I thought you'd say no. [firmly] Zero micromanaging, I promise. [lighter] Honestly, I'll be too busy trying to understand what you're doing to interfere anyway. [pause] That's a joke. Mostly.
[vulnerably] Thank you for saying that, Marcus. [steadying breath] I know I have a lot to learn from you. [determined] But I promise I'll also have your back with upper management—that's something I actually am good at.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [calmly] Let me pull up your account using that warranty number—DW-78342-K, correct? [concerned] I see here we've serviced your unit on July 15th and September 2nd.
[reassuringly] Sir, I'm going to personally escalate this to our senior technician team. [professional tone] We have an opening tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM or—wait, actually—[more optimistically] I can squeeze you in today at 4:15 PM.
[sympathetically] I wish I could send someone immediately, Mr. Chen. [more firmly] But our technician, Marcus, badge number T-4421, can definitely fix this before your party. [encouraging] He's our most experienced specialist with a 98% first-visit resolution rate.
[professionally] Given your situation, I'm authorizing a full unit replacement if today's repair doesn't hold. [more confidently] I'm adding override code RX-9000-PRIORITY to your file right now. [sincerely] This shouldn't have happened three times, and we're going to make it right.
[assuringly] Marcus will receive your service ticket immediately with high priority status. [earnestly] I'm also crediting your account $200 for the inconvenience—confirmation code CR-7734-M. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Chen?
[attentively] I'm noting that specifically—DLX-500, error code E4 on the digital display. [helpfully] Marcus will bring replacement parts for the control board and heating element, which are the usual culprits. [reassuring tone] We'll get this resolved today.
[confidently] Marcus has twelve years with our company and specializes in the DLX series. [understanding] I see tech B-3356's notes were... limited, which isn't acceptable. [more seriously] I'm documenting everything in your file for our quality assurance team to review.
[readily] Absolutely, you can reach me directly at extension 4-0-9-2, ask for Sarah, employee ID S-1147. [sincerely] I'll be here until 8 PM tonight, and I'll personally follow up tomorrow morning. [determined] We're going to solve this.
[assuringly] Marcus will be there at 4:15 sharp—I'm sending him your gate code 7-7-3-9 right now. [professionally] He'll call you at the number ending in 8845 when he's ten minutes away. [empathetically] Your dinner party won't be affected, I promise.
[earnestly] I completely agree, Mr. Chen, three breakdowns is unacceptable. [warmly] After Marcus completes the repair, I'll personally ensure your replacement unit is pre-authorized and ready if needed. [confidently] Thank you for your patience, and Marcus will see you at 4:15.
[professionally] Good afternoon, I see you're contacting us about a return issue. [quickly] Let me pull up your account here and—oh, I'm seeing two previous attempts. [sympathetically] Can you tell me what happened?
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, truly. [more quickly] Looking at the notes here... um, it seems there was a processing error on our end. [reassuringly] Let me escalate this right now to make sure it doesn't happen again.
[more firmly] You're absolutely right to be upset. [briskly] Here's what I'm doing differently—I'm personally flagging this for manual review and, uh, bypassing the automated system entirely. [determined] Would you prefer a full refund or store credit with an additional 20% bonus?
[confidently] Processing the refund right now as we speak. [quickly] You'll see it in 3-5 business days, and I'm—I'm also emailing you a prepaid return label that's priority tracked. [reassuring] This one goes directly to our special returns department.
[honestly] The previous labels went through standard returns, which... which apparently had a glitch with your order code. [more quickly] This one has a override code that I've personally attached. [firmly] It cannot be redirected back to you.
[warmly] Exactly, and I've added a note for free pickup service if you prefer. [briskly] The driver will come tomorrow between 2 and 4 PM, or—or you can drop it off yourself. [cheerfully] Whatever's easier for you after this hassle.
[enthusiastically] Absolutely! You'll get three confirmations actually—pickup, facility arrival, and refund processed. [quickly] I'm also sending you my direct extension in case, um, in case anything goes sideways. [confidently] But it won't.
[professionally] It will work, I guarantee it. [more personally] Between you and me, I've flagged this as a priority case because three attempts is—is completely unacceptable. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help with today?
[reassuringly] Oh, absolutely not! [quickly] I'm adding a detailed note explaining the situation, and actually—actually I'm adding a loyalty credit to your account for the inconvenience. [firmly] Your account standing is perfect.
[warmly] That's exactly what we want to hear. [briskly] You'll receive all the confirmation emails within the next five minutes, including my direct line. [cheerfully] Thank you for your patience through this whole ordeal.
[Angry] Look, I don't care what everyone thinks—pineapple on pizza is actually, like, the perfect combination of sweet and savory, okay? [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, because the majority is always right about everything. [Laugh] Remember when everyone thought the earth was flat?
[Fast] I've done the research, I've looked at the data, and honestly the numbers don't—they just don't lie about this stuff. [Defensive]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I think deep down, um, people actually agree but they're too scared to admit it. [Sigh]
[Happy] You know what? I'm glad I believe this! [Laugh] It makes me different and I kinda like standing out from the crowd.
[Slow] The thing is... nobody wants to hear it because it challenges what they've believed their whole lives, y'know? [Disappointed]
[Shout] Would you just let me finish my point before you—before you jump all over me about it? [Groan]
[Sad] I used to keep quiet about it, but I'm just, I'm tired of pretending I agree when I really, really don't. [Sigh]
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, another person telling me I'm wrong without actually listening to my reasoning—how original.
[Fast] [Happy] Actually wait, wait, wait—I found three studies that basically prove what I'm saying, so it's not just me being weird!
[Disappointed] I mean, I thought you of all people would at least, like, try to understand where I'm coming from. [Tsk]
[Angry] [Fast] This is exactly why I don't usually bring it up because everyone gets all—they get defensive and won't even consider it!
[Chuckle] Honestly? In ten years everyone's gonna pretend they believed this all along. [Sarcastic] Mark my words.
[Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm actually wrong, but then I remember... no, no, the evidence is there.
[Slow] You're allowed to disagree, but, um, dismissing it without even thinking about it? [Disappointed] [Sigh] That's just closed-minded.
[Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, finally someone who's willing to actually discuss it instead of just laughing at me!
[Groan] Here we go again—I mention it once and suddenly I'm the, the crazy person in the room. [Angry]
[Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, let's all just believe the same thing forever and never question anything—that sounds super healthy for society.
[Sad] [Slow] I dunno, maybe I'm just seeing something that... that other people can't see yet, or won't see.
[Shout] It's not stupid! [Angry] [Fast] Just because it's different doesn't mean—ugh, why do I even bother trying to explain anymore?
Casually talking about a backup they assumed existed, then checking, then finding years of work isn't actually backed up anywhere, spiraling into data loss terror
Got—wait, got what? Oh my god, oh my god, is this about the thing? The promotion thing? Because if it is, I'm literally gonna scream right now.
SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up—are you serious? [Gasp] This is the one you've been waiting for since, what, like 2019? Maybe longer?
Okay that's—that's actually insane. Six years. Six whole years of them just... dangling it, y'know? And now it's yours. How are you even feeling right now?
Tired? Oh babe, no no no, that's just—I mean, yeah, of course you're exhausted. You've been basically running on fumes waiting for this. But like... also proud? Happy? Anything?
A sad desk—[Laugh] okay that's weirdly perfect though? Like you've probably eaten a thousand sad desk salads waiting for this call, right? This is poetic justice or whatever.
Oh she's gonna—wait, she's gonna lose it. Hasn't she been asking about this literally every Sunday dinner? "Any news about the job, honey?" That whole thing?
Well now you can finally—actually, y'know what? Now you can be like "Yeah Mom, actually there IS news" and just... drop it on her. [Chuckle] She's gonna cry, isn't she?
Okay but this is different—this is her baby getting recognized for being, like, absolutely incredible at what they do. Because that's what this is, right? Validation. Finally.
Feel the—oh honey, no. That's not weird at all. It's like... you've been in limbo for so long that normal probably feels bizarre right now, y'know? When do you actually start?
Monday? That's—wait that's in like three days! Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating this weekend then. And I mean properly celebrating, not just... sitting there looking shell-shocked while I drink champagne at you.
Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? The big one? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
A full—okay, um, excuse me? [Gasp] That's literally life-changing! Why are you being so calm about this? I'd be like, screaming or crying or—honestly probably both.
No no no, that's—that's totally fair actually. It's huge, y'know? Like when something this good happens it's almost... surreal? Did they call you or—how'd you find out?
You almost—oh my god, imagine. That would've been... [Laugh] okay that's actually terrifying to think about. But like, you checked it! You got it! This is everything you worked for, right?
Babe, what? No—you're literally the smartest person I know. All those late nights, all that stress... I mean, they saw what everyone else sees, y'know?
Three thou—okay and they picked YOU. Out of three thousand! That's like—that's insane odds. Have you told your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it.
You wanted to—[Chuckle] stop, I'm gonna cry. That's so sweet. But also like, call them! Right now! They've been worried about tuition for months, haven't they?
She's gonna—oh god she's gonna sob. Happy tears this time though. This changes everything for you guys, doesn't it? Like, no more stress about loans or working three jobs or—
Okay but—but you'll still eat ramen with me sometimes, right? [Laugh] Like, for nostalgia? When you're all successful and scholarship-y?
Um, duh, because I actually add vegetables. But seriously though—I'm so, so proud of you. You deserve this more than anyone, and I just... yeah. You did it, babe.
discovering the show they wanted to watch was removed from streaming
[nervously] So I wrapped Mom's gift last night, the silk scarf from that boutique downtown. [speeding up] You know, the one with the peacock pattern she kept eyeing? [Soft giggle] Cost me half my paycheck but totally worth it.
[Shrieking laugh] No no no no NO! [breathlessly] This cannot be happening! We literally live in different cities and somehow bought the [voice cracking] SAME scarf? [Snort] Mom's going to think we coordinated this like five-year-olds!
[whimpering] The receipt's at home and the party's in two hours. [more frantically] Maybe we could say it's intentional? Like, [sarcastically sweet] "Oh Mom, we got you matching scarves so you'll never lose one!" [Groaning laugh]
[relieved shout] YES! Do that! [more calmly] Actually no, traffic's horrible right now with the parade. [defeated] You'd never make it back. [Bitter chuckle] We're stuck being the twins who can't gift separately.
[through tears] Stop making me laugh, my mascara's running! [Hiccupping giggle] Dad's going to roast us forever about this. [mimicking deep voice] "Six hundred dollars for one scarf, impressive economics girls!" [more hysterically] We're never hearing the end!
[giggling uncontrollably] You know what though? [more warmly] At least we both noticed what she wanted. [softly] That's pretty sweet actually. [Snorting] Even if we're complete disasters at coordinating surprise gifts between us.
[mock serious] Spreadsheet? We need a whole database at this point! [getting louder] Password protected, encrypted, with two-factor authentication! [Cackling] "Sarah's Gift Security System" has a nice ring to it, [teasingly] don't you think?
[gleefully] We could make it a competition! [faster] "Mom, judge which daughter wrapped theirs better!" [melodramatically] "Which peacock speaks to your soul more deeply?" [Shrieking giggle] Turn our disaster into performance art, why not?
[suddenly hopeful] Wait that's TRUE! [excitedly building] She literally wore three necklaces to brunch last week! [triumphant] We didn't buy duplicates, we bought her a matching SET! [Victorious cackle] We're geniuses! Accidental fashion-forward gift-giving geniuses!
[mischievously] Let's tie them together into one mega-scarf! [Wheezing] Six feet of peacock glory wrapped around her! [more seriously] But honestly? [sweetly] She'll probably cry happy tears anyway because we both thought of her.
[formally] Mrs. Henderson, our records indicate you've missed eleven consecutive payments totaling $18,947.33. [more sternly] The property at 1847 Maple Street is, um, significantly underwater, and [dismissively] we've already extended the grace period twice beyond standard protocol.
[coldly] The modification department reviewed your file, reference number MOD-7745-XJ2, on September 15th. [more firmly] Your debt-to-income ratio of 78% exceeds our threshold, and [matter-of-factly] frankly, Mrs. Henderson, we're a business, not a charity organization.
[patronizing] The original loan agreement, document LN-2014-8823-A, clearly states the consequences of default. [more curtly] Section 14, paragraph 3B specifically outlines [sighs] the acceleration clause that, well, you apparently didn't read before signing.
[unmoved] Four thousand five hundred against nearly nineteen thousand? [sarcastically] That's barely 23% of what you owe, and [more harshly] promises about Friday money don't, um, don't satisfy legal obligations or court orders.
[defensively] All correspondence was sent per regulation Z, compliance code CFR-1026.41. [more aggressively] Mrs. Henderson, you've had since notice date 08/22/2023 to respond, and [exasperated] verbal assurances don't override written contracts—that's just how it works.
[impatiently] Credit reporting is automated through TransUnion, reference TU-445-MMC. [more bluntly] Your score dropped because you stopped paying, not—not because we're vindictive, and [sighs heavily] market conditions have changed since your initial inquiry, obviously.
[condescendingly] Market valuations from, um, from eight months ago are irrelevant now. [more firmly] The current BPO report, file BPO-9834-Z, estimates $241,000, and [dismissively] that's assuming optimal conditions which, frankly, don't exist anymore.
[mechanically] Past payment history doesn't negate current contractual violations under UCC 9-607. [more coldly] The investors holding your note, portfolio PF-2014-Q4-8823, they require us to [sighs] to pursue all remedies outlined in the security instrument.
[defensively] Those programs expired in 2018 and 2016 respectively, ma'am. [more sternly] Your applications were submitted, well, two years too late, and [exasperated] current FHA guidelines under case FH-9923-C don't apply to conventional loans anyway.
[softening slightly] The eviction date is November 30th, per court order CV-2023-8847. [more quietly] You'll receive the cash-for-keys offer, document CFK-9902, for $3,000 if you, um, [sighs] if you vacate without damage by November 15th.
[cheerfully] Good afternoon, Bella's Bouquets and Events, this is Sandra speaking. [more quickly] How can I help make your special day perfect?
[calmly] Okay, let's take this one step at a time. [reassuringly] I have your file right here—the Morrison wedding, June fifteenth, correct? [briskly] Tell me about the backyard space we're working with.
[professionally] We can absolutely make adjustments. [more firmly] The round centerpieces won't work on rectangular tables, but—here's the good news—[optimistically] we can redesign them as gorgeous runners with the same flowers, actually saves you about three hundred dollars.
[quickly] Right, the white rose arch with peonies. [thoughtfully] For a backyard setting, I'd suggest repositioning it as your ceremony backdrop instead. [more enthusiastically] Actually, against natural greenery, it'll photograph even better than in that beige ballroom.
[chuckles softly] Rustic is only if you want it to be. [confidently] We'll add some elegant touches—crystal drops on the arch, maybe upgrade to gold-rimmed vases? [briskly] I can email you photos of our premium outdoor setups right now.
[reassuringly] We've done hundreds of summer outdoor events. [speaking quickly] We'll deliver everything later, keep them in coolers until setup, and I'll personally spray them with anti-wilt treatment. [more gently] Your flowers will look fresh all evening, I promise.
[briskly] LED candles, battery-operated, they even flicker realistically. [enthusiastically] No fire hazard, no melting wax, and honestly, they photograph identically to real ones. [quickly] I'll swap those out at no extra charge since it's our venue change policy.
[warmly] That's what we're here for. [efficiently] So let me recap the changes—twelve rectangular runners instead of twenty round centerpieces, arch relocated for ceremony backdrop, LED candles in the candelabras. [questioning] Anything else worrying you?
[chuckles] Those stay exactly the same, don't worry. [reassuringly] Personal flowers are completely independent of venue. [more briskly] I'll have the revised contract ready by tomorrow morning with the new total, which is actually four hundred less than your original.
[professionally] That's wonderful news for your budget! [warmly] Listen, I'll also include our emergency day-of contact number. [speaking quickly] If anything comes up, even the morning of, we have a rapid response team ready.
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, another story about your promotion—I mean, it's not like I've been trying to tell you about my dad's surgery for twenty minutes. [Tsk]
[Fast] You know what, I'm just gonna—actually, never mind, you're clearly not listening anyway. [Sigh]
[Disappointed] I literally just asked if you wanted to hear about my trip and you somehow made it about your ex-boyfriend again. [Slow]
[Whisper] Do you ever, um, do you ever wonder what's going on in other people's lives? [Sad] Like, at all?
[Happy] Wait wait wait—you actually just asked me a question about myself! [Laugh] This is like, historic!
[Angry] I'm sorry, but I gotta interrupt here because this is the fifth time today you've told me about your CrossFit routine. [Groan]
[Slow] So basically what you're saying is that, uh, everything I experience reminds you of something better that happened to you? [Sarcastic]
[Shout] Can we please—PLEASE—have one conversation that doesn't circle back to your dating life? [Tsk]
[Chuckle] You know, I was gonna tell you I got engaged, but sure, let's talk about your new haircut for another hour. [Sarcastic]
[Fast] Okay so like, remember when I said my mom was sick and you immediately started talking about your yoga instructor? [Disappointed] Yeah, that kinda hurt.
[Sad] I just... I dunno, I thought friends were supposed to, you know, care about each other's stuff? [Sigh]
[Angry] No no no, don't even try to—you literally haven't asked me a single question all night! [Fast]
[Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if you'd even notice if I just... stopped showing up. [Slow] [Sad]
[Happy] Oh my god, you're right, MY problems don't matter because YOU had a rough day at brunch! [Sarcastic] [Laugh]
[Disappointed] I mean, I guess I could just record myself talking and you probably wouldn't know the difference, right? [Tsk]
[Shout] I GOT FIRED TODAY! [Slow] There, I said it—now can we actually talk about it?
[Chuckle] It's kinda impressive how you can turn literally any topic into something about yourself—like, that's a talent. [Sarcastic]
[Fast] You wanna know something funny? I've been making stuff up about my life just to see if you're even—yeah, you're not listening now either. [Sigh]
[Sad] I used to think you were just, um, enthusiastic about sharing, but now I'm starting to think you genuinely don't see me. [Disappointed]
[Angry] Honestly? I'm done pretending this is a friendship when it's basically just me being your unpaid therapist. [Groan] [Fast] I'm out.
Lightheartedly mentioning a thing they ordered online late at night, then checking the order, then seeing what they actually ordered, ending in impulse purchase horror
Okay, that's—that's not what happened. I didn't make her hide, she just ran when I kinda jumped back. I wasn't trying to scare her, I was literally just startled when she came at me.
Yeah well, I don't speak cat, okay? And you know—you KNOW I'm not good with animals. [frustrated laugh] But you're acting like I kicked her or something, which is honestly really unfair.
I didn't—okay okay, I raised my voice a little, but that's because she was climbing my leg! With claws! I'm sorry but that's a totally normal reaction when you're scared of something.
Right, and I get that it's your space, but like—you invited me over knowing how I am with pets. I mean, you could've at least warned me she was gonna be all over me the second I walked in.
Telling me you have a cat and preparing me for—for whatever that was are two different things. Look look, I'm trying here, I really am, but animals just freak me out and you've known this since forever. [sigh]
That's not—come on, don't twist my words. I wanna hang out with you, obviously, but maybe we could just... I dunno, put her in another room next time? Is that really such a huge ask?
Wow. Okay. So we're—we're going there now. Fine fine, but you're basically choosing your cat over your friend, which is... y'know what, whatever. I'm not gonna compete with a pet.
I said the fur on my jacket was—ugh, you're taking everything out of context! I have allergies, remember? Or did you conveniently forget that part while you're busy making me the villain here?
Okay so maybe I exaggerated a little about the allergies but that's because—because I didn't wanna hurt your feelings about being scared! [scoff] Guess that backfired, huh? I was trying to spare your feelings and now you're acting like I'm some kinda monster.
Yeah, I'm—I'm gonna go. But honestly? This is really disappointing. Like, I've been your friend for six years and you're ready to throw that away because I'm not great with your cat. That's... yeah. That's really something.
Oh god, okay—I can explain. I thought—I honestly thought you knew already! Like, everyone was talking about it and I just assumed—wait, that's not—[nervous laugh] I'm making this worse, aren't I?
No no no, that came out wrong. I didn't—I meant to tell you, I swear I did. But then it got weird because like, so much time had passed and I didn't know how to bring it up without it being this whole thing.
I know, I know. God, I'm such an idiot. I literally had like five different chances to mention it and I just—I kept chickening out because I knew you'd be upset that I hadn't said anything earlier, y'know?
Yeah. Which was—that was stupid. Really, really stupid. [Sigh] I don't even have a good excuse, honestly. I just kept putting it off and then suddenly it was Friday and everyone was getting ready and I realized how badly I'd messed up.
What? No—I mean, I didn't even really—I left early actually. I kept thinking about how you should've been there and it just felt wrong, you know? Like the whole night was kinda ruined because I knew I'd screwed up.
I deserve that. I do. But like—can I just say that it wasn't intentional? I would never deliberately exclude you from something, that's not—that's not who I am. Or who I wanna be. [Groan] I just handled this whole thing so badly.
I'm gonna—I'll make sure you know about everything from now on, okay? Like, even the stupid stuff. Even if I think you already know. I'll be that annoying friend who texts you about every single thing because I never want you to feel like this again.
No but I'm serious! I really—I hate that I made you feel left out. That's like, literally one of the worst feelings and I should've—I should've been a better friend. I'm sorry. Really, genuinely sorry.
You're right. You're totally right. It would've taken me like two seconds and I just—I overthought it, I guess? Made it this huge deal in my head when it didn't need to be. Classic me, making everything way more complicated than it needs to be. [nervous laugh]
I will. I promise I will. And um—there's actually this thing next weekend at Sarah's place if you wanna—sorry, see? I'm telling you! That's me being better already. Do you maybe wanna come? We could go together?
I know, I know, okay? The highway was literally a parking lot. There was this massive accident and they shut down two lanes—I couldn't even get off at an exit for like twenty minutes.
I did text! I sent you like three messages saying I was stuck. Check your phone. [frustrated laugh] I mean, what else was I supposed to do, abandon my car?
Okay, but how is that—look, I'm sorry about the reservation, but you're acting like I planned this. I left early, actually. I gave myself extra time and everything just went to hell anyway.
That's not—come on, that's not fair. When was the last time I was late? Seriously, tell me. Because I'm pretty sure I'm usually the one waiting for you half the time.
That was fifteen minutes! And I told you ahead of time my meeting was running over. This is different—this was literally [groan] an act of God or whatever. You can check the traffic reports if you don't believe me.
Okay okay, I get that you're pissed, but I was sitting in traffic going insane too, y'know? Like, you think I wanted to be stuck behind some guy's bumper stickers for forty minutes? I was stressed the whole time.
I—what? I just told you I left early! I gave myself like an extra twenty minutes, which is usually plenty. But apparently everyone decided to crash their cars today, so...
Oh, so now you think I'm lying? That's—wow, okay. You know what, I'm trying to explain what happened, but if you just wanna be mad, then fine. Be mad.
Tired of what, exactly? Traffic? Because yeah, me too. Or tired of—look look, I said I was sorry about the reservation. But honestly? You're being kinda unreasonable about something I literally couldn't control.
No, not whatever. I drove through hell to get here and you're treating me like I—[sigh] Fine. Let's go. But this isn't fair and you know it.
Do what? What are you even—I don't know what you're talking about. We were just hanging out, having a good time, and now you're acting like I committed some crime or something.
Yeah, and? I was happy for her! I literally said congrats like three times. But then everyone started talking about work stuff and I just—I dunno, I joined the conversation. That's what people do.
Okay okay, but she asked me about it! [scoff] She literally said "how's the job search going" and I answered. Was I supposed to just... not answer? That would've been weird.
It wasn't—come on, it wasn't twenty minutes. Maybe like five. And everyone seemed interested! They were asking questions and I was just... I mean, I thought we were having a conversation, y'know?
Don't do that. Don't just "sure" me like I'm some kind of—look, I get that you think I talk too much sometimes, but honestly? Sometimes it feels like you're keeping score or something. [frustrated laugh] Like you're just waiting for me to mess up.
Of what? Of me having insecurities? Of me being human? I'm sorry I'm not perfect like—okay, that's not fair, but neither is this. You're acting like I do this maliciously when really I'm just trying to connect with people.
That's—that's not what I'm doing. Or I mean, maybe sometimes it seems that way, but it's not on purpose. When I get nervous I just... I talk. And yeah, I talk about myself because that's what I know. [sigh] It's not because I think I'm so interesting.
Because I'm scared, okay? I'm scared that if I don't say something, anything, people are gonna realize I don't actually belong there. That I'm just—I dunno, faking it or whatever. So yeah, I overcompensate. I know I do.
I didn't mean to steal it. I really didn't. But also like—she got her moment! Everyone congratulated her, we toasted, the whole thing. I just... after that, I thought it was okay to share too. Apparently I was wrong.
Yeah well, you always think it's not. Maybe—maybe instead of getting all cold and angry every time, you could just... tell me? In the moment? Instead of letting me go on and then hating me for it later. That's kinda unfair too, y'know?
Wait wait wait—everything? Like, your entire shop? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! When did this happen?
I'm literally—okay, I'm getting goosebumps right now. This is huge! How are you feeling? You must be like, completely freaking out, right?
Weird how? Like good weird or—actually no, I get it. It's probably super overwhelming. Did you see it happening in real time?
[Laugh] Of course you thought it was broken! That's so—wait, how many pieces are we talking about here?
Forty—okay, um, that's basically your entire winter collection, right? Holy shit. Do you know what triggered it? Like was there a—did someone share it or something?
An influencer? Which one? Oh my god, you're gonna—you're gonna need to make so much more stuff now. [Groan] Your poor hands!
Oh no no no, that's—okay that's actually stressful. How long is that gonna take you? Do you need help? I can totally come over and like, help you pack things or whatever.
We're going to—I'm literally grabbing my keys right now. We're gonna hit up every shipping store in town, okay? This is like, this is your moment!
I mean, yeah, of course it doesn't! You just went from, what—selling a few pieces a week to boom, cleaned out? That's gotta be absolutely mind-blowing. Are you happy though? Like underneath all the—the panic?
You should be! This is—honestly? This is exactly what you deserve. [Softer] You've been working so hard on this stuff, and people finally noticed. That's not luck, babe. That's just... you being amazing at what you do.
discovering the thing they need requires batteries not included
[screaming] OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! [jumping up and down] Did we both just—did that really happen? [hysterical laughter] We're getting promoted at the same time—this is insane!
[shaking voice] My hands won't stop trembling. [quieter] Look at them! [explosive laugh] Remember when Johnson said we'd never make it past junior level? Where's your prophecy now, Johnson?
[whispered disbelief] Twenty percent raise. [gradually louder] Twenty. Percent. Raise. [shouting] I'm buying that car, taking that trip, and getting guac at Chipotle without thinking twice! This changes everything!
[sobbing with joy] I called my mom before coming here. [voice breaking] She started crying—happy tears—and then I started crying. [sniffling laugh] The whole bus thought I was having a breakdown!
[hushed awe] Can you imagine Monday's meeting? [gleefully] Walking in there as executives? [voice cracking] Thompson's face when he realizes we're now his equals—priceless, absolutely priceless!
[nervous giggle] What if they made a mistake? [panicked] What if they meant to promote Jennifer and Jennifer? [relieved exhale] No, no, I have the letter right here—it's real!
[melodramatic gasp] Our business cards will have "Senior Vice President" on them! [giddy whisper] Embossed lettering! [normal volume] I'm framing mine, laminating it, maybe even getting it tattooed somewhere!
[trembling excitement] My student loans are shaking right now. [fierce determination] They know their days are numbered! [victory cry] Sallie Mae, I'm coming for you with executive-level vengeance, baby!
[delirious laughter] I'm dizzy—actually physically dizzy from happiness! [steadying breath] Is that normal? [more laughter] Who cares, we're EXECUTIVES now—we probably have better health insurance for dizziness!
[emotional whisper] We said we'd do it together. [voice swelling] Through every terrible project, every weekend overtime— [crying and laughing] We actually kept that drunk promise from the holiday party!
[calmly] Sarah, take a deep breath, I'm Emma, your planner. [reassuring] Twelve weeks at the Rosewood venue on 4521 Oak Avenue is actually manageable. [more firmly] Let me pull up your timeline checklist—we can absolutely work through this.
[confidently] No, no, don't postpone! [soothing tone] Invitations can go out this week if we expedite with code RUSH24 for printing. [more enthusiastically] I have three florists on standby who can meet you tomorrow at 2 PM, 3:30, or 5 PM.
[understanding] Virtual consultations are perfect actually! [brighter] The florists can do video calls—let's schedule for 7 PM your time instead? [reassuringly] Meanwhile, I'll email you the invitation templates, just need to confirm your guest count is still 175?
[professionally] That's fine, the Rosewood ballroom holds up to 225. [in a gentle voice] I'll adjust your catering quote with Premier Foods—their package C-190 is actually $2,000 less than package D-200. [chuckles softly] Silver lining there!
[decisively] It's 567-8901, I'll call Jennifer directly after this. [warmly] She's probably just swamped with spring bookings, but your contract #JC-1847 is locked in. [more reassuringly] Everything's actually more on track than you think, Sarah.
[briskly] Good afternoon, this is Allied Loan Services, how can I— [quickly] I see you're calling about payment posting. [more warmly] Let me pull up your account right away, what's your loan number?
[rapidly] I see the account here, let me just— [pause] [more carefully] Yes, I show a pending payment from the 15th. [apologetically] Sometimes our system takes up to, um, fourteen business days to fully process.
[defensive] Sir, I understand your frustration, but the processing time is clearly stated in your loan agreement. [more quickly] Page twelve, section four-B. [softer] Would you like me to expedite this with my supervisor?
[hurriedly] Actually, wait, I'm seeing something here. [confused] Did you... did you send the payment to our old processing center? [more gently] We switched banks last month, sent out notices.
[speaking quickly] The payment will bounce back to your account within five to seven— [catching themselves] [more slowly] I mean, it's safe, don't worry. [reassuringly] We can waive the late fee once it's resolved.
[sympathetically] I wish I could, I really do. [more firmly] But the system won't let me override without the actual funds. [quickly] Let me create a case number for you, okay?
[uncomfortably] Sir, I— [pause] [more determined] You know what, hold on. [typing rapidly] I'm flagging this as urgent hardship, that should escalate it within twenty-four hours instead.
[earnestly] This is different, I'm putting my employee ID on it. [speaking faster] My direct extension is 4-5-5-1, ask for Marcus. [firmly] I'll personally track this tomorrow morning.
[confidently] It will work. [more quietly] Between you and me, I've seen this exact issue before. [quickly] The old bank still forwards payments, just slowly. Should hit by tomorrow afternoon.
[gently] I've noted everything in your file. [more assertively] When you call tomorrow, even if you don't reach me, any agent will see the urgent flag. [reassuringly] We'll get this sorted, I promise.
[Sad] I'm so, so sorry—I know how much this meant to you and I just... [Sigh] I completely screwed up the timing, didn't I?
[Fast] Okay so basically my alarm didn't go off and then the train was delayed and I—I ran here from the station! [Groan]
[Disappointed] This is, um, this is exactly what I promised wouldn't happen. [Slow] I really let you down today, huh?
[Whisper] Everyone's already seated and I'm just gonna have to walk in there like—god, this is mortifying. [Tsk]
[Angry] I can't believe my GPS took me to the wrong—wait, no, that's not an excuse. [Sigh] I should've left earlier, I know.
[Happy] Well, at least I made it before the, uh, before the main part started, right? [Chuckle] That's gotta count for something!
[Sarcastic] Oh great, now everyone gets to watch me do the walk of shame to my seat. [Slow] This is just perfect, really.
[Sad] My mom's gonna be so disappointed—she reminded me like three times yesterday and I still... [Whisper] I still managed to mess it up.
[Shout] I'm here, I'm here! [Fast] Sorry, sorry, the parking was absolutely insane and I had to circle for like twenty minutes!
[Disappointed] You know what the worst part is? [Tsk] I actually woke up on time and then just, I dunno, completely lost track of everything.
[Fast] Is there, um, is there any way I can sneak in without—actually, never mind, I'll just own it. [Laugh]
[Angry] The babysitter canceled last minute and I had to—[Slow] sorry, you don't need to hear my whole sob story right now.
[Happy] Hey, fashionably late is still a thing, right? [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] No? Okay, yeah, I deserve that look.
[Whisper] I literally had nightmares about being late to this and then it actually—[Groan] it actually happened.
[Sad] Can we just, like, pretend I've been here the whole time? [Fast] I'll be so quiet, nobody will even notice, I promise!
[Disappointed] Twenty years of friendship and this is how I show up for your big day. [Sigh] I'm honestly the worst.
[Shout] Don't start without—oh. [Whisper] Oh, you already started. [Tsk] Of course you did.
[Sarcastic] Traffic was totally unpredictable, who could've known there'd be cars on the road? [Sad] God, I'm such an idiot sometimes.
[Fast] I've got a really good explanation but, um, but honestly? [Slow] It doesn't matter because I should've been here regardless.
[Happy] At least I didn't miss the—wait, I didn't miss the important part yet, did I? [Disappointed] [Groan] Please tell me I didn't.
Complaining about a family member's criticism, then realizes they were trying to help in their own way
Oh god, I know—I'm so sorry. I can't believe I—wait, just let me explain what happened, okay? It's not an excuse but I swear there's a reason.
Two hours? Oh no no no, that's—[groan] that's even worse than I thought. I thought maybe you'd leave after like thirty minutes. I didn't realize you'd actually wait that long for me.
I know. God, I know it was and I—I literally hate myself right now. Like I had it in my calendar, I had three alarms set, I was gonna leave early and everything but then—okay this sounds so stupid now.
My ex showed up at my apartment. Like out of nowhere, just—just completely melting down about something and I tried to tell them I had to go but they wouldn't—[nervous laugh] sorry, that's not your problem. I should've just left anyway.
No! No, that's not—I didn't choose anyone, I just got stuck and I couldn't—I mean I could've but I didn't know how to just walk away when someone's crying and I kept thinking I'd make it if I could just calm them down real quick, y'know?
Please don't—okay, you have every right to be mad. Like genuinely, I would be furious if you missed something that important to me. I'm just—I'm really, really sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything.
I know, I know I should've. My phone died and I—that's such a cliché excuse, isn't it? [sigh] But I swear it's true. And by the time I got it charged and saw your messages it was already over and I just... I panicked.
I know it did. And you—you matter to me too, so much, which is why I can't believe I screwed this up so badly. Like, I keep replaying it and thinking about all the things I could've done differently.
I'm sorry. I'm just—I'm so sorry. I don't know what else to say except that I completely failed you and I—I wanna make it up to you somehow but I know I can't really make up for missing that. Can I... is there anything I can do?
Yeah, of course. Take—take all the time you need. I'll be here whenever you're ready to talk or if you need anything at all. And I'm gonna—I mean, if you'll let me, I'd really like to go visit her grave with you sometime. If that's okay.
Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? The super competitive one that—oh my god, are you serious right now?
I'm—okay, I'm literally about to cry. This is huge! Like, this is the biggest— [Gasp] how are you so calm? I'd be screaming!
No no no, don't do that thing where you downplay everything. This is like—do you even know how many people apply for this? You're basically a genius now.
Just two years of—are you kidding me? That's life-changing money! And the prestige, oh my god. Your resume is gonna be like, untouchable. Have you told your parents yet?
Okay but like—why? They're gonna lose their minds! In the best way! Unless... wait, are you having second thoughts about it?
Switzerland. You're going to— [Laugh] of course it's somewhere incredible. I mean, that's far but like... chocolate? Mountains? Come on.
So? You'll learn! That's—honestly that's just another skill you're gonna pick up. Plus everyone there speaks English anyway, right? I think? Actually, I dunno, but still!
Oh, babe. No. They picked you—out of probably thousands of people, they picked you. That's not luck, y'know? That's them seeing exactly what I see.
Someone who's brilliant but won't admit it? Like, you literally solve problems I can't even understand. And you're worried about—what, not being good enough? [Sigh] That's imposter syndrome talking.
I'm definitely right. And hey—worst case scenario? You hate it, you come back with an insane story and Swiss chocolate for me. Best case? You're gonna change the world or whatever. No pressure though.
Oh god, I—I didn't think it was gonna come out like that! I swear I was just trying to tell a funny story about game night and then—then it kinda spiraled and I couldn't stop myself.
I know, I know, that was—that was so stupid of me. I wasn't thinking about how it would sound, y'know? Like in my head it was just this cute story about how you thought Portugal was in South America but then—[nervous laugh]—okay, hearing myself say it now...
No no no, that's not—I mean, everyone has those moments, right? I literally thought reindeer were fake until I was like twenty! Remember? I told that story too but nobody was laughing at that the same way and—wait, that's not helping, is it?
Right. Of course. I'm just—I'm making this worse. [Sigh] Look, I genuinely didn't mean to embarrass you. I thought I was being funny and inclusive, like "hey, we all make mistakes" but I see now that I just... I threw you under the bus.
They don't! They—okay, maybe in that moment it was awkward but honestly? James came up to me after and said everyone has geography blindspots. And Lisa admitted she thought Alaska was an island for years because of how maps show it!
You're right, you're—you're totally right. The point is I betrayed your trust and I made you look bad in front of people you have to see every day. That's—god, that's actually really messed up of me. I wasn't thinking about consequences, I was just... running my mouth like always.
I gotta—I need to fix this somehow. What if I talk to them? Like individually? I could explain that I exaggerated or—or that I got the story wrong? Would that help? [Groan] I dunno, maybe that makes it worse...
Okay, okay, I won't—I won't do anything without asking you first. I promise. No more stories about you, no more trying to be the funny one at your expense. I get it now. I really—I really messed up here.
I know. And you—you deserve that, you work so hard and you're literally the smartest person I know. Geography thing aside—sorry, sorry, bad joke. But seriously, you're brilliant and I should've been building you up, not... not whatever that was. I'm really, really sorry.
Deal. Absolutely. I've got like—like a million of them anyway. Remember when I tried to shake hands with a mannequin? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I'll just... I'll stick to those. Are we—are we gonna be okay?
Wait, what? I—okay, I went, yeah, but I didn't think you'd—it wasn't like a planned thing. Jamie literally texted me last minute and I just... went.
Not everyone, come on. It was like—I dunno, maybe ten people? And honestly, I figured Jamie invited you too. I mean, why would I assume [scoff] you weren't invited?
Asked? Asked what—"hey, is my best friend invited to your party?" That's—that's weird. I'm not your social secretary, y'know? I just assumed you either couldn't make it or didn't wanna go.
Okay okay, fine, maybe I should've—but you're acting like I deliberately excluded you, which is literally not what happened. I was already there when I realized you weren't coming.
Because I was—look, I was already kinda drunk, and it felt weird to be like "hey, why aren't you here?" Like, what if you weren't invited? Then I'd just be rubbing it in your face. [frustrated laugh] I can't win here.
It's not an excuse, it's—ugh, it's what happened. I'm trying to explain that I didn't mean to hurt you, but apparently that doesn't matter because you've already decided I'm the worst friend ever.
You don't have to. You're—the way you're looking at me right now... [sigh] Look look, I get that you're upset. I do. But I'm kinda frustrated too because this wasn't intentional.
Um, yeah? It kinda does? There's a huge difference between "I don't care about your feelings" and "I made a dumb assumption." I mean, come on, we've been friends for how long?
I—okay, that's fair. That's... yeah. But you could also, I dunno, give me the benefit of the doubt here? Instead of just assuming I'm this terrible person who wanted to leave you out?
No, not—not whatever. Look, I'm sorry you got left out, okay? I am. But I'm also not gonna stand here and pretend like I did this horrible thing on purpose when we both know that's not what happened.
waiting for the dryer sheet static to go away
[quietly] Look at this—Dad's old watch. [voice cracking] Remember how he'd wind it every morning at breakfast? [Shaky exhale] I can still hear that little clicking sound echoing through the kitchen while Mom made coffee.
[strained whisper] His cologne bottle's still half full. [Bitter laugh] Thirty years of the same brand—Old Spice Classic. [voice breaking] Why does something so ordinary suddenly feel like it's ripping my chest apart?
[with forced brightness] Oh wow, his joke book! [trembling] "101 Dad Jokes for Every Occasion." [Choked laugh] He actually highlighted his favorites—look, this whole page about fishing puns is practically glowing yellow.
[suddenly urgent] We should keep the toolbox intact. Every screwdriver, [emphasizing each word] every random screw and washer. [steadier] I know it's junk mostly, but his hands touched all of it—organized it exactly this way.
[voice rising] Found the Father's Day cards we made as kids! [laughing through tears] Yours says "World's Okayest Dad" in crayon. [Watery chuckle] Mine just has a stick figure with enormous hands because I couldn't draw.
[hollow tone] His reading glasses are on page 847 of this Tom Clancy novel. [pause] [quieter still] He'll never know how it ends. Somehow that feels worse than everything else—that unfinished story just sitting here forever.
[fierce whisper] "Reservation at Romano's, yellow roses, [building emotion] chocolate soufflé for dessert." [Breaking down] He drew little stars next to each item like he always did for important things. How are we supposed to tell her?
[exhausted] I'm keeping his coffee mug. [defensive edge] The stupid one with the fishing joke that's barely readable anymore. [Wavering] Don't care if it's worthless—I need something for my morning coffee, something that was his.
[sudden realization] Oh no, his phone. [panicking] There's probably voicemails we haven't— [more controlled] Should we listen? What if there's something important, or what if hearing his voice just destroys us completely right now?
[bitter irony] Found his bucket list from five years ago. [quieter] "Learn Spanish, visit Ireland, [voice dropping] see the boys get married." [Harsh laugh] He crossed off Ireland at least. One out of three.
[apologetic] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [calmly] Let me pull up your account right away—that's 78234-KL9, correct? [reassuring] I see you're on our premium business plan, and yes, there's been an outage reported in the 4500 block area since Tuesday.
[sympathetic] I sincerely apologize for those incorrect updates, Mr., uh, Thompson. [more professionally] Our technicians found unexpected damage to the main fiber line near junction box J-447B. [hopeful tone] The good news is they're actually working on it as we speak.
[nervously] Well, I can't make absolute guarantees, but— [more confidently] let me check the latest tech update. [relieved] Okay, ticket number TK-9982341 shows 85% completion, estimated restoration by 3:30 PM today. [quickly] That's about two hours from now.
[understanding] I completely get why you're concerned about that meeting. [helpful] Would you like me to set up a mobile hotspot credit to your account—code MHS-COMP? [more enthusiastically] It's normally $30 but I'll waive it, plus I'm adding three months of free service for this inconvenience.
[reassuring] No catch at all, sir—it's compensation code COMP-3M-OUT applied directly. [informatively] The hotspot delivers up to 75 megabits, plenty for your conference. [more warmly] I'm also noting priority status on your repair, which means the senior tech, Rodriguez, badge R-1147, will personally verify your connection.
[professionally] Good afternoon, Willow Creek HOA, this is Janet speaking. [briskly] How may I assist you today?
[apologetically] Oh, Mr. Miller, let me just... [quickly] pull up your file here. [typing pause] Yes, I see your submission from October 3rd. [more hesitantly] It appears it's still under architectural review.
[defensively] Sir, I understand your frustration, but [more firmly] the committee only meets once a month. [quickly] Your application missed the October meeting by two days, so [trailing off] it's scheduled for November's agenda.
[calmly] Mr. Miller, these procedures are in place to ensure [speaking faster] all modifications meet community standards and property values are protected. [sympathetically] However, I can flag your application as urgent for the board's attention.
[more reassuringly] It means the board will review it first during the meeting. [briskly] Additionally, if you can email me your contractor's timeline, [helpfully] I might be able to request an emergency review—though that requires three board members' approval.
[honestly] Between you and me, Mr. Miller, [quietly] emergency reviews usually go through within 72 hours if the request is reasonable. [more optimistically] A simple deck addition shouldn't be controversial.
[quickly] Send it directly to my attention at janet.davis@willowcreekhoa.com. [efficiently] Include photos of the proposed area and [speaking faster] make sure to mention the storage fees you're incurring—the board responds well to financial hardship arguments.
[chuckles softly] Well, Mr. Miller, I've been here twelve years and [confidentially] I've learned which battles are worth fighting. [more seriously] Just get me that email and I'll do my best for you.
[reassuringly] They rarely reject decks unless there's a major code violation. [quickly] If they request modifications, [helpfully] we can usually resolve those within a week through email correspondence—no waiting for another meeting.
[understandingly] No apology necessary, Mr. Miller. [warmly] Trust me, if I had to wait six weeks for a deck approval, [chuckles] I'd be calling here pretty frustrated too.
[Nervous] Um, does anyone actually know if that emergency button, like—does it really work or is it just for show? [Laugh]
[Angry] This is literally the third time this month I've been—I'm filing a complaint with building management, I swear. [Groan]
[Happy] Well, at least we're not alone, right? [Chuckle] I mean, imagine being stuck in here by yourself—that'd be way worse!
[Whisper] Do you guys hear that creaking sound or is it just—oh god, please tell me you hear it too. [Fast]
[Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, my phone's at two percent, because of course it is. [Tsk] This day just keeps getting better.
[Slow] So, uh, anyone here actually claustrophobic? [Sad] Because I'm kinda starting to feel it now, honestly.
[Disappointed] I had a job interview in—actually, forget it, they're never gonna believe this excuse anyway. [Sigh]
[Fast] Okay so basically my wife's gonna think I'm lying about being stuck because last week I said I was stuck in traffic when I wasn't—this is bad. [Groan]
[Shout] HELLO? CAN ANYONE OUT THERE HEAR US? [Angry] WE'RE BETWEEN FLOORS THREE AND FOUR!
[Chuckle] Y'know, this is actually kinda like that episode of The Office where—wait, did anyone else watch that show?
[Sad] My daughter's recital starts in twenty minutes and I promised her I'd—I promised I wouldn't miss another one. [Sigh]
[Sarcastic] Sure, let's all just breathe each other's recycled air for the next hour, that sounds super fun. [Disappointed]
[Happy] Hey, wanna play twenty questions while we wait? [Fast] I mean, we gotta do something to pass the time, right?
[Whisper] I really, really need to use the bathroom—like, this is gonna get embarrassing real quick if we don't get out soon. [Tsk]
[Slow] You ever notice how elevator music just... stops when something goes wrong? [Chuckle] Like even the music abandons ship.
[Angry] [Fast] I told them—I literally told maintenance last week that this thing was making weird noises but did they listen? No!
[Disappointed] I guess my ice cream's gonna be completely melted by the time we—wait, can you suffocate in these things? [Whisper]
[Happy] This'll be a great story for dinner parties though—"Remember that time I got trapped with five strangers?" [Laugh]
[Sad] [Slow] My anxiety meds are in my car, so this is, um... this is gonna be interesting.
[Shout] PRESS THE BUTTON AGAIN! [Sarcastic] Maybe it just needs some aggressive encouragement to start working!
Casually describing a screenshot they took of a conversation, then checking their camera roll, then finding they accidentally sent it to the person, spiraling into screenshot horror
I—okay, I did say that, but it's not—it's not that simple, alright? I mean, I do like it! I just... maybe not as much as I said I did?
No no no, not lied, I just—I exaggerated? A little? You were so excited and I didn't wanna—I couldn't just tell you it wasn't my thing, y'know? [nervous laugh] That would've been cruel.
That's—that's not what I meant to do. I swear, I was trying to be supportive! Like, you worked so hard on it and I could see how proud you were and I just... I dunno, I got caught up in the moment.
I know, I know you did. And I should've—god, I should've just been straight with you. But honestly? I was scared, okay? You're kinda intimidating when it comes to your art and I didn't—[sigh] I didn't wanna disappoint you.
Oh. Oh shit. I—that was... okay, I can explain that. I was venting, and I didn't mean—wait wait, that sounds bad. Um. I wasn't trying to talk behind your back or anything, Marcus just asked and I was being stupid.
I didn't—I mean, technically I said "amateurish" which is—no, sorry, that's not better. Christ. Look, I'm an idiot, alright? A complete idiot who doesn't know anything about art anyway so why does my opinion even matter?
I know. [quieter] I know it did. And that's—that's why I feel so terrible right now. Like, genuinely sick to my stomach. You trusted me to be honest and I just... I blew it. I completely blew it.
Oh my god. Oh my god, I didn't—you didn't tell me you were gonna do that! I mean, not that it's your fault, obviously it's not, but I—if I'd known you were gonna... shit. I'm so sorry. Like, so incredibly sorry.
Please don't—please don't hate me? I know I messed up, I really really do, but I wanna make this right. Whatever you need me to do, I'll do it. You want me to call those galleries? Tell them I'm an idiot who knows nothing?
Yes. Absolutely. I promise—and I mean actually promise this time—I will never, ever do that again. Even if it's hard, even if I think it might hurt your feelings... you deserve the truth. [pause] Your friendship means everything to me, y'know? I just—I really hope I haven't ruined it.
Oh. Um, okay—look, before you freak out, it wasn't even a party. It was literally just like five people who happened to be at Jake's place, and it just kinda...happened.
Yeah, it did actually. We were gonna watch the game and then—I dunno, people started showing up and [sigh] I know how it looks, but it wasn't some planned thing where I deliberately didn't invite you.
No, that's—that's not how it went down. Jake texted me last minute, like an hour before, and I was already in the neighborhood. I mean, was I supposed to be like "hold on, let me invite everyone I know"?
Okay okay, maybe I could've, but honestly? You've been super busy lately and you literally told me last week you were burnt out on social stuff. So I figured—wrongly, apparently—that you wouldn't even wanna come.
Fine, you're right, it's not. But you're acting like I'm this terrible friend when I was actually trying to respect what you said. [frustrated laugh] I can't win here.
Sam was Jake's roommate's plus one! I didn't even know he was gonna be there until I showed up. Look look, I get that you're hurt, and maybe I should've—I probably should've texted you. But this feels kinda unfair.
Yeah, unfair. Because you're making it sound like we all got together and decided to exclude you, which is not what happened. At all. And honestly? You've bailed on the last three things we invited you to.
How? How is that different? You don't show up when we invite you, but then get mad when—okay, y'know what, that came out wrong. [groan] I'm not trying to attack you here.
Well I'm—I'm frustrated too, okay? Because I feel like no matter what I do lately, you're disappointed in me. And yeah, maybe I messed up this time, but you're not exactly making it easy to apologize.
You're right. I haven't. Because honestly? Part of me doesn't think I should have to. But I am sorry you're hurt. I am. I just—I wish you could see that it wasn't about you.
Oh! Oh no, wait—which ones? I posted like a bunch from last night and I thought they were all really cute! Did I—did I miss something?
That's not—okay, you don't look like that at all! I mean, maybe the lighting was a little weird but I honestly thought you looked great! I wouldn't have posted them if I didn't think—
Yeah, yeah of course, I'm literally doing it right now. [nervous laugh] I'm so sorry, I should've asked you first. I just got excited because we haven't hung out in forever and I wanted to—but that's not an excuse.
I know, I know, I'm the worst. Like genuinely, I feel terrible. I was just—I dunno, I was going through them really quick this morning and I thought they were fine but clearly I wasn't paying attention and that's on me.
That's not—I mean, that wasn't intentional! I swear I wasn't trying to make myself look better than you or anything like that. You know I would never—[groan] okay, I can see how it looks though.
No no no, please don't be mad. I'm deleting them right now, see? Gone. And I'll—I'll post that really good one of you from dinner last week instead, the one where you're laughing? You look amazing in that one.
You're right, you're totally right. The point is I should've checked with you first. I just—I get so carried away with posting stuff immediately and I don't think about—god, I'm such an idiot sometimes.
I know. I should've texted you or—or shown them to you before I posted anything. That's like, basic friend etiquette and I completely failed. I'm really, really sorry. [sigh] I honestly didn't mean to make you feel bad.
Oh my god, no. No no no, that's—that's awful. I'm so sorry. Listen, I'll post something right now about how my phone camera was being weird or—wait, that sounds stupid. Um, what if I just post a bunch of really good ones of you?
I will. I promise I will, every single time. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna go through and delete any other ones where you don't look perfect, okay? Like, I mean it. I really am sorry. You know I love you, right?
realizing they scheduled two things at the same time
[whispering] I can't believe it. [Shaky exhale] All those boys we couldn't save, Thomas with his letters from home still unopened. [louder, breaking] What do we tell their mothers now? That it ended too late?
[angrily] Hours! [Choking sob] We lost twelve men this morning alone—for what? [in a whisper] They knew it was coming at eleven o'clock. The generals knew and they still sent them over the top.
[hollowly] Home. [nervous laugh] I don't even remember what my mother's kitchen smells like anymore. [growing desperate] All I know is carbolic acid, gangrene, and that sweet smell when the gas victims come in.
[gently] Yes, we did save some. [voice strengthening] Maybe a thousand men between us who'll see their families again. [Shuddering sigh] But Mary, I keep seeing the faces of all the others haunting these tent walls.
[firmly] They deserve to celebrate—God knows they've sacrificed enough. [voice dropping] But you're right, it feels strange. [Soft sob] My brother won't be coming back to join them. Passchendaele took him last year, remember?
[laughing through tears] Acid, yes—that's exactly it. [more controlled] The newspapers will call us heroes, angels of mercy. [Bitter chuckle] But angels shouldn't know how to tourniquets so fast, or recognize death's approach by smell alone.
[thoughtfully] Perhaps we're not meant to make sense of it. [voice breaking] Maybe we just carry it with us forever, like shrapnel too deep to remove. [more steadily] At least we'll carry it together—promise me that?
[gratefully] The nightmares—God, they'll be awful won't they? [rapidly] Every time I close my eyes I see that boy from Birmingham. [Whimper] Eighteen years old, crying for his mother while his intestines spilled through my fingers.
[quietly] You're right, I know you're right. [growing emotional] But Mary, what if I forget their faces? [Panicked breath] What if time makes them fade and all this suffering becomes meaningless, just another chapter in history books?
[peacefully] Yes. [Deep exhale] We'll be their living memorial, won't we? [with determination] Every breath we take from now on is one they should have had. [trembling] So we'd better make them count, hadn't we, Mary?
[professionally] I understand your concern, let me pull up Emma's file right away. [sympathetic] Account 4K7892B, yes, I see she's been working with Mr. Davidson. [calmly] Can you tell me which specific areas you feel aren't improving?
[concerned] Those scores are certainly not what we'd expect to see. [thoughtfully] I'm looking at Mr. Davidson's progress reports here, and he notes that Emma has been, um... [hesitantly] arriving late to about half the sessions?
[diplomatically] Of course, punctuality is just one factor we consider. [reassuringly] Let me check something else—I see the sessions are scheduled for 4:30 PM at 1845 Maple Street. [curiously] Has Emma been completing the assigned homework between sessions?
[professionally] Our satisfaction guarantee does cover situations like this, absolutely. [helpfully] I can offer you three options: switch to a different tutor, maybe Ms. Chen who has a 94% success rate, [optimistically] or we could try a different approach with two sessions weekly?
[apologetically] I completely understand the investment you've made. [more warmly] Actually, if we move to twice weekly, I can apply discount code EDU2024X for 20% off. [encouragingly] Ms. Chen also offers a free assessment session to identify exactly where the gaps are.
[confidently] That means 94% of her students improve by at least one letter grade within eight sessions. [enthusiastically] She specializes in calculus actually, and—[more quietly] between you and me, she's much better than Mr. Davidson with struggling students.
[efficiently] Absolutely, I'm creating case number TUT-20241108-3921 right now. [cheerfully] Ms. Chen has availability Tuesday and Thursday at 5:00 PM, same location. [helpfully] Should I schedule Emma's free assessment for this Tuesday, November 12th?
[understandingly] That's completely fair, and we encourage parent involvement actually. [professionally] I'm sending confirmation to your email at mrodriguez74@gmail. [reassuringly] I'll also include Ms. Chen's direct extension, 4412, so you can communicate any concerns immediately.
[empathetically] You're not being difficult at all—you're being a concerned parent. [warmly] I have teenagers myself, I completely understand. [confidently] Let's give Ms. Chen these eight sessions, and if there's no improvement, we'll provide a full refund for those sessions.
[cheerfully] Perfect, it's all documented in case TUT-20241108-3921. [professionally] You'll receive the confirmation email within five minutes, and Ms. Chen will call you personally before Tuesday. [warmly] Thank you for giving us another chance—Emma's success is our priority too.
[professionally] Good afternoon, this is Sarah from Henderson Accounting. [briskly] I see you've contacted us about missing documents for your tax filing. [reassuringly] Let me pull up your account right away to help you.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [quickly] Looking at your file now... okay, I see here that we sent them on the 15th. [confused] Did you check your email spam folder by any chance?
[calmly] Alright, let me verify the email we have on file. [speaking rapidly] Is it mchen at globaltech dot com? [pause] Wait, actually I'm seeing here... oh, there might be an issue with our server that day.
[reassuringly] Absolutely, I can do that right now. [typing quickly] I'm... I'm actually going to send them two ways—email and our secure portal. [more firmly] You'll have them within five minutes, I guarantee it.
[earnestly] No, no, that won't be necessary at all. [speaking briskly] I'm personally handling this—sending now... and... done! [confidently] Check your email right now, and I'll stay on the line to confirm you receive it.
[Angry] You know what, I'm just—I'm done explaining myself to people who've already decided what I'm capable of. [Groan]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just, um, pretend to be shocked when I actually pull this off, right? [Tsk]
[Happy] Wait till they see what I've been working on—honestly, their faces are gonna be priceless! [Laugh]
[Disappointed] I thought you'd at least, like, give me a chance before writing me off completely. [Sigh]
[Fast] Okay so basically everyone thinks I can't do it but they don't know I've already—never mind, they'll see. [Chuckle]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda like when they underestimate me—makes winning so much sweeter, y'know?
[Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, um, if I'm really as capable as I think or if they're right. [Slow] [Sigh]
[Shout] I got the promotion! [Happy] All those people who said I wasn't ready can just—yeah! [Laugh]
[Angry] [Fast] No no no, you don't get to act surprised now when I told you I could handle this months ago!
[Sarcastic] I mean, why would anyone think the youngest person here might actually have, oh I dunno, fresh ideas? [Tsk] [Disappointed]
[Slow] The thing is—look, I've been doing this quietly, successfully, for like three years now without anyone noticing.
[Happy] You should've seen his face when I started speaking fluent Mandarin—he literally thought I was just the intern! [Laugh] [Fast]
[Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna quit and go somewhere that'll, you know, actually see what I bring to the table.
[Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I thought that after everything I've accomplished, they'd finally start to, um, take me seriously.
[Angry] [Shout] Five patents! I have five patents and they still treat me like I'm some kind of—ugh!
[Chuckle] Funny how they're all scrambling to work with me now that I've, uh, basically saved the company. [Sarcastic]
[Fast] [Happy] Did you hear what Jennifer said about my presentation—wait, she actually called it brilliant, can you believe that?
[Sad] My own family doesn't even think I can—I mean, they literally laughed when I told them my plans. [Groan]
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let's all pretend that the "surprising success" wasn't something I'd been telling everyone would happen for months.
[Whisper] Honestly? Part of me wants to fail just to, like, prove them right so they'll leave me alone. [Sigh] [Disappointed]
Matter-of-factly talking about a drain running slow, then looking at it, then seeing the hair buildup and gagging, ending in drain disgust
Wait wait wait—THE app? The one you've been like, basically living and breathing for the past what, eight months? Oh my god, how are you feeling right now?
Decent? Are you—okay you're being so casual about this but like, this is huge! I mean, you literally built this thing from nothing. [Laugh] Give me numbers, what's decent?
Twenty thou—holy shit. That's not decent, that's like... that's incredible! Wait, is that good? I feel like that's really good, right?
Above projections, he says. You're just gonna—okay, you're gonna sit there and act like you didn't just absolutely crush it? This is so typical of you, honestly.
No no no, we're not—we're not doing the doom spiral thing today. Can you just like, I dunno, let yourself be happy for five seconds? [Sigh] You've earned this.
Yeah, I bet you're—actually, when's the last time you actually slept? Like really slept, not that weird couch nap thing you do.
Okay that's—Jesus, that's not okay. You're gonna crash so hard. But also like, I get it? The adrenaline must be absolutely insane right now.
See? See, there it is! [Laugh] You're trying so hard not to smile right now but I can hear it. That's gotta feel amazing, having strangers actually use your thing.
Weird how? Like scary-weird or like—wait, are you having one of those moments where it doesn't feel real? Because that's totally normal, y'know?
Done for now, maybe. But knowing you? You're probably already thinking about version two, aren't you? God, you're such a—you're impossible, but I'm so fucking proud of you.
Oh. Um, yeah, I meant to tell you about that—I know how it looks, but it's not like I just stole it from you. We worked on that together, remember?
Because you weren't—look, you weren't even gonna be there! The opportunity came up and I had to make a call. Was I supposed to just let it pass?
I did! I literally said "we" like five times, but okay, maybe I should've been more [sigh] explicit about it. But honestly, you're acting like I planned this whole thing behind your back.
That's—no. No, I didn't. Come on, we've been bouncing ideas off each other for months. I thought that's what we do, y'know? Share stuff, build on it together.
I'm not taking credit for—okay okay, fine. Maybe I got carried away in the moment. But you gotta understand, they put me on the spot and I just... ran with it.
Because we developed them tog—[frustrated laugh] you know what? Yeah. Some of those were yours. But some were mine too, and you're conveniently forgetting that part.
Was it though? 'Cause I remember us sitting at that coffee shop, both of us throwing out ideas, and it kinda just... emerged. I mean, I'm not saying you didn't contribute, but—
No, wait—I'm trying to explain here. You're mad, I get it, but you're also not being fair about what actually happened. This was collaborative until suddenly it's not?
I went solo because I had to! And honestly? [scoff] I'm getting pretty frustrated that you can't see that. Like, I'm sorry I didn't handle it perfectly, but I'm not gonna apologize for taking an opportunity.
Don't—don't do that. Look look, I know I messed up the communication part, okay? I should've told you first. But acting like I'm some kinda thief when we've literally always shared ideas... that hurts too, y'know?
That's not—okay, that's not even true. I told like, two people, and honestly? I wasn't ready to tell anyone, but they kinda figured it out on their own.
Don't do that. Don't just—look, I know you're pissed, but you're acting like I deliberately excluded you when that's not what happened. I wasn't ready to talk about it with you specifically because I knew you'd—[sigh] I knew you'd make it into this whole thing.
No, I mean—ugh, that's not what I meant and you know it. I mean you'd wanna fix everything immediately and sometimes I just need to, like, sit with stuff before I'm ready for that kind of help, y'know?
You literally always push. Always. And usually that's—fine, whatever, but this time I needed space and I'm not gonna apologize for taking it.
It wasn't about you! God, why does everything have to be—[frustrated laugh] I was dealing with my own shit, okay? And yeah, maybe I should've said something sooner, but I wasn't ready. I wasn't.
They found out by accident! Marcus saw me at the clinic and Jen—she basically cornered me when I was crying in my car. It's not like I planned some secret meeting without you.
And said what? "Hey, so I've been going through this massive thing but please don't ask questions or try to help"? Come on. You would've been at my door with like, soup and self-help books within the hour.
Yeah, well, sometimes—sometimes I don't want that. Sometimes I need to figure things out without someone hovering, and I'm allowed to do that. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings but I'm not sorry for needing boundaries.
What else would you—okay okay, fine. You wanna be mad? Be mad. But I was drowning, alright? [quieter] And I knew if I told you, you'd try to save me before I even figured out if I wanted to be saved.
I know. I know you did. And maybe I should've—I dunno, handled it better. But I was barely handling it at all, so... yeah. That's all I got.
I didn't—okay, yeah, I called them, but only because you were having that panic attack last week and I thought—I was trying to help. You were literally crying about how you weren't ready.
Look look, I get that you're mad, but you were—you couldn't even breathe when you talked about it. I was worried about you. [Sigh] Maybe I should've asked first, but honestly, you weren't exactly in a state to make decisions.
That's not—come on, that's not what I meant and you know it. I've watched you push yourself into these situations that make you miserable, and I just... I dunno, I thought I was being a good friend.
By caring enough to [frustrated laugh] actually do something when you're struggling instead of just watching you fall apart. But fine, apparently that makes me the bad guy here.
Because you needed—okay okay, I see how that looks now, but you kept saying you wanted to go and then backing out, and your mom has good insurance, so I thought... I mean, was it really that terrible that she knows?
Well I didn't—I didn't know it was gonna be this huge thing. You talk about wanting help all the time, and then you never actually... whatever. I'm sorry I tried to make it easier for you.
I'm not mad, I'm just—I'm frustrated because you're acting like everything I did was some kind of... control thing, when really I was just trying to—y'know what, forget it.
Trying to help someone who won't help themselves. There, I said it. And maybe that's—maybe that's not my job or whatever, but watching you stuck in the same patterns over and over is honestly exhausting sometimes.
That's not... [Groan] See, this is what you do. I'm not saying I wanna stop being your friend, I'm saying that maybe—just maybe—you could try to see that I wasn't coming from a bad place here.
No, but they should count for something, right? Like, I messed up, fine, but you're treating me like I'm some kind of—I dunno, like I'm your enemy instead of someone who actually gives a shit about you.
trying to decide if they should buy the extended warranty
[mortified whisper] Jeremy, please keep your voice down. [urgently] Everyone's staring at us, and she's standing right there by the kitchen. [Nervous laugh] Can't you just leave fifteen percent like a normal person for once in your life?
[exasperated] She's a single mom working doubles! [pleading tone] I talked to her last week when you were in the bathroom. [Heavy sigh] Your "economics lesson" means her kid might not get new school shoes this month.
[through gritted teeth] Five dollars? [increasingly agitated] You spent forty dollars on that bottle of wine alone! [Bitter laugh] But God forbid you leave an extra three bucks for someone who served us for ninety minutes straight.
[quietly seething] You know what? [building volume] I'm done being embarrassed every single time we go out. [Shaky breath] This is the last dinner I'm having with you until you learn basic human decency and social awareness.
[firmly] I'm going back inside. [determined] I'm leaving her a proper tip and apologizing for your behavior. [Disgusted sigh] And yes, I'm ending our restaurant outings because I can't stand watching you humiliate hardworking people anymore.
[coldly] It's not virtue signaling, Jeremy. [measured tone] It's called not being a complete asshole to service workers. [Tired exhale] You make six figures but act like leaving twenty percent will bankrupt you somehow.
[incredulous] Sob story? [voice cracking] She's a human being trying to make rent! [Frustrated groan] You spent two hundred dollars on those concert tickets last week but calculate tips down to the penny like Scrooge.
[sarcastically sweet] Oh, I understand perfectly. [building anger] You value your entertainment over people's livelihoods. [Dry laugh] That waitress will definitely remember you too—as the cheap jerk from table twelve who stiffed her.
[wearily] But we're not in other countries, are we? [firmly] We're here, where servers make two dollars an hour. [Deep breath] I'm done arguing—enjoy eating alone from now on, because I won't be joining.
[walking away] Fiscal responsibility? [disgusted whisper] You're just cheap, Jeremy. [Hollow laugh] And lonely—because nobody wants to be seen in public with someone who treats people like they're beneath them. Goodbye.
I—okay, yes, but it's not—it wasn't my secret to tell, you know? Like, I wanted to tell you so badly, I swear, but they made me promise and I just—I couldn't break that promise.
No no no, that's not—god, that came out wrong. [nervous laugh] Your trust means everything to me, okay? I just got stuck in this impossible situation where I—I literally didn't know what to do.
I know, I know. I should've. I mean, looking back now it seems so obvious but at the time I was just—I was trying to protect everyone and I ended up hurting you instead and that's... that's the worst part.
What? No! No, absolutely not. It was just me and—okay, well, Jamie knew too but only because they were there when it happened. But that's it, I swear. [groan] This is coming out all wrong.
It wasn't like that though! We weren't, like, conspiring against you or anything. I actually—I fought with them about it, honestly. Multiple times. I kept saying we should tell you but they were so scared and I just... I dunno, I caved.
You're right. You're completely right and I—there's literally no excuse good enough, is there? I messed up. I messed up so badly and I've been kinda losing my mind about it ever since.
I wasn't lying! I mean—okay, omission is basically lying, I get that. But I was gonna tell you, I swear. [sigh] I just kept waiting for the right time and then more time passed and it got harder and harder to bring up.
That's—ouch. Okay. Fair. I deserve that. I just... you have to know that keeping this from you has been eating me alive, right? Like, every single day I wanted to tell you but I was terrified of—well, of exactly this happening.
No! Well—maybe? God, I don't know anymore. I think I convinced myself I was protecting you somehow but really I was just—I was being a coward. A terrible, horrible friend and a coward. I'm so, so sorry.
We do! We still do, I promise. This was just—this one stupid thing that spiraled out of control and I handled it all wrong. But I wanna fix this. Please. You're like, my best friend and I can't—I can't lose you over this. Tell me how to make it right.
True, but—okay fine, but this was different and you know it. This film is like, it's special. And honestly? I think you're just now realizing how special.
Wait wait wait—what? Are you serious? Oh my god, that's—that's huge! Like, who is it? Is it one of those, um, mattress companies or—no wait, let me guess!
Shut up! That's so—honestly? That's perfect for you guys. You're always talking about food anyway, right? [Laugh] How much are they paying? Or wait, can you even tell me that?
Okay okay, but like—how are you feeling about it? Because this is literally what you've been working toward for, what, two years now? You must be kinda freaking out.
Weird how? Like weird that it's actually happening or weird like—oh no, are you having that thing where you think you don't deserve it? Because you totally do.
No no no, stop. That's not—[Sigh] okay, you know what? Everyone has sponsors now. It's literally how creators survive. You're not selling out, you're just... growing up? If that makes sense?
That's it? That's nothing! I mean, some podcasts do like, five-minute reads and you just—you just tune out completely. Thirty seconds is actually pretty respectful, y'know?
Oh, they're making you read a script? That's—hmm. Can you at least make it sound like you? Because honestly, your whole vibe is being authentic, right? That's why people listen.
See? That's actually—that's good! You can make it funny or whatever. Like, remember that one episode where you guys went off about meal prep for like twenty minutes? [Chuckle] This is basically the same thing but you're getting paid.
Of course they have—wait, three? That's so them. But like, are you gonna celebrate at all? This is literally such a big deal and you're just sitting here all... reserved about it.
Um, yes? Obviously yes! Oh my god, I'm so—I'm really proud of you, okay? Even if you're being all weird and modest about it. This is huge and you totally, totally earned it.
Wait, what? What are you—I literally have no idea what you're talking about. Did something happen? Because if it did, I genuinely didn't see anything about it.
You got—okay, first of all, congratulations, that's huge. But also, how was I supposed to know? I've been off social media for like two weeks, you know that. [frustrated laugh] I told you I was doing that digital detox thing.
Are you seriously—wow, okay. That's not fair. I didn't even know there was news to see. You're acting like I ignored it on purpose when I literally, literally had no clue.
I mean—yeah, maybe, but that's not the same as deliberately not congratulating you. Come on, there's a difference between not reaching out for a few days and actively [scoff] avoiding your success or whatever you think I did.
Because everyone else is glued to their phones! Look look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but I'm kinda frustrated here too because—I dunno, it feels like you're punishing me for trying to take care of my mental health.
Isn't it though? Because if I'd been scrolling Instagram like usual, I would've seen it and—and obviously I would've said something. You know I would've. We've been friends for eight years.
To call you about news I didn't know existed? That's—okay okay, I hear how it looks from your side, but you could've told me directly too, y'know? Like, a text? "Hey, got promoted"? Instead of expecting me to just... know.
That's not—[sigh] nobody's asking you to beg. But I can't support something I don't know about. And honestly? I'm a little hurt that your first assumption was that I don't care, not that maybe I just... missed it.
What's that supposed to mean? No, seriously, if you've got other issues with me, just—just say it. Because right now it feels like you're using this as an excuse to be mad about other stuff.
No, I don't wanna forget it. Look, I'm sorry I didn't see your news, okay? I am. But I'm not gonna apologize for taking a break from social media, and I'm definitely not gonna pretend like you're being totally reasonable here either.
Wait, what? I—no no no, I wasn't laughing AT you, I swear. It was just—the timing was so weird and I didn't know what else to—
Oh god. Oh god, I know. I'm—I'm literally the worst person alive right now. It wasn't—I wasn't laughing at that, I promise you. My brain just like... short-circuited? [nervous laugh] Sorry, that's not funny either.
No, please—just let me explain. You know how I get when I'm uncomfortable, right? Like, I do that stupid nervous laugh thing when I don't know how to—when things get too heavy and I just... I panicked.
That's not—okay, yes, but not like that. Not like I didn't wanna hear it or anything. I just didn't know what to say and my body just—it just reacted before my brain could catch up, y'know? I'm so, so sorry.
I know. I know and I completely failed you and I—[sigh] honestly, I've been replaying it in my head all night. Like, the look on your face when I... god, I'm such an idiot.
I really wanna fix this. I mean, I dunno if I even can, but like—you're one of my best friends and I just... I reacted wrong. Sometimes I laugh when I'm supposed to cry, it's this weird thing I've always—that's not an excuse though.
No, it's really not. And I should've—I should've just shut up and hugged you or something. Literally anything would've been better than what I did. Your dad's gonna be okay though, right? I mean—sorry, is it okay to ask that?
Yeah... yeah, of course it is. [quieter] I'm really, really sorry about your dad. And about being the world's worst friend when you needed me.
The absolute worst timing. But I'm—I'm here now, okay? Like, actually here. Whatever you need, whenever you need it. I promise I won't laugh or make it weird or—I'll just listen. I can do that.
Yeah, tomorrow. Definitely. And um... thank you. For like, not completely writing me off. I know I don't deserve—just, thank you. And I really am sorry.
