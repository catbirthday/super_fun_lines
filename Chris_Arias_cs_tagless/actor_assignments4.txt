Character 1: You made my cat hide for three hours.

262 Character 2: Okay, that's—that's not what happened. I didn't make her hide, she just ran when I kinda jumped back. I wasn't trying to scare her, I was literally just startled when she came at me.

Character 1: She was saying hello.

263 Character 2: Yeah well, I don't speak cat, okay? And you know—you KNOW I'm not good with animals. [frustrated laugh] But you're acting like I kicked her or something, which is honestly really unfair.

Character 1: You screamed at her.

264 Character 2: I didn't—okay okay, I raised my voice a little, but that's because she was climbing my leg! With claws! I'm sorry but that's a totally normal reaction when you're scared of something.

Character 1: In my own apartment.

265 Character 2: Right, and I get that it's your space, but like—you invited me over knowing how I am with pets. I mean, you could've at least warned me she was gonna be all over me the second I walked in.

Character 1: I told you I had a cat. Multiple times.

266 Character 2: Telling me you have a cat and preparing me for—for whatever that was are two different things. Look look, I'm trying here, I really am, but animals just freak me out and you've known this since forever. [sigh]

Character 1: So my home's off limits now?

267 Character 2: That's not—come on, don't twist my words. I wanna hang out with you, obviously, but maybe we could just... I dunno, put her in another room next time? Is that really such a huge ask?

Character 1: She lives here. You don't.

268 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So we're—we're going there now. Fine fine, but you're basically choosing your cat over your friend, which is... y'know what, whatever. I'm not gonna compete with a pet.

Character 1: You called her disgusting.

269 Character 2: I said the fur on my jacket was—ugh, you're taking everything out of context! I have allergies, remember? Or did you conveniently forget that part while you're busy making me the villain here?

Character 1: You don't have allergies. You lied.

270 Character 2: Okay so maybe I exaggerated a little about the allergies but that's because—because I didn't wanna hurt your feelings about being scared! [scoff] Guess that backfired, huh? I was trying to spare your feelings and now you're acting like I'm some kinda monster.

Character 1: Just go.

271 Character 2: Yeah, I'm—I'm gonna go. But honestly? This is really disappointing. Like, I've been your friend for six years and you're ready to throw that away because I'm not great with your cat. That's... yeah. That's really something.

Script: 1b29dc3e_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Everyone knew about Jake's party except me.

272 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I can explain. I thought—I honestly thought you knew already! Like, everyone was talking about it and I just assumed—wait, that's not—[nervous laugh] I'm making this worse, aren't I?

Character 1: You assumed.

273 Character 2: No no no, that came out wrong. I didn't—I meant to tell you, I swear I did. But then it got weird because like, so much time had passed and I didn't know how to bring it up without it being this whole thing.

Character 1: It's a whole thing now.

274 Character 2: I know, I know. God, I'm such an idiot. I literally had like five different chances to mention it and I just—I kept chickening out because I knew you'd be upset that I hadn't said anything earlier, y'know?

Character 1: So you said nothing at all.

275 Character 2: Yeah. Which was—that was stupid. Really, really stupid. [Sigh] I don't even have a good excuse, honestly. I just kept putting it off and then suddenly it was Friday and everyone was getting ready and I realized how badly I'd messed up.

Character 1: Did you have fun at least?

276 Character 2: What? No—I mean, I didn't even really—I left early actually. I kept thinking about how you should've been there and it just felt wrong, you know? Like the whole night was kinda ruined because I knew I'd screwed up.

Character 1: Good.

277 Character 2: I deserve that. I do. But like—can I just say that it wasn't intentional? I would never deliberately exclude you from something, that's not—that's not who I am. Or who I wanna be. [Groan] I just handled this whole thing so badly.

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

278 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'll make sure you know about everything from now on, okay? Like, even the stupid stuff. Even if I think you already know. I'll be that annoying friend who texts you about every single thing because I never want you to feel like this again.

Character 1: That sounds exhausting.

279 Character 2: No but I'm serious! I really—I hate that I made you feel left out. That's like, literally one of the worst feelings and I should've—I should've been a better friend. I'm sorry. Really, genuinely sorry.

Character 1: I just don't get why you couldn't send one text.

280 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right. It would've taken me like two seconds and I just—I overthought it, I guess? Made it this huge deal in my head when it didn't need to be. Classic me, making everything way more complicated than it needs to be. [nervous laugh]

Character 1: Next time just tell me. Even if it's awkward.

281 Character 2: I will. I promise I will. And um—there's actually this thing next weekend at Sarah's place if you wanna—sorry, see? I'm telling you! That's me being better already. Do you maybe wanna come? We could go together?

Script: 8207758d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You're forty minutes late.

282 Character 2: I know, I know, okay? The highway was literally a parking lot. There was this massive accident and they shut down two lanes—I couldn't even get off at an exit for like twenty minutes.

Character 1: You could've texted.

283 Character 2: I did text! I sent you like three messages saying I was stuck. Check your phone. [frustrated laugh] I mean, what else was I supposed to do, abandon my car?

Character 1: My phone died. You knew we had reservations.

284 Character 2: Okay, but how is that—look, I'm sorry about the reservation, but you're acting like I planned this. I left early, actually. I gave myself extra time and everything just went to hell anyway.

Character 1: It's always something with you.

285 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not fair. When was the last time I was late? Seriously, tell me. Because I'm pretty sure I'm usually the one waiting for you half the time.

Character 1: Last month. Jamie's birthday.

286 Character 2: That was fifteen minutes! And I told you ahead of time my meeting was running over. This is different—this was literally [groan] an act of God or whatever. You can check the traffic reports if you don't believe me.

Character 1: I waited. In the rain.

287 Character 2: Okay okay, I get that you're pissed, but I was sitting in traffic going insane too, y'know? Like, you think I wanted to be stuck behind some guy's bumper stickers for forty minutes? I was stressed the whole time.

Character 1: You could've left earlier than you did.

288 Character 2: I—what? I just told you I left early! I gave myself like an extra twenty minutes, which is usually plenty. But apparently everyone decided to crash their cars today, so...

Character 1: Right. Sure.

289 Character 2: Oh, so now you think I'm lying? That's—wow, okay. You know what, I'm trying to explain what happened, but if you just wanna be mad, then fine. Be mad.

Character 1: I'm not just being mad. I'm tired of this.

290 Character 2: Tired of what, exactly? Traffic? Because yeah, me too. Or tired of—look look, I said I was sorry about the reservation. But honestly? You're being kinda unreasonable about something I literally couldn't control.

Character 1: Whatever. Let's just go.

291 Character 2: No, not whatever. I drove through hell to get here and you're treating me like I—[sigh] Fine. Let's go. But this isn't fair and you know it.

Script: 0788b1ea_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Every single time. You do this every single time.

292 Character 2: Do what? What are you even—I don't know what you're talking about. We were just hanging out, having a good time, and now you're acting like I committed some crime or something.

Character 1: Rachel was telling us about her promotion.

293 Character 2: Yeah, and? I was happy for her! I literally said congrats like three times. But then everyone started talking about work stuff and I just—I dunno, I joined the conversation. That's what people do.

Character 1: You made it about your job interview. Again.

294 Character 2: Okay okay, but she asked me about it! [scoff] She literally said "how's the job search going" and I answered. Was I supposed to just... not answer? That would've been weird.

Character 1: For twenty minutes?

295 Character 2: It wasn't—come on, it wasn't twenty minutes. Maybe like five. And everyone seemed interested! They were asking questions and I was just... I mean, I thought we were having a conversation, y'know?

Character 1: Sure.

296 Character 2: Don't do that. Don't just "sure" me like I'm some kind of—look, I get that you think I talk too much sometimes, but honestly? Sometimes it feels like you're keeping score or something. [frustrated laugh] Like you're just waiting for me to mess up.

Character 1: I'm tired of this.

297 Character 2: Of what? Of me having insecurities? Of me being human? I'm sorry I'm not perfect like—okay, that's not fair, but neither is this. You're acting like I do this maliciously when really I'm just trying to connect with people.

Character 1: By making everything about you.

298 Character 2: That's—that's not what I'm doing. Or I mean, maybe sometimes it seems that way, but it's not on purpose. When I get nervous I just... I talk. And yeah, I talk about myself because that's what I know. [sigh] It's not because I think I'm so interesting.

Character 1: Then why.

299 Character 2: Because I'm scared, okay? I'm scared that if I don't say something, anything, people are gonna realize I don't actually belong there. That I'm just—I dunno, faking it or whatever. So yeah, I overcompensate. I know I do.

Character 1: And Rachel's moment?

300 Character 2: I didn't mean to steal it. I really didn't. But also like—she got her moment! Everyone congratulated her, we toasted, the whole thing. I just... after that, I thought it was okay to share too. Apparently I was wrong.

Character 1: You always think it's okay.

301 Character 2: Yeah well, you always think it's not. Maybe—maybe instead of getting all cold and angry every time, you could just... tell me? In the moment? Instead of letting me go on and then hating me for it later. That's kinda unfair too, y'know?

Script: 28d48740_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Everything sold out.

302 Character 2: Wait wait wait—everything? Like, your entire shop? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! When did this happen?

Character 1: About an hour ago. The ceramics, the scarves. All of it.

303 Character 2: I'm literally—okay, I'm getting goosebumps right now. This is huge! How are you feeling? You must be like, completely freaking out, right?

Character 1: I don't know. It's weird.

304 Character 2: Weird how? Like good weird or—actually no, I get it. It's probably super overwhelming. Did you see it happening in real time?

Character 1: Yeah. Just watched the numbers drop. Refreshed a few times to make sure it wasn't broken.

305 Character 2: [Laugh] Of course you thought it was broken! That's so—wait, how many pieces are we talking about here?

Character 1: Forty-seven.

306 Character 2: Forty—okay, um, that's basically your entire winter collection, right? Holy shit. Do you know what triggered it? Like was there a—did someone share it or something?

Character 1: Some influencer posted about the mugs yesterday. Didn't think it would do this.

307 Character 2: An influencer? Which one? Oh my god, you're gonna—you're gonna need to make so much more stuff now. [Groan] Your poor hands!

Character 1: Haven't even shipped the current orders yet.

308 Character 2: Oh no no no, that's—okay that's actually stressful. How long is that gonna take you? Do you need help? I can totally come over and like, help you pack things or whatever.

Character 1: Maybe. I need boxes. Lots of boxes.

309 Character 2: We're going to—I'm literally grabbing my keys right now. We're gonna hit up every shipping store in town, okay? This is like, this is your moment!

Character 1: It doesn't feel real yet.

310 Character 2: I mean, yeah, of course it doesn't! You just went from, what—selling a few pieces a week to boom, cleaned out? That's gotta be absolutely mind-blowing. Are you happy though? Like underneath all the—the panic?

Character 1: I think so. Yeah. Maybe.

311 Character 2: You should be! This is—honestly? This is exactly what you deserve. [Softer] You've been working so hard on this stuff, and people finally noticed. That's not luck, babe. That's just... you being amazing at what you do.

312 SCENARIO: discovering the thing they need requires batteries not included

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I finally got this thing, and now I just need to— oh. Oh, come on. [sigh] "Batteries not included." Of course. Of course they're not included.

[slightly annoyed]

I mean, why would they— why would they make it easy, right? It's like, um, it's a flashlight. It literally needs batteries to, uh, to function. That's the whole— that's the whole point of a flashlight.

[thinking out loud]

So now I need to— I need to figure out what kind of batteries. Let me just— [pause] double A? Triple A? Wait, where does it even— oh, here we go. "Requires four double A batteries."

[resigned]

Four. Four batteries. So that's, um, that's a whole pack, basically. And I think I have some somewhere, but are they— are they the right kind? And are they even, like, are they still good? 

[trailing off]

I should probably just— I should probably just go get new ones. Make sure they're fresh and everything. But that means I have to, uh, I have to go out again, and I literally just got back from—

[accepting]

You know what? Fine. Fine. I'll just— I'll add it to tomorrow's list. The flashlight can wait one more day, I guess.

Script: e53c674a | Role: Character 1 (A)

313 Character 1: [screaming] OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD! [jumping up and down] Did we both just—did that really happen? [hysterical laughter] We're getting promoted at the same time—this is insane!

Character 2: [high-pitched squeal] I can't breathe! [gasping] Senior management, baby! [louder] SENIOR MANAGEMENT! Four years of grinding, and we finally, finally made it to the big leagues together!

314 Character 1: [shaking voice] My hands won't stop trembling. [quieter] Look at them! [explosive laugh] Remember when Johnson said we'd never make it past junior level? Where's your prophecy now, Johnson?

Character 2: [mockingly deep voice] "You two lack the necessary gravitas." [cackling] Gravitas THIS, Johnson! [normal voice, breathless] We just landed the biggest promotions in company history on the same damn day!

315 Character 1: [whispered disbelief] Twenty percent raise. [gradually louder] Twenty. Percent. Raise. [shouting] I'm buying that car, taking that trip, and getting guac at Chipotle without thinking twice! This changes everything!

Character 2: [sing-song voice] Corner office vibes! [dramatic pause] Glass walls! [squealing] A parking spot with my actual name on it instead of fighting for scraps in the overflow lot!

316 Character 1: [sobbing with joy] I called my mom before coming here. [voice breaking] She started crying—happy tears—and then I started crying. [sniffling laugh] The whole bus thought I was having a breakdown!

Character 2: [frantically fast] We need champagne—no, we need ALL the champagne! [slower, deliberate] Clear the conference room. [building excitement] We're turning this place into a celebration zone whether HR likes it or not!

317 Character 1: [hushed awe] Can you imagine Monday's meeting? [gleefully] Walking in there as executives? [voice cracking] Thompson's face when he realizes we're now his equals—priceless, absolutely priceless!

Character 2: [breathlessly] Five rejected proposals, three missed promotions, two mental breakdowns in the supply closet. [triumphant yell] But look at us now! [softer, emotional] We actually survived this corporate hellscape and won!

318 Character 1: [nervous giggle] What if they made a mistake? [panicked] What if they meant to promote Jennifer and Jennifer? [relieved exhale] No, no, I have the letter right here—it's real!

Character 2: [rhythmic chanting] We did it, we did it, we did it! [sudden stop] [whispered intensity] Promise me we'll never become those soul-sucking executives we always complained about in the break room.

319 Character 1: [melodramatic gasp] Our business cards will have "Senior Vice President" on them! [giddy whisper] Embossed lettering! [normal volume] I'm framing mine, laminating it, maybe even getting it tattooed somewhere!

Character 2: [fake serious tone] As your fellow executive, I must insist— [breaking character, shrieking] I CAN'T KEEP A STRAIGHT FACE! [whooping] We're executives! Real, actual, salary-negotiating, decision-making executives!

320 Character 1: [trembling excitement] My student loans are shaking right now. [fierce determination] They know their days are numbered! [victory cry] Sallie Mae, I'm coming for you with executive-level vengeance, baby!

Character 2: [reverently] Remember our first day? [nostalgic] Sharing that terrible vending machine coffee? [explosive joy] Now we get the good stuff—the executive lounge espresso machine that costs more than my rent!

321 Character 1: [delirious laughter] I'm dizzy—actually physically dizzy from happiness! [steadying breath] Is that normal? [more laughter] Who cares, we're EXECUTIVES now—we probably have better health insurance for dizziness!

Character 2: [mock professional] Shall we adjourn to celebrate our mutual success? [snorting laugh] God, I can't wait to use corporate speak ironically! [shouting] Let's circle back on getting absolutely wasted!

322 Character 1: [emotional whisper] We said we'd do it together. [voice swelling] Through every terrible project, every weekend overtime— [crying and laughing] We actually kept that drunk promise from the holiday party!

Character 2: [building energy] This is it—this is our moment! [screaming] THE CORNER OFFICE DREAM TEAM IS OFFICIALLY IN BUSINESS! [breathless] Now let's get out of here before someone realizes they've unleashed us on upper management!

Script: b5da7fce | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [panicked] Hi, yes, this is Sarah Mitchell, wedding ID number W-2847-B. [voice breaking] I just realized we're only, um, twelve weeks out from June 15th, and I haven't even [shakily] booked the florist or sent invitations yet!

323 Customer Support: Sarah, take a deep breath, I'm Emma, your planner. Twelve weeks at the Rosewood venue on 4521 Oak Avenue is actually manageable. Let me pull up your timeline checklist—we can absolutely work through this.

Character 1: [frantically] But my mom keeps saying that, that her friend's daughter sent invitations sixteen weeks before, and [groans] the caterer needs final numbers by May 1st! [desperately] Should I just push everything to September?

324 Customer Support: No, no, don't postpone! Invitations can go out this week if we expedite with code RUSH24 for printing. I have three florists on standby who can meet you tomorrow at 2 PM, 3:30, or 5 PM.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Tomorrow? [gasps] I have my dress fitting at Bella's Boutique at 1:30, then my fiancé needs me at the bank by 4 for the loan paperwork. [frustrated sigh] Can't we just do everything virtually?

325 Customer Support: Virtual consultations are perfect actually! The florists can do video calls—let's schedule for 7 PM your time instead? Meanwhile, I'll email you the invitation templates, just need to confirm your guest count is still 175?

Character 1: [hesitant] Well, it was 175, but now Michael's family added, um, twelve more cousins from Portland. [more anxiously] Plus my boss wants to bring her husband, so that's [sighs heavily] maybe 190 people now?

326 Customer Support: [professionally] That's fine, the Rosewood ballroom holds up to 225. [in a gentle voice] I'll adjust your catering quote with Premier Foods—their package C-190 is actually $2,000 less than package D-200. Silver lining there!

Character 1: [relieved laugh] Okay, that's... that's actually good news. [more worried] But what about the photographer? [voice rising] Jennifer Chen Photography hasn't confirmed our 10 AM start time, and her assistant keeps giving me different phone numbers—567-8901 or 567-8910?

327 Customer Support: It's 567-8901, I'll call Jennifer directly after this. [warmly] She's probably just swamped with spring bookings, but your contract #JC-1847 is locked in. Everything's actually more on track than you think, Sarah.

Script: fae24d9d | Role: Customer Support

328 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is Allied Loan Services, how can I— I see you're calling about payment posting. Let me pull up your account right away, what's your loan number?

Character 1: [frustrated] It's 4-4-7-2-9-1. [sighs heavily] Look, I made a payment ten days ago and it's still not showing. [voice breaking] I can't afford another late fee when I actually paid on time.

329 Customer Support: [rapidly] I see the account here, let me just— Yes, I show a pending payment from the 15th. [apologetically] Sometimes our system takes up to, um, fourteen business days to fully process.

Character 1: [outraged] Fourteen days?! [voice rising] My credit score is tanking because you guys can't— [exhales sharply] How is this even legal? The money left my bank account immediately!

330 Customer Support: Sir, I understand your frustration, but the processing time is clearly stated in your loan agreement. Page twelve, section four-B. Would you like me to expedite this with my supervisor?

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, page twelve, of course. [groans] Yes, please get your supervisor because this is— [desperately] I'm drowning here and you're quoting paperwork at me.

331 Customer Support: [hurriedly] Actually, wait, I'm seeing something here. Did you... did you send the payment to our old processing center? [more gently] We switched banks last month, sent out notices.

Character 1: [quietly] What notices? [increasingly panicked] I never got any— are you saying my payment went to the wrong place? [voice cracking] Where's my money then?

332 Customer Support: [speaking quickly] The payment will bounce back to your account within five to seven— I mean, it's safe, don't worry. We can waive the late fee once it's resolved.

Character 1: [bitter laugh] Once it's resolved? [exhausted] My landlord doesn't care about your processing errors. [pleading] Can't you just mark it as received since you know I paid?

333 Customer Support: I wish I could, I really do. But the system won't let me override without the actual funds. Let me create a case number for you, okay?

Character 1: [defeated] A case number. [sighs] That's your solution? [more forcefully] I've got three kids and we might lose our apartment because of your "system."

334 Customer Support: Sir, I— You know what, hold on. I'm flagging this as urgent hardship, that should escalate it within twenty-four hours instead.

Character 1: [skeptically] Twenty-four hours. [hollow laugh] You people always say that. [quietly] Last time someone promised that, it took three weeks and multiple calls.

335 Customer Support: This is different, I'm putting my employee ID on it. My direct extension is 4-5-5-1, ask for Marcus. I'll personally track this tomorrow morning.

Character 1: [surprised] You're actually— [pause] [cautiously hopeful] Marcus? [sighs] Okay, I'm writing this down. But if this doesn't work...

336 Customer Support: [confidently] It will work. Between you and me, I've seen this exact issue before. [quickly] The old bank still forwards payments, just slowly. Should hit by tomorrow afternoon.

Character 1: [wearily] I want to believe you, Marcus. [emotionally] But I've been calling you guys for two weeks and everyone says something different. [resigned] I just need this nightmare to end.

337 Customer Support: I've noted everything in your file. When you call tomorrow, even if you don't reach me, any agent will see the urgent flag. We'll get this sorted, I promise.

Character 1: [quietly] Alright. [pause] [slightly warmer] Thank you for actually listening, Marcus. [exhausted] Most agents just read scripts at me. I'll call tomorrow.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

338 [Sad] I'm so, so sorry—I know how much this meant to you and I just... [Sigh] I completely screwed up the timing, didn't I?

339 [Fast] Okay so basically my alarm didn't go off and then the train was delayed and I—I ran here from the station! [Groan]

340 [Disappointed] This is, um, this is exactly what I promised wouldn't happen. [Slow] I really let you down today, huh?

341 [Whisper] Everyone's already seated and I'm just gonna have to walk in there like—god, this is mortifying. [Tsk]

342 [Angry] I can't believe my GPS took me to the wrong—wait, no, that's not an excuse. [Sigh] I should've left earlier, I know.

343 [Happy] Well, at least I made it before the, uh, before the main part started, right? [Chuckle] That's gotta count for something!

344 [Sarcastic] Oh great, now everyone gets to watch me do the walk of shame to my seat. [Slow] This is just perfect, really.

345 [Sad] My mom's gonna be so disappointed—she reminded me like three times yesterday and I still... [Whisper] I still managed to mess it up.

346 [Shout] I'm here, I'm here! [Fast] Sorry, sorry, the parking was absolutely insane and I had to circle for like twenty minutes!

347 [Disappointed] You know what the worst part is? [Tsk] I actually woke up on time and then just, I dunno, completely lost track of everything.

348 [Fast] Is there, um, is there any way I can sneak in without—actually, never mind, I'll just own it. [Laugh]

349 [Angry] The babysitter canceled last minute and I had to—[Slow] sorry, you don't need to hear my whole sob story right now.

350 [Happy] Hey, fashionably late is still a thing, right? [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] No? Okay, yeah, I deserve that look.

351 [Whisper] I literally had nightmares about being late to this and then it actually—[Groan] it actually happened.

352 [Sad] Can we just, like, pretend I've been here the whole time? [Fast] I'll be so quiet, nobody will even notice, I promise!

353 [Disappointed] Twenty years of friendship and this is how I show up for your big day. [Sigh] I'm honestly the worst.

354 [Shout] Don't start without—oh. [Whisper] Oh, you already started. [Tsk] Of course you did.

355 [Sarcastic] Traffic was totally unpredictable, who could've known there'd be cars on the road? [Sad] God, I'm such an idiot sometimes.

356 [Fast] I've got a really good explanation but, um, but honestly? [Slow] It doesn't matter because I should've been here regardless.

357 [Happy] At least I didn't miss the—wait, I didn't miss the important part yet, did I? [Disappointed] [Groan] Please tell me I didn't.

358 SCENARIO: Complaining about a family member's criticism, then realizes they were trying to help in their own way

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my god, so my mom called me this morning and just— ugh, she just went off on me about how I'm "wasting my potential" because I mentioned I might stay at my current job another year. Like, thanks mom, really needed that with my coffee.

[annoyed]

She's like "you're too comfortable, you need to push yourself more" and I'm just— I'm twenty-six, like I think I can make my own career decisions? And she kept going on about how my cousin already got promoted twice and I'm just like, okay, cool, good for Rachel I guess.

[building frustration]

It's just so— it's exhausting, you know? Like I can't just have a conversation with her without it turning into some lecture about what I should be doing differently. I was literally just telling her about my day and somehow it became this whole thing about my life choices.
