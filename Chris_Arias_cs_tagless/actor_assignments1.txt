Script: 51ea5515 | Role: Character 2 (A)

Character 1: You were rude to Alex last night.
1 Character 2: I wasn't—okay, maybe I was a little short with them, but honestly? I'm just looking out for you. You've been together what, two months? And already they're trying to control who you hang out with?
Character 1: They're not controlling anything.
2 Character 2: Come on, seriously? They literally got upset because you wanted to have one night with your friends. That's—that's not normal, okay? And I'm supposed to just smile and pretend everything's fine?
Character 1: You didn't have to be mean about it.
3 Character 2: Mean? I barely said like five words to them all night. [Scoff] Look, I'm sorry if I wasn't super friendly, but I'm not gonna fake being best friends with someone who I think is—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.
Character 1: You're right. I don't.
4 Character 2: See, this is what I'm talking about! You used to actually listen when I had concerns about stuff. Now it's like—Alex says jump and you're already in the air. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, I'm worried about you.
Character 1: Worried. Sure.
5 Character 2: Yeah, worried! Is that so hard to believe? We've been friends for how long? And suddenly I'm the bad guy because I don't immediately love your new partner who, by the way, has been kinda sketchy about their whole situation?
Character 1: What's that supposed to mean?
6 Character 2: I mean—look look, their story keeps changing. First they were "between jobs," then they were freelancing, now they're starting a business? [Frustrated laugh] And you're paying for everything, which—fine, your money, but come on.
Character 1: Not your business.
7 Character 2: It is when you're borrowing money from me last week! I'm not—okay okay, I shouldn't have brought that up. But you gotta understand why I'm not exactly thrilled about this whole thing, right?
Character 1: So you decided to be passive-aggressive instead.
8 Character 2: I wasn't passive-aggressive, I was just... distant. There's a difference. And honestly? I thought I was being pretty restrained considering I wanted to say something way more direct about the whole situation.
Character 1: How noble of you.
9 Character 2: That's—[groan] you know what? Fine. I'm sorry I wasn't nicer to Alex. There. But I'm not sorry for being concerned, and I'm definitely not gonna pretend I like them when I don't. That's not who I am.
Character 1: Then maybe we need some space.
10 Character 2: Are you—are you serious right now? You're gonna throw away our entire friendship over someone you barely know? Because I was a little cold at dinner? I mean, if that's what you want, fine fine, but that's on you, not me.

Character 1: We need to talk about the comments.
11 Character 2: Comments? What—oh. Oh no. Is this about the thing I said at dinner? Because I was just joking around, you know? I didn't mean anything by it, honestly.
Character 1: Every time we hang out, you have something to say.
12 Character 2: That's not—okay, maybe I've made a few jokes but like, I make jokes about everything, right? That's just how I am. I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. [nervous laugh] I mean, I should've noticed, shouldn't I?
Character 1: "Must be nice to have so much free time." "Government workers barely do anything." Ring a bell?
13 Character 2: Oh god, I did say that. I—wait wait wait, but I was being sarcastic! You know I don't actually think that. I was just—everyone makes those jokes about government jobs, I didn't think—
Character 1: Right. Everyone does it. So that makes it fine.
14 Character 2: No no no, that's not what I meant. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I know those comments were stupid. Really stupid. I guess I was kinda... I dunno, maybe jealous? Of your benefits and stability and—that's not an excuse though.
Character 1: Jealous.
15 Character 2: Yeah, I mean—my job is such a mess right now and yours seems so... together? And instead of being happy for you I was being a jerk about it. Which is literally the worst way to handle it, I know.
Character 1: You could have just said that. Instead of making me feel like crap about my career.
16 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right. I should've—god, I should've just been honest instead of making those dumb passive-aggressive comments. I think I was trying to make myself feel better but obviously that's [sigh] that's so messed up. I'm really, really sorry.
Character 1: I worked hard to get this position.
17 Character 2: I know you did! That's what makes it worse—like, you studied for that exam for months, and you've been working your way up, and I just... minimized all of that. With stupid jokes that weren't even funny.
Character 1: They really weren't.
18 Character 2: They were terrible. Honestly, they were mean and I—I hate that I made you feel bad about something you should be proud of. Because you should be proud. Your job is important and you're really good at it.
Character 1: I actually do like what I do. Despite what you apparently think.
19 Character 2: No, I know—I mean, I see how passionate you are when you talk about your projects. When you're not around me being an idiot about it. [quieter] I'm gonna stop with the comments, I promise. Like, completely done. No more jokes about it.
Character 1: I just want you to respect what I do. That's all.
20 Character 2: You deserve that. You deserve so much better than how I've been acting. And I—I wanna be better. I will be better. Your friendship means everything to me and I've been such a crappy friend lately. Can we—can we maybe start over with this?

Character 1: You went ahead without me.
21 Character 2: I—okay, yeah, I did, but I tried calling you like five times. Your phone was off or dead or something, and we were gonna lose the whole opportunity if I didn't just—y'know, make the call.
Character 1: Could've waited.
22 Character 2: Could've waited? Seriously? They gave us until noon to decide, and it was already eleven-thirty. I'm not gonna [scoff] throw away something we've been working on for months just because you didn't charge your phone.
Character 1: That's not the point.
23 Character 2: Then what—what is the point? Because from where I'm standing, I made the best decision I could with the time we had. And honestly? I think you would've done the exact same thing.
Character 1: We were supposed to do this together.
24 Character 2: And we were! We are! I mean—look look, I get that you're pissed, okay? But I literally had no other option. What was I supposed to do, let everything fall apart because I couldn't reach you for two hours?
Character 1: Two hours. That's all you gave me.
25 Character 2: That's all they gave us! God, you're acting like I—like I planned this or something. [frustrated laugh] I was freaking out trying to get hold of you. Ask Jamie, ask anyone who was there.
Character 1: Did you even try to negotiate for more time?
26 Character 2: Of course I—yes, okay? Yes. They said noon, final offer, take it or leave it. And I'm sorry, but I wasn't gonna leave it. Not after everything we put into this.
Character 1: Everything we put in. Not just you.
27 Character 2: That's not—I never said it was just me. Come on, don't twist my words. You know that's not what I meant. But somebody had to make the decision, and you weren't there.
Character 1: Because my mom was in the hospital.
28 Character 2: What? I didn't—[pause] you didn't tell me that. How was I supposed to know that? All I knew was that you weren't answering, and I had like twenty minutes to decide our entire future.
Character 1: Right. Our future. That you decided alone.
29 Character 2: Okay okay, fine. You wanna be mad, be mad. But I'm not gonna apologize for doing what I thought was right. Maybe—maybe I should've waited, I dunno, but in the moment? I did what made sense.
Character 1: Guess we have different ideas about what makes sense.
30 Character 2: Yeah. [quieter] I guess we do. Look, I'm—I'm sorry about your mom, I really am. But you can't blame me for not knowing something you didn't tell me.

Character 1: You said you'd help me move.
31 Character 2: I know, I know! I'm so sorry, I just—something came up and I couldn't—okay that sounds terrible. Let me explain, please?
Character 1: Something came up. Right.
32 Character 2: No no no, listen, it's not like that! My mom called and she needed me to drive her to the hospital—wait, that makes it sound worse than it was. She's fine! But her car broke down and she had an appointment and I just... I completely blanked on the moving thing. [nervous laugh] I should've texted you.
Character 1: You should've texted me.
33 Character 2: I know. God, I know, okay? I literally feel like the worst friend ever right now. You were counting on me and I just—I totally bailed. That's not... that's not who I wanna be, y'know?
Character 1: I had to do it all myself. Four flights of stairs.
34 Character 2: Oh my god. Four flights? Jesus, I'm—I'm such an asshole. [groan] You must've been exhausted. I mean, I can't even imagine... actually wait, did you at least get someone else to help or was it really just you?
Character 1: Just me. Thanks for asking.
35 Character 2: Okay I deserve that. I totally deserve that. But like, honestly? I'm gonna make this up to you. Whatever you need—unpacking, organizing, I'll buy you pizza for a month, I don't care. Just... please don't hate me forever?
Character 1: I don't hate you.
36 Character 2: You sure? Because you seem pretty—I mean, you have every right to be pissed. I would be too if someone flaked on me like that.
Character 1: I'm tired. And my back hurts. And yeah, I'm pissed.
37 Character 2: Can I—would it be okay if I came over now? I could bring dinner and help you unpack? Or just... sit there while you yell at me some more. Whatever you need, honestly. [sigh] I just really wanna fix this.
Character 1: You can't "fix" my back.
38 Character 2: No, but I've got that heating pad you like? And um, those muscle relaxer things from when I threw out my shoulder? Plus I make a mean massage—wait, that's weird. I meant like, I could help with the heavy boxes that are left or whatever.
Character 1: ...You still have that heating pad?
39 Character 2: Yeah! The fancy one with like, all the settings and stuff. And I'll grab takeout from that Thai place you love—the one with the crazy spicy pad thai that basically destroys my mouth but you somehow eat like it's nothing?
Character 1: Fine. But you're paying.
40 Character 2: Obviously! Oh thank god, yes, absolutely I'm paying. And next time you move—which hopefully isn't for like, a really long time—I'm gonna be there super early with coffee and donuts and like, an actual truck. I promise. No more flaking.

41 SCENARIO: noticing their phone is at 5% battery with no charger nearby
==================================================

[muttering]
Oh, come on. Five percent? Really? I just— I just checked this like an hour ago and it was at, um, it was at like thirty something. How does it just— [sigh] how does it just disappear like that?

[slightly panicked]
Okay, so, um, charger. Where's my— where's my charger? It's not in my bag, it's not— did I leave it at work? Oh god, please don't tell me I left it at work because that means I'm gonna be, like, completely cut off for the rest of the—

[thinking out loud]
Wait, okay, let me just— let me just think about this logically. I could, um, I could ask someone? But that's so awkward, like, "hey, can I borrow your charger" and then I'm just, uh, I'm just tethered to their wall for like an hour.

[resigned]
Or I could just— I could just let it die. I mean, people survived without phones for, like, thousands of years, right? It's not gonna kill me to be unreachable for a few hours. Probably.

[second-guessing]
But what if someone needs to— what if there's an emergency or something important and I just— [groan] why didn't I charge it last night?

--- CONVERSATION ---
Script: 1fc8fa85 | Role: Character 1 (A)

42 Character 1: [breathless] Oh my god, is that really you? [getting louder] I can't believe it's been three months! [nervous laugh] You look exactly the same, maybe even better—have you been working out or something?
Character 2: [strained] Hi, yeah, it's me. [quieter] I'm actually in a rush right now. [clearing throat] Got a meeting downtown in twenty minutes, so I really can't stop to chat today, sorry.
43 Character 1: [pleading tone] Just five minutes, please? [faster] I've been meaning to text you but didn't know what to say. [soft whimper] I still have your sweater at my place—the blue one you loved.
Character 2: [firmly] Keep it, donate it, whatever works. [more curtly] Look, we talked about this already. [deep exhale] There's nothing left to discuss, and I really need to catch my train now.
44 Character 1: [trembling] Are you seeing someone? [accusatory] Is that why you're being so cold? [bitter laugh] I saw you tagged at that new restaurant last week—the one we always planned to try together.
Character 2: [exasperated] My personal life isn't your concern anymore. [slower pace] We broke up, remember? [sigh] You ended things, actually—said you needed space to "find yourself" or whatever that meant back then.
45 Character 1: [defensive shout] That was a mistake! [quieter now] I was confused and scared of how serious things were getting. [sniffling] Can't we just grab coffee sometime and talk like adults about everything?
Character 2: [measured tone] No, we can't. [more firmly] I've moved on with my life, and you should too. [gentle but distant] This random encounter doesn't change anything between us—we're done, completely done.
46 Character 1: [desperately] But what about our trip to Seattle? [rambling faster] The non-refundable tickets, the hotel reservations? [choking up] I know it's next month, but maybe we could still go as friends?
Character 2: [incredulous] Are you serious right now? [harsh laugh] I cancelled everything months ago, took the loss. [coldly] Going on vacation with my ex is literally the last thing I'd ever consider doing.
47 Character 1: [wounded] You act like I'm some kind of monster. [more pitifully] All I did was love you too much. [whispered] Sometimes I drive by your apartment just to feel close to you again.
Character 2: [alarmed] That's not okay—that's stalking! [voice rising] This is exactly why we can't be friends. [shakily] Please stop contacting my friends, stop showing up places, just stop everything immediately.
48 Character 1: [frantic] Your friends still like me! [defensive tone] Rachel invited me to her party last week—I'm not some pariah. [softer] Maybe if you'd actually talk to me, I wouldn't have to reach out.
Character 2: [controlled anger] Rachel was being polite. [through gritted teeth] She told me how uncomfortable you made everyone feel. [exhale] Nobody wants to pick sides, but you're forcing them into impossible positions here.
49 Character 1: [crying now] I just miss what we had. [barely audible] Every morning I wake up expecting your texts. [desperate whisper] Don't you ever think about the good times—our Sunday brunches, movie marathons?
Character 2: [softening slightly] Of course I remember. [more distant] But dwelling on the past isn't healthy for either of us. [firmly again] You need to let go and find happiness somewhere else, seriously.
50 Character 1: [angry outburst] How can you be so heartless? [accusingly] Two years together and you act like I'm nothing! [bitter] Did I really mean that little to you all along?
Character 2: [exhausted] You meant something once, yes. [slowly] But you broke that when you cheated. [sharp intake] Or did you conveniently forget that part of our story when playing the victim?
51 Character 1: [defensive shout] It was one kiss! [quieter, ashamed] One stupid, drunken mistake at a party. [pleading again] People work through worse things—my parents did, yours did too, remember?
Character 2: [with finality] We're not them. [steadily] I'm walking away now—please don't follow me. [firm whisper] If you really loved me like you claim, you'll finally respect this boundary. Goodbye.

Script: 1474026e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I hired you specifically to avoid this mess! [raising voice] The IRS is claiming I owe $47,892 in back taxes, and they're saying my 2022 return—the one YOU prepared—has major discrepancies on Schedule C.
52 Customer Support: [defensive] Mr. Harrison, I prepared your return based on the documents you provided. [more firmly] You gave me receipts totaling $23,450 in business expenses, remember? [sighs] I can't verify what you don't show me.
Character 1: [angrily] Don't you dare blame this on me! [louder] I paid you $3,500 to be the expert, to catch these things! My business address at 4521 Oak Street was listed wrong, and somehow my EIN 84-7629301 got mixed up!
53 Customer Support: [apologetically] The address error was... unfortunate, yes. [more calmly] But you wrote down 4521 Oak Avenue on your intake form, not Street. [pause] And the EIN issue—that came from your QuickBooks file you uploaded on March 15th.
Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, so now it's QuickBooks' fault? [groans] The audit letter says I claimed $18,000 in vehicle expenses without proper mileage logs. [accusingly] Didn't you tell me estimates were fine?
54 Customer Support: [firmly] I said estimates were acceptable for small amounts, not... not for half your deductions! [exasperated] The IRS Form 4549 they sent shows you claimed 42,000 business miles. [slower] Where's your documentation for that?
Character 1: [shouting] This is unbelievable! [breathing heavily] My CPA license number—sorry, YOUR CPA license 78432-B—is on every page of that return! [demanding] You're supposed to protect me from this nightmare!
55 Customer Support: [defensive tone] Mr. Harrison, being your preparer doesn't mean I can fabricate documentation. [more steadily] The audit notice CP2000 specifically questions three deposits of $15,000, $22,000, and $8,500. [carefully] You told me those were loans, but where's the paperwork?
Character 1: [desperately] They were loans from my brother-in-law! [pleading] Can't you just write them a letter explaining that? [sighs deeply] The deadline is October 23rd—that's in two weeks!
56 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I understand you're stressed, but... listen, we need actual loan agreements. [more gently] The revenue agent, Ms. Chen, badge number RA-5569, she's requesting specific documentation. [reassuring] We can still fix this if you cooperate.

57 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your account ending in 4782. [more quickly] You're currently at your credit limit of—let me see—eight thousand dollars. How can I help you today?
Character 1: [nervously] Yeah, hi, I'm... I'm actually calling because [pause] [embarrassed] I need to discuss lowering my limit. [sighs] I know I'm maxed out, but I can't keep doing this to myself.
58 Customer Support: [surprised] Oh, you want to decrease your limit? [more gently] That's actually quite responsible of you. [quickly] Most people call asking for increases, so this is refreshing to hear, honestly.
Character 1: [defensive] Well, I've been trying to get my spending under control for months. [frustrated groan] Every time I pay it down, I just—somehow—end up right back at the max. [quieter] It's like the card burns a hole in my wallet.
59 Customer Support: [professionally] I completely understand your situation. [speaking rapidly] Let me pull up the options—we can reduce it to six thousand, four thousand, or even lower if you'd prefer. [reassuring] The change would be immediate.
Character 1: [anxiously] Four thousand sounds... wait, no. [more firmly] Actually, make it three thousand. [nervous chuckle] If I'm going to do this, I need to really commit, you know?
60 Customer Support: [typing quickly] Three thousand it is—just need to confirm a few details first. [brisk tone] This is permanent until you request another change, and [pause] [carefully] any pending charges over the new limit will be declined.
Character 1: [worried] Pending charges? [panicked] Oh God, I have that automatic payment for—no wait, that's only two hundred. [relieved sigh] Okay, we're good. Please, just do it before I chicken out.
61 Customer Support: [efficiently] Processing now... and done! [cheerfully] Your new limit is three thousand dollars effective immediately. [more seriously] You'll still owe the current balance of eight thousand, of course, but no new charges above three thousand.
Character 1: [overwhelmed] Right, the eight thousand. [laughs bitterly] That's going to take forever to pay off. [determined] But at least I can't make it worse now, right?
62 Customer Support: [encouragingly] Exactly, and if you maintain your current payment schedule—let me check—[quickly] two hundred fifty monthly, you'll have significant progress within eighteen months. [helpfully] Would you like to discuss payment plan options?
Character 1: [exhausted] Maybe next month? [sighs deeply] This call was hard enough already. [gratefully] But thank you for not judging me about the whole maxed-out situation.
63 Customer Support: [warmly] There's absolutely nothing to judge—you're taking control of your finances. [speaking faster] That takes real courage, and honestly, I wish more customers would make this choice. [professionally] Is there anything else?
Character 1: [curious] Actually, yeah—can I still use the card for emergencies? [nervously] Like, if I pay some down and I'm under three thousand, it'll work normally, right?
64 Customer Support: [quickly] Absolutely, yes! [clearly] As long as you're below three thousand, the card functions normally. [reassuring] You're not closing the account, just setting a boundary for yourself.
Character 1: [relieved] Good, good. [muttering] Boundaries, that's what my therapist keeps saying I need. [louder] Who knew credit cards would be where I'd start practicing them?
65 Customer Support: [chuckles softly] Financial boundaries are actually a great place to begin! [briskly] I've noted everything in your account. [kindly] You should receive an email confirmation within the hour.
Character 1: [hopefully] Maybe in six months I'll call back and—no, wait. [catching himself] Let's not think about increases yet. [laughs] One step at a time, right?
66 Customer Support: [supportively] Exactly, one step at a time. [more firmly] Focus on that eight thousand first. [warmly] We're here if you need anything else—payment arrangements, budget tools, whatever helps.
Character 1: [sincerely] Thanks for making this easier than I expected. [sighs] Now comes the hard part—actually sticking to it. [resigned] Wish me luck, I guess.

73 [Whisper] Mom's calling me on the other line and you know how she gets when I don't pick up. [Sigh] I should probably take this.

74 Well, this has been really—I mean, honestly, it's been great catching up, but work starts super early tomorrow, so...

87 SCENARIO: Complaining about a rude driver, then admits they didn't signal either
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, you should have seen this absolute maniac on the highway today. Like this guy just— he just cuts right in front of me, no warning, nothing, just [scoff] swoops right into my lane like I don't even exist.

[annoyed]
And I'm going like seventy already, right? So I have to slam on my brakes, and my coffee goes everywhere, and this guy just keeps weaving through traffic like he's in some kind of, I don't know, Fast and Furious movie or something.

[getting worked up]
Like what is wrong with people? Use your signal! It's literally right there on your steering wheel, it's not— it's not rocket science, you know? Just give people a heads up so they don't die.

[indignant]
So I'm following behind him for like ten minutes, just watching him pull the same crap with other cars, and I'm thinking this guy shouldn't even have a license, like—

[pause] [quieter]
Wait. Wait, hold on. When I changed lanes to get behind him... did I... 

[sheepish] [half laugh]
Oh god. I didn't signal either, did I? I was so focused on being mad at him that I just— [groan] I totally did the exact same thing to the car behind me.

[embarrassed] [small laugh]
Okay, maybe we're both idiots. Maybe I should just... invest in more coffee lids and call it even.
