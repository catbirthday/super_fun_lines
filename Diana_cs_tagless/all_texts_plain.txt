What I've been—okay, if this is about the meditation thing again, I was literally just trying to help. You've been so stressed lately and I thought maybe—
Then what? Because honestly, I feel like everything I suggest lately, you just [scoff] shut down immediately. Like I'm not allowed to care about your wellbeing or something.
Preaching? That's—wow, okay, that's what you think I'm doing? I mention something that changed my life and suddenly I'm preaching? Come on, that's not fair.
That's not—that's literally not true. We talked about your job stuff for like two hours yesterday without me mentioning anything spiritual or whatever you wanna call it.
Because it kinda is! [Frustrated laugh] I mean—look look, I'm not saying you're a negative person, but the way you approach things sometimes, it's like... you're setting yourself up to fail, y'know?
It's not—ugh, it's not "my philosophy," it's just... okay fine, maybe I do bring it up a lot. But it's because I genuinely think it could help you. Is that really so terrible?
No, you didn't. You just complain about the same problems over and over and I'm supposed to—what? Just nod and pretend I don't know something that might actually make a difference?
That's called enabling, actually. And I'm sorry but—no, you know what? I'm not even that sorry. [Sigh] Friends are supposed to push each other to be better, not just... sit there and watch each other struggle.
I'm not deciding anything! I'm offering—suggesting—things that worked for me. And yeah, okay okay, maybe I get a little too enthusiastic about it sometimes, but it's coming from a good place.
Well that's—that really sucks to hear, honestly. Because everything I do, even the annoying stuff apparently, it's because I care about you. But fine, I'll just... keep my suggestions to myself from now on, I guess.
My phone? What about—oh. Oh no. Is this about dinner last night? Because I can explain, I swear, it was just—my mom was texting me about my grandma and I thought it might be important.
That's not—okay wait, that's kinda true. [nervous laugh] But it's not on purpose! I don't mean to be rude, I just—sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it, y'know?
I know, I know, that was—god, that was really bad. I'm sorry. It's just this group chat wouldn't stop going off and I kept thinking it might be about work stuff, but that's not an excuse.
What? Yes! Of course I do! Why would you even—oh. Oh shit. That's what it looks like, doesn't it? [groan] When I'm constantly on my phone it looks like I don't wanna be there.
I'm such an idiot. I literally—I love hanging out with you, you're like my favorite person. But I've been making you feel like you're not even worth putting my phone down for. That's so messed up.
Oh my god. I did, didn't I? I remember you were talking and I was—I was nodding along but I wasn't really... Fuck. I'm the worst friend. No no, don't even argue, I really am.
Okay I deserve that too. Listen, I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better. Like actually better, not just saying it. Maybe I'll just turn my phone off when we hang out? Or put it in my bag?
I have. You're right, I have, and then I just—I dunno, I fall back into old habits. But this time I mean it because honestly? Seeing how hurt you are right now is kinda killing me. [quieter] I never wanted to make you feel like you don't matter.
I know. And I'm so, so sorry. You deserve a friend who's actually present, who listens when you talk about important stuff. Not someone who's half-paying attention while doom-scrolling or whatever.
You've got me. Right here, right now, no phone. And I'm gonna—wait, actually, watch this. [pause] There. Phone's off. Completely off. And it's staying that way for the rest of today, I promise.
Wait wait wait—what? Did you just—hold on, are you saying what I think you're saying? Oh my god, you're having twins?
I'm—okay I'm literally speechless right now which, y'know, never happens. But like... twins! That's—[Gasp] that's incredible! How are you even processing this?
No no, that's—that's totally fair. I mean, you were just getting used to the idea of one baby and now it's like, surprise! Double everything!
Are you—I mean, obviously you're freaking out, right? Like, I'd be completely losing it. In a good way! But also, y'know, terrified.
Oh babe, that's—[Laugh] okay that's actually kinda hilarious but also I totally get it. Like, read the room, lady! You're in shock!
Okay okay, but also—hear me out—they'll have each other, y'know? Like, built-in best friends? That's actually really, really special when you think about it.
Of course she did! She's gonna be—oh god, she's gonna spoil them rotten, isn't she? Like, absolutely no boundaries whatsoever. [Chuckle]
Stop it—she is not! Actually no, that tracks. That's so her. But um, seriously though, how's your partner handling all this?
A spreadsheet? Already? That's—I mean, honestly that's kinda impressive. Very on-brand for them though, gotta say.
Hey, come here—no really, come here. This is huge and scary and like, completely life-changing. But you? You're gonna be amazing at this. Both of you are.
Oh god, I know—I'm so sorry. I was gonna text you but then—okay that sounds worse. Um, basically Jake called and said everyone was meeting up and I thought it would be quick, like maybe an hour? But then—
Two hours? Oh no no no, I didn't—I had no idea it was that long. [groan] I'm such an idiot. I completely lost track of time and that's not an excuse, I know, but I swear I wasn't trying to ditch you.
That's not—okay, yeah, I can see how it looks like that. But it wasn't like "oh forget about them," it was more like... I dunno, I got caught up? Which sounds terrible when I say it out loud.
Wait wait, third? I mean—okay you're right, there was the movie thing and then... [nervous laugh] yeah. Yeah, you're right. God, I'm literally the worst friend ever, aren't I? I keep doing this and I don't even realize—
No! No, that's not—he's not more important, I promise. It's just, um, you know how when a group's doing something and you kinda get swept up? That's—that's what keeps happening. But you're right to be mad. Like, completely right.
Backup plan? You're not—oh god, is that really how I've been making you feel? [sigh] I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. You're one of my best friends and I've been treating you like... like you don't matter. Which is so messed up.
I wanna fix this. I mean—I need to fix this, right? Because I can't lose you over me being an inconsiderate jerk. Tell me what to do and I'll—actually no, that's not fair to put on you. I should figure it out myself.
I know I know, and then I don't, and that's—that's on me. Honestly? I think I just get really bad FOMO and then I hurt the people who actually matter. Like you. You matter so much and I keep proving the opposite with my actions.
And I ruined it. Again. Look, I'm gonna—no more group hangs when we have plans. Like, literally gonna put it in my calendar and everything. "Sacred friend time" or whatever. [quieter] I really don't wanna lose you over this.
I promise. And I mean it—I'm gonna show you, not just say it, y'know? Actions not words. Starting with... um, wanna get coffee tomorrow? Just us? And I'll turn my phone completely off. Like, powered down off. Would that—would that be okay?
I—what? I mentioned him like once, in passing. It's not like I was going on and on about him or anything. You're making it sound way worse than it was.
Okay okay, but that's because—look, we ran into his friend at the coffee shop, remember? And then his name came up naturally when we were talking about that concert. I'm not like, obsessing over him.
Oh come on, that's—[scoff] seriously? You're gonna be like this? I can't even mention someone I dated for two years without you getting all weird about it?
How I—what does that even mean? I talk about him the same way I talk about anyone else from my past. You're reading into things that aren't there, and honestly, it's kinda exhausting.
That's not—okay, even if it does, which I don't think it does, but even if—so what? We had history. That doesn't mean I'm still hung up on him. [frustrated laugh] You're being ridiculous right now.
Yeah, actually, you are. I mean, I broke up with him, remember? I ended it. Why would I—look look, I get that you're trying to be protective or whatever, but this is getting old.
I—that was—okay fine, yes, but his story popped up and I clicked it without thinking. It's muscle memory, not like, pining or whatever you think it is. [sigh] You do stuff like that with your exes too, don't even pretend you don't.
Pretending? Are you—wow. Okay. So now I'm lying to myself too? That's great. Really supportive friend energy you're giving off here. I dunno why I even bother trying to explain myself to you sometimes.
No, because I—[groan] because I care what you think, obviously. But you're not right about this. You're just... you're projecting or something, I dunno. Maybe you're the one who needs to deal with your stuff.
Isn't it though? Like, you've been weird about every relationship I've had since Marcus. Maybe—maybe you need to ask yourself why you're so invested in whether I'm over him or not. 'Cause honestly? This feels like it's more about you than me at this point.
[overly cheerful] So, I've been reviewing your project proposal and [pause] I have some thoughts. [speeding up] Actually, quite a few thoughts—about the formatting, the font choice, even the margin width seems a bit off, don't you think?
[condescending] Well, before we get to content, [slower] let's talk about your color choices on slide seventeen. [sharp exhale] The blue is too blue, if you know what I mean? Maybe try a softer shade?
[defensive] No need to get snippy! [louder] I'm just trying to help you succeed here. [patronizing tone] Speaking of which, did you remember to run spell check? I always find at least three errors when I look.
[dismissive laugh] Sarah's great but she misses things. [rapid-fire delivery] Also, why didn't you CC me on the Tuesday email, the Wednesday follow-up, and that Thursday check-in? [accusatory] I need to be looped in on everything, remember?
[flustered] Must be a glitch in my email then. [quickly changing subject] Anyway, back to page four—I'm thinking we need more buzzwords. [enthusiastic] Synergy, optimization, leverage! [demanding tone] Can you work those in by tomorrow morning?
[oblivious] Perfect! [sing-song voice] Oh, and one more tiny thing—I noticed you used Arial instead of Calibri on the footnotes. [tsking sound] These details matter, you know. It shows attention to excellence.
[nervous chuckle] There's that attitude again! [faster pace] Look, I stayed until nine last night reformatting your tables. [martyred tone] They were off by at least two pixels, maybe three. You're welcome, by the way.
[defensive shouting] The budget's complicated! [quieter] These things take time to perfect. [building up again] Unlike your proposal, which you slapped together in what, two weeks? [scoffing] Rush jobs always need my fixes.
[wounded tone] That rejection wasn't about quality! [scrambling words] The client just didn't understand our vision. [getting higher pitched] But fine, do it your way. Just don't blame me when this falls apart tomorrow.
[fake hurt] I detect sarcasm. [lecturing tone] You know, this kind of resistance to feedback won't help your performance review. [warning voice] Team players accept guidance gracefully, even about minor details like... everything I've mentioned.
[concerned] Oh my, are you alright? [professionally] This is Iron Fist Gym on 4425 Madison Avenue. We do have several class levels available—our beginner program starts at just $89 per month. [gently] But first, did you say you don't remember what happened?
[sympathetically] Oh dear, that must have been frightening! [more upbeat] Well, our stress-relief boxing program might be perfect for you. [warmly] We have three levels: Fundamentals at $89, Intermediate at $125, and our Advanced Fighter package at $175 monthly.
[reassuring] Fundamentals is definitely the gentlest option, perfect for your situation. [cheerfully] Equipment rental is an extra $15 monthly, but your first pair of gloves is complimentary! [curiously] Unfortunately, ID JF90887 won't transfer, but I can set you up with a new account right now.
[apologetically] We don't directly bill insurance, but we can provide receipts for HSA reimbursement. [helpfully] Many clients use their flex spending! [enthusiastically] Also, if you sign up today with promo code KNOCKOUT50, you'll get 50% off your first month, making it just $52 initially.
[laughing gently] I see the irony! [professionally] Monday 6 AM is perfect—that's instructor Jake's class in Studio B. [warmly] Just bring your doctor's clearance to reception, and we'll get you started with student number TKO-2024-1198. [encouragingly] You're going to love it!
[cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling StreamMax support, my name is Jennifer. [quickly] How can I assist you with your viewing experience today?
[sympathetically] Oh, I completely understand how frustrating that must be. [more briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll get this sorted—can I have your email address associated with the account?
[professionally] Thank you, Mr. Johnson, I see your account here. [quickly] First thing, have you tried restarting your router? [more gently] I know it sounds basic but it resolves about seventy percent of streaming issues.
[apologetically] Right, sorry about that, just had to check. [briskly] What device are you streaming on and, um, what's your current internet speed—do you know?
[quickly] Absolutely, that's plenty of speed for our service. [thoughtfully] Let me check if there's any, uh, service interruptions in your area—what's your zip code?
[concerned] I'm not seeing any outages in Beverly Hills area. [more quickly] Can you tell me what quality setting you have selected in the app—is it on auto or manual?
[reassuringly] No, no, absolutely not, let me walk you through it. [briskly] Go to settings, then playback settings, and tell me what you see there.
[quickly] Try switching it to "Good" instead of "Best"—I know it sounds backwards but [more explanatory] sometimes the auto-detection gets confused and tries to stream 4K when your connection fluctuates.
[apologetically] It's temporary, just to test if that's the issue. [more firmly] If it works, we can troubleshoot why the higher quality isn't streaming properly—might be a DNS issue or bandwidth throttling.
[relieved] Great! Now let's fix it properly. [quickly] I'm going to send you some advanced settings to change—check your email in about two minutes, and also [more carefully] I'm crediting your account for this month.
[Happy] Oh my god, is this—wait, this is Mr. Buttons! [Laugh] I thought Mom threw him out like twenty years ago!
[Slow] You know, I used to, um, carry this thing everywhere when I was little. [Sad] [Sigh] God, where does the time even go?
[Whisper] Don't judge me, but I kinda still remember all the adventures we went on together. [Chuckle]
[Fast] Wait wait wait, this can't be the same one—look, it's even got the burn mark from when I tried to give it superpowers! [Happy]
[Disappointed] It's so much smaller than I—I mean, I guess everything seemed bigger back then, right? [Tsk]
[Angry] Why would Dad keep this in the attic all these years and not, like, tell me? [Groan] I literally asked about it last Christmas!
[Sarcastic] Oh great, now I'm gonna cry over a stuffed dinosaur like I'm five years old again. [Slow] Real mature.
[Sad] I remember when Grandma gave me this—she said it would, um, it would protect me from bad dreams. [Whisper]
[Shout] No way! [Fast] This thing's gotta be worth something now—vintage toys are like, super collectible, aren't they?
[Chuckle] My kids are gonna think I'm absolutely insane when I tell them Mommy used to talk to this thing for hours. [Happy]
[Slow] The fabric still smells like our old house, y'know? [Sigh] Like mothballs and, uh, something else I can't quite place.
[Disappointed] I thought finding this would feel more—I dunno, meaningful or whatever. [Fast] But it's just a dirty old toy.
[Angry] [Shout] This is what started that huge fight between me and Sarah in second grade!
[Whisper] Honestly, I'm kinda scared to touch it—what if it, like, falls apart or something? [Slow]
[Sarcastic] Sure, let's just unpack thirty years of childhood trauma with one moldy teddy bear. [Tsk] [Disappointed] This day keeps getting better.
[Happy] [Fast] I gotta call Mom right now—she's not gonna believe I actually found where she hid it!
[Sad] You were my best friend before I learned how to, um—before real friends were even a thing. [Slow] [Sigh]
[Laugh] Remember when I tried to give you a haircut and basically—yeah, that didn't go well, did it? [Happy]
[Groan] Ugh, the amount of times I made everyone pretend this thing could talk at dinner. [Sarcastic] [Fast] I was such a weird kid.
[Whisper] [Sad] I'm sorry I left you behind when we moved—I was just trying to be, y'know, grown up or whatever.
Oh god, oh no—what did I—wait, the cookies? The cookies had peanuts? I'm so sorry, I didn't even think to check, I just grabbed them because they looked really good and I thought—
That's not—okay, that's kinda true. [nervous laugh] But it's not that I don't care! I swear I care, I just get so caught up in the moment and then I forget to ask about ingredients and—no, that sounds terrible. I'm making it worse.
I know, I know, and that's—that's terrifying actually? Like when you put it that way, I realize how badly I keep messing this up. It's not just forgetting, it's like... it's your life, y'know?
I'm gonna—I'm gonna put it in my phone right now. Like, literally setting reminders and everything. [groan] God, I should've done this months ago. I don't know why I'm like this, my brain just doesn't—that's not an excuse though.
The pad thai with the—yeah. Yeah, I did say that. And then the birthday cake thing happened and I just... I dunno why it doesn't stick in my head. It's like I know you have allergies but then someone offers food and my brain goes completely blank.
No! No no no, that's not it at all. I care—I care so much, honestly. You're one of my best friends and I keep putting you in danger because I'm just—I'm careless, I guess? Not on purpose but that doesn't make it better.
You shouldn't have to. Like, you really shouldn't. That's on me, completely on me, and I—wait, I'm gonna write it on my hand right now too. Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. That's all of them, right? [sigh] See, the fact that I'm even asking...
And soy! Fuck, I'm—I'm the worst friend. I'm literally the worst. You've told me a hundred times and I still can't get it right. I don't blame you for being mad, I'd be furious if someone kept doing this to me.
That's—okay when you say it like that... I've been treating this like some minor thing, haven't I? Like "oops, forgot again" but it's not—it's actually serious and I've been so stupidly casual about your actual safety.
I'm gonna—I'm gonna fix this. For real this time, not just saying it. Maybe we could, um, go through a list together? Of safe restaurants and brands and stuff? So I have it all written down and I can actually be a decent friend for once?
What? No no no, that's not—okay, I know how it looked but I swear that's not what happened. I was trying to explain to everyone that it wasn't anybody's fault and then—
I was gesturing! I was just—my hands were moving while I talked, you know how I get when I'm nervous. And Mark was like "whose idea was it" and I kinda froze and I—[nervous laugh] okay yeah, my hand might've been in your direction but—
Okay fine, it was. It totally was pointing at you but I didn't mean—I wasn't trying to blame you! I was literally about to say that we all decided together but then everyone just assumed and started talking over me.
I tried! I mean—I wanted to, but then Jessica started going off about accountability and I just—I panicked. [Groan] God, I'm such a coward. I shoulda said something right then, I know.
I'm gonna fix this, okay? I'm gonna tell everyone tomorrow that it was actually—that you had nothing to do with it. I'll explain everything, I promise. I'll literally send a group text right now if you want.
No, it's not too late! People forget stuff like this, honestly. And I'll—I'll make sure they know the truth. Um, actually, wait—I already texted Mark like an hour ago trying to explain. He hasn't responded yet but—
Yeah! Yeah, as soon as I realized how bad it looked, I messaged him. And I'm gonna talk to Jessica tomorrow in person 'cause she's the one who really—she's the one spreading it around the most, y'know? [Sigh] I really didn't mean for this to happen.
I know, I—that's totally fair. I just freeze sometimes when everyone's staring at me and I can't—the words just don't come out right. But that's not an excuse, I know it's not. I really messed up and I'm so, so sorry.
I know. God, I know and I feel—I feel terrible about it. Like genuinely sick to my stomach. You're one of my best friends and I just... I let you down. I'm gonna make this right though, I swear. Whatever it takes.
I will. I promise I will. And there's gonna—wait, does this mean you're not completely done with me? 'Cause I thought—I was worried you'd never wanna talk to me again after this. [quieter] I really am sorry. Like, from the bottom of my heart.
Oh god, your jacket—okay, so, um, I definitely have it. I mean, I borrowed it last week for that thing, remember? And I was totally gonna bring it back but then—wait, actually let me check my car real quick.
No no no, I know how this looks. I'm not—I'm not trying to steal your stuff, I swear. I'm just really, really bad at remembering to return things and that's [nervous laugh] that's on me, totally on me.
The book! Right, I still have that too—god, I'm the worst. Like literally the worst friend ever. I keep meaning to gather everything up and bring it all back but then I—I dunno, I just space out completely. It's not an excuse, I know.
Oh no. Oh no no no, did you—was it for something important? [Groan] Please don't tell me it was for your date. It was for your date, wasn't it? I'm so sorry, I didn't even think about—
I feel terrible. Like, genuinely awful right now. You must think I'm doing this on purpose but I'm not—I would never. It's just that my brain is basically Swiss cheese lately and I can't keep track of anything, y'know?
You're right. You're absolutely right, it's not. I'm making excuses when I should just be—okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm driving home right now, grabbing literally everything of yours, and bringing it straight back. Today. Within the hour.
I know I know, but last time I—wait, no, see I'm doing it again. No excuses. [Sigh] I honestly don't blame you for being mad. I'd be furious with me too. Actually, I kinda am furious with myself.
You'll have it. I promise—actually, no, promises don't mean anything at this point, do they? Um, how about this: I'm gonna text you photos of everything I've gathered up before I leave my place. Like proof that I actually have it all ready.
And maybe—maybe we need like a system or something? Like I give you collateral when I borrow stuff? God, that sounds so stupid when I say it out loud but I clearly can't be trusted with the normal way of just, y'know, being a responsible adult.
Right. Yeah, of course. I'm—I'm leaving right now. Literally walking to my car as we speak. And I really am sorry. Like, deeply, truly sorry. I know I've been a crappy friend about this and you deserve better. [quieter] Way better.
Oh god, okay—so, um, this is gonna sound really bad but just let me explain the whole thing first? I was at the park taking those photos I told you about, right? And I—I swear I had it in my bag.
Wait wait wait, I didn't—well, I mean, technically yes but it's not like I was careless or anything! I literally had it zipped up in the front pocket and then when I got home it just wasn't—[groan] okay that sounds worse out loud.
I know. Oh my god, I know, I'm like—I'm literally sick about it. I've been back to the park three times already looking for it, I called the lost and found, I posted in all the local Facebook groups—
No no no, don't say that! I'm gonna—I'm gonna find it, I promise. Or I'll replace it! I mean, I know I can't actually replace it 'cause of the sentimental value and everything but I could try to find the same model? [nervous laugh] I've been checking eBay all morning.
Yes. God, yes, of course I do. That's why I feel so—that's why this is killing me, y'know? You trusted me with it and I just... I completely messed up. I'm so, so sorry.
You're—you're right. I mean, no, you were being a good friend and I—I let you down. Badly. Like, this is probably the worst thing I've ever done to you and I just... I dunno how to make it right.
I know, I know. And then I lose it in one day like an idiot. [sigh] I honestly—I can't even look at myself in the mirror right now. I keep replaying everything trying to figure out where it could've—actually, wait, did I tell you I'm gonna check the coffee shop too?
The one by the park! I stopped there after—oh my god, I totally forgot I went there! Maybe I—maybe I left it on the chair or something? I'm gonna go right now, actually. Will you—would you maybe wanna come with me?
Then I'll keep looking! Seriously, I'm not giving up on this. Even if it takes me weeks, months, whatever—I'm gonna make this right. And um, even if you never forgive me, which I'd totally understand, just... know that I'm really, truly sorry.
Really? You'll come? Oh thank god—I mean, thank you. I promise I'll—from now on, I'm never borrowing anything from anyone ever again. Literally nothing. Not even a pencil.
[defensive] I already told you, I was at Jake's house. [getting louder] We were just playing video games and lost track of time, okay? [frustrated sigh] Why do you always assume I'm lying about everything?
[panicked] Wait, she must have been confused! [speaking faster] Maybe she meant to call someone else's mom, there were other kids there too. [nervous laugh] You know how she gets mixed up sometimes with all those names.
[quieter] That's from walking past some people smoking outside. [defensive mumbling] And Sarah hugged me goodbye, she always wears too much perfume. [pleading] Mom, you're making this into something it's not, I swear to you.
[caught off-guard] I meant... a different Sarah! [stammering] From my chemistry class, you don't know her. [desperately] Look, fine, we went to this small get-together at Mark's house but nothing bad happened, I promise!
[defiant shout] Why can't you just trust me for once! [voice cracking] Everyone else's parents let them have a normal life! [resentful] You treat me like a prisoner, no wonder I have to sneak around sometimes!
[whining] Mom, please, you're being completely unreasonable! [more urgently] I need my phone for school and work tomorrow! [frustrated groan] Okay, okay, there was alcohol there but I didn't drink any, I was responsible!
[quickly defensive] No, nothing like that! [calmer] Everyone was being safe, some people stayed over, others got rides. [earnestly] Mom, I made good choices, I didn't drink or do anything stupid, isn't that what matters?
[desperate] This is so unfair! [voice breaking] I came home safe, I didn't do anything wrong except go to a party! [bitterly] You wonder why I don't tell you things? This is exactly why!
[panicking] No, please don't tell Dad! [bargaining quickly] I'll do extra chores, I'll stay home every weekend for a month! [desperately sincere] Mom, I'm sorry I lied, I just knew you'd overreact exactly like this!
[defeated mumble] You did raise me better. [remorseful] I know I messed up with the lying part. [quietly pleading] Can we please just talk about this without Dad? I'll tell you everything that happened, the whole truth.
[professionally] Absolutely, I can help clarify those warranty options for you. [cheerful] So with that model, you have the standard one-year manufacturer warranty, plus we offer our store protection plan. [reassuring] Did you purchase any extended coverage when you bought it?
[understanding tone] Let me pull up your purchase under your phone number. [focused] Can you confirm it's 555-0123? [more clearly] Ah yes, I see you enrolled in our TechShield Plus which covers accidental damage for three years, replacement guarantee, and includes annual tune-ups.
[enthusiastically] Actually yes, accidental damage from handling is included! [in a lighter tone] Your coverage code TSP-2024-11-QN65 specifically covers drops, spills, and yes—flying toy incidents. [chuckles] However, it doesn't cover intentional damage or, um, pet-related disasters beyond normal accidents.

[more seriously] Since today's November 22nd, they probably already called? [helpfully] Check for a voicemail from 555-SETUP, that's 555-73887.
[reassuring] No additional charges for rescheduling! [upbeat] Let me call them right now from extension 4421 and see what slots they have available. [thoughtfully] With Thanksgiving coming up, we should get you scheduled before the holiday rush really hits.
[confirming] Exactly right, the $538.98 covers your TechShield at $189.99, Premium Setup at $99.99, and you also got the premium HDMI cable kit. [in detail] That's model CBL-4K-10FT for $49 plus the wall mount bracket WM-65-ADJ for $199.99.
[sympathetic] I understand the sticker shock. [encouraging tone] But that mount is rated for up to 100 pounds and includes tilt and swivel features. [more enthusiastically] Plus with your TechShield plan, if the mount fails, we cover any damage to your TV—that alone could save you the full $1,299.99.
[helpful] I'll print you a consolidated summary right now! [cheerfully] Everything will be on one sheet—all your coverage dates, important phone numbers, your member ID TS-45892-K. [reassuring] I'll even highlight the key stuff with our store location at 9800 Main Street Mall.
[confident] They'll call within the hour to your number ending in 0123. [warmly] They have slots available tomorrow and Saturday between 8am and 6pm. [cheerful closing] And remember, once it's mounted, you have free calibration service for the first year—just call with code CAL-2024-FREE!
[professionally] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your recent premium notice. [quickly] Yes, I can definitely help explain the increase—let me just pull up your account here and, um, we can go through everything together.
[sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, truly. [more quickly] The increase is actually market-wide—we've seen rising repair costs, medical expenses are up thirty percent, and [pause] unfortunately these factors affect everyone's rates.
[gently] You're absolutely right, everything's more expensive now. [briskly] Let me check what discounts we can apply—are you still, um, working from home? [hopeful] We have new low-mileage options that could save you fifteen percent.
[quickly] Actually, three days qualifies you for our hybrid work discount! [more enthusiastically] Plus, if you bundle with homeowners—wait, do you have that with us? [pause] We could potentially get you back closer to your original rate.
[reassuringly] It's actually much easier than you'd think! [rapidly] We handle all the paperwork, coordinate the switch date, and—here's the thing—bundling would save you about [calculating] two hundred monthly across both policies.
[firmly] No catch, same coverage levels exactly. [more slowly] The savings come from the multi-policy discount, plus that hybrid work reduction, and [quickly] honestly, we really value long-term customers like yourself.
[confidently] No long-term contracts whatsoever! [briskly] You can adjust or cancel anytime—we keep customers by, you know, actually providing value. [chuckles lightly] Not by trapping them with contracts.
[efficiently] Absolutely, I'm preparing that right now actually. [quickly] I'll include both the standalone auto rate and the bundled option, with all applicable discounts itemized—should be in your inbox within five minutes.
[enthusiastically] Perfect timing to ask! [rapidly] We have a good student discount, defensive driving course credits, and if she's using a car with our safe-drive monitoring app, that's another [calculating] ten to fifteen percent off her portion.
[diplomatically] I understand the concern about privacy, really. [more reassuringly] The app only tracks driving behaviors—speed, braking, that sort of thing—not locations or destinations. [quickly] It's completely optional but the savings are substantial.
[Disappointed] So, um, I really gotta—I mean, my parking meter's definitely expired by now. [Fast] I should probably go check on that before I get a ticket.
[Whisper] Hey, uh, I think my phone's been vibrating for like ten minutes straight? [Nervous laugh] [Sigh] Someone's probably wondering where I am.
[Sarcastic] Wow, this is—this is fascinating, truly, but my cat's gonna starve if I don't leave right now. [Tsk]
[Happy] Oh! [Fast] You know what, I just remembered I've got that thing—the thing I told you about last week? [Chuckle] Yeah, I should really run!
[Slow] Listen, I'm gonna have to, uh... [Sigh] [Disappointed] I'm gonna have to stop you right there because I genuinely can't be late again.
[Angry] Okay, I've been trying to—look, I've said "goodbye" three times already! [Groan] I really need to go!
[Sad] I wish I could stay and hear the rest, honestly, but I'm just—I'm exhausted. [Slow] Maybe we can continue this another time?
[Fast] [Happy] Right, so basically my Uber's here and the driver's texting me like crazy, so I'm just gonna—yeah, bye!
[Whisper] Can I just—sorry, but I really have to use the bathroom. [Fast] Like, urgently. [Nervous laugh]
[Shout] MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE! [Laugh] No, I'm kidding, but seriously though, I do need to leave.
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Mhmm, yeah, absolutely riveting stuff here, but, uh, my dentist appointment was actually twenty minutes ago, so...
[Disappointed] You're not really picking up on my hints, are you? [Tsk] [Fast] I've been edging toward the door for literally five minutes now.
[Sad] I don't wanna be rude or anything, but I'm kinda—I mean, I'm getting a migraine? [Sigh] I just need to go lie down.
[Angry] [Fast] No, no, no, we're not doing the whole story again—I heard it the first time! [Groan] I'm leaving!
[Happy] Oh my god, wait—is that the time? [Laugh] [Fast] I totally forgot I'm supposed to pick up my kid from school!
[Slow] [Whisper] So, um, this is awkward, but my ex just walked in and I really can't—yeah. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Let me just, uh, let me just stop you right there—fascinating as your cousin's wedding drama is... [Sigh] [Disappointed] I've got actual work to do.
[Shout] [Happy] ANYWAY! Great talk! Gotta bounce! [Laugh] See ya!
[Slow] I'm gonna be honest with you here—I stopped listening about ten minutes ago? [Chuckle] [Sad] My brain's just completely fried today.
[Fast] [Angry] Y'know what, I'm just gonna—I'm walking away now, like literally walking away, because apparently saying "bye" doesn't work! [Groan]
I know, I—god, I know. I'm so sorry. I kept meaning to come, I swear I did, but then—okay that sounds terrible. That's not—let me start over.
No no no, please, just—just let me explain. I was gonna come that first weekend, right? But then my mom had that thing and I thought, okay, I'll go Monday. But Monday turned into Tuesday and then—[groan] I'm the worst friend ever.
I deserve that. I totally deserve that. I just—I got so caught up in my own stupid stuff, y'know? Like work was insane and I kept thinking I'd have more time later, but that's not an excuse. Nothing is.
I know. Even Jake came and he lives like three hours away. I'm—I'm literally twenty minutes from the hospital and I couldn't—god, I really messed up, didn't I? [nervous laugh] Like majorly, majorly messed up.
Oh god. Oh god, that's—I'm so sorry. I should've at least called. I wanted to but then I felt guilty for not visiting and then I felt like calling would be worse somehow? Like insulting? I dunno, that's so stupid, I'm so stupid.
I know. I mean—no, I don't know, but I can imagine and I—you shouldn't have been alone. You shouldn't have had to wonder where I was. I'm supposed to be your best friend and I just... wasn't there.
I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. There's literally nothing I can say that makes this okay, is there? I just—I wanna fix this but I don't know how. Tell me what to do. Please.
But I did care! I do care! I thought about you constantly, I just—I couldn't make myself go. [sigh] Hospitals kinda freak me out since my dad, but that's not—that's my problem, not yours. I should've sucked it up.
No, don't—don't make excuses for me. That was five years ago, I should be over it by now. And even if I'm not, even if hospitals make me wanna throw up, I should've been there. You needed me and I wasn't there.
No no no, you have every right to be cold. Every right to be furious actually. I'm just—I'm grateful you're even talking to me, honestly. And I promise, if there's ever a next time—which hopefully there won't be—but if there is, I'll be there. Day one. I promise.
It—it was good! I mean, okay, maybe not great great, but it wasn't bad either. You're acting like I completely lied to you or something.
That's not—[scoff] come on, that's not fair. I was trying to be supportive, y'know? You were so nervous about it and I didn't wanna pile on when you were already stressed.
And I gave you feedback! I told you about the slides and the—the timing thing. I just didn't mention every single little issue because honestly? I didn't think you wanted to hear it.
Okay okay, fine, but you gotta understand—you literally came to me right after, all excited, and you were like "did I do okay?" What was I supposed to say? [frustrated laugh] "Actually, no, you bombed it"?
But that's not what happened! It was—look, it was fine, it just wasn't as good as you thought it was. There's a difference between being honest and being cruel, y'know?
No you didn't—okay, maybe it was a little rough, but nobody's thinking about it as much as you are. Seriously. Everyone's forgotten about it already.
Your boss is—[sigh] okay, I didn't know they were gonna be there. If I'd known that, I would've been more... I dunno, more direct about stuff. But you made it sound like just a practice run.
You didn't not say it either! Look look, I'm sorry you're upset, I am, but I was trying to help. Maybe I didn't do it perfectly, but at least I was there, right?
And being a friend means—means sometimes protecting people from stuff they don't need to hear! You can't just expect me to be brutally honest all the time when you're clearly not ready for it.
Because I know you! And honestly? The fact that you're this upset kinda proves my point. You say you want honest feedback but then when things go wrong, you're acting like I'm the bad guy for trying to spare your feelings.
I know, I know how it looks, but I was literally—my mom was in the hospital, okay? I couldn't just drop everything and—I mean, I wanted to be there, but I physically couldn't.
That's—okay, that's not entirely fair. I was barely keeping it together myself. [Sigh] You're acting like I just decided to ignore you for fun when I was sitting in the ICU watching my mom on a ventilator.
Because I didn't wanna dump that on you while you were going through your thing! I figured—I dunno, I thought I was doing the right thing by not making it about me. Apparently that was wrong too.
I didn't disappear, I just—look look, I get that you're hurt, but come on. I was trying to handle my own crisis without making yours worse. [frustrated laugh] Can't exactly win here, can I?
You're right, okay okay, you're right about that. I should've—I mean, I could've sent something. But honestly? I wasn't thinking straight. I was just trying to survive each day, y'know?
Well I wasn't. I literally wasn't even on my phone for like three days straight. And now you're—fine, be mad, but don't act like I deliberately abandoned you when I was drowning too.
And that's—[scoff]—that's exactly the problem, isn't it? One time, ONE time I can't be there, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?
So was my mom possibly dying! Jesus. I'm sorry I couldn't be in two places at once. I'm sorry I'm not—I dunno, superhuman or whatever you apparently need me to be.
Then what? What did you mean? Because honestly, it feels like you're punishing me for having my own emergency at the wrong time, which—that's pretty messed up actually.
And I needed to make sure my mom didn't die alone. [quieter] Look, I'm—I'm sorry I wasn't there. I am. But I'm not gonna apologize for prioritizing that. I just... I can't.
I know, I know—god, I'm so sorry. I just—your mom was being so intense and I froze up, okay? I wanted to say something, I really did, but she just kept going and going and I—[nervous laugh] I completely chickened out.
That's not—okay, yeah. Yeah, she was being awful. And I should've—I mean, I literally had like ten different things I wanted to say but my brain just... shut down? You know how I get around parents.
Please don't—I mean, you're right. You're absolutely right. I failed you and I—I've been feeling sick about it since Saturday. Like genuinely nauseous thinking about how I just sat there like an idiot while she said all that stuff about your job and your choices and—ugh, I'm the worst friend ever.
I keep replaying it in my head, y'know? Like all the things I should've said. How I should've been like "actually, Mrs. Chen, that's not fair" or—or something. Anything. [groan] But no no no, I just smiled and nodded like a coward.
What? No! I don't—oh my god, I didn't even think about that. She probably—oh no. That makes it so much worse. I was just trying to be polite but that's—that's not an excuse, I know that's not an excuse.
I know how that sounds—wait, that came out wrong. I wasn't choosing her over you, I swear I wasn't. I just—I dunno, I got so uncomfortable and my default is to just... avoid conflict? Which is stupid, I know it's stupid, especially when someone's attacking my best friend right in front of me.
I know. I know it did and I—[sigh] I can't imagine how alone you must've felt. Like, your own mom going at you like that and then me just... abandoning you basically. That's what I did, right? I basically abandoned you when you needed me.
You're right. You're totally right and I—I wanna make this right somehow. I mean, I can't go back and fix it but maybe I could talk to her? Like separately? Tell her how wrong she was and how amazing you're actually doing and—okay, I'm rambling but I just really really need you to know how sorry I am.
Yes! God, yes, absolutely. I should've—that's what I should've done in the first place instead of sitting there like a deer in headlights. And honestly? I've been practicing what I'm gonna say. Like literally talking to myself in the mirror about how your choices are valid and she needs to respect them.
Really? You'd—you'd let me try? Because I swear I won't freeze up this time. I've got your back, I promise. I know I should've had it before and I completely failed but—but I'm gonna fix this. Or at least try to. You deserve that, you deserve so much better than how I acted. [quieter] I'm really, really sorry.
SCENARIO: trying to decide which line at the grocery store is fastest
[nervously] So, um, I have something to tell you. [clearing throat] Remember how I've been feeling weird lately? [whispered] I took a test this morning, and... I'm pregnant. Like, actually pregnant. Two pink lines pregnant.
[urgently] Take it! Take it right now! [pleading tone] I'll wait with you in the bathroom. [soft squeal] Can you imagine if we were pregnant together? That would be the most us thing ever to happen!
[soothing voice] Just breathe with me. [inhale] [exhale] Everything's going to be fine either way. We've been through worse, remember? Like that time we got food poisoning in Cabo and thought we were literally dying together.
[stunned silence] [barely audible] Two lines. [SHRIEK] TWO LINES! You're pregnant! We're both pregnant! At the same time! This is absolutely crazy! How did this even happen? Well, I know HOW, but like, the timing!
[giddy whisper] Wait, wait, let's just sit with this for a second. [dreamy tone] Just us two. [sniffling] Before the chaos starts, before the planning and panic. Right now it's just our little secret miracle.
[excitedly fast] Oh God, the cravings! The matching bumps! [squealing] The joint baby shower! We can do those cheesy maternity photos together! You know, the ones we always made fun of but secretly wanted to do anyway!
[overwhelmed] This is so surreal. [voice breaking] Last week we were complaining about being tired all the time. [soft laugh] Now we know why! The universe really said "plot twist" and delivered hard, didn't it?
[worried whisper] Are you scared? [rushed words] Because I'm terrified but also the happiest I've ever been. [shaky voice] It's like every emotion at once. Is this normal? Please tell me you feel it too.
[through happy tears] I love you so much. [hiccup laugh] Our kids are going to have the best aunt ever. [getting louder] Oh my God, we're going to be moms! Actual moms! With actual tiny humans depending on us!
[suddenly practical] Okay, we need a plan. [determined] Doctors appointments, vitamins, telling our families. [giggling nervously] My mom is going to absolutely lose her mind. Yours might actually faint. Should we tell them together too?
[professionally] I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with your windows. [sympathetic] Let me pull up your account—that's WX-4521-B, correct? [reassuring] I see here you had six double-pane units installed on October 15th at 1842 Maple Street.
[understanding] I completely understand your frustration, and that certainly shouldn't be happening with our EcoSeal Pro series. [helpful tone] Can you tell me which specific windows are affected? [gently] We'll need to schedule a technician to assess the installation and check the weatherstripping.
[apologetically] That sounds absolutely terrible, and I'm making detailed notes in your file right now. [more firmly] Under warranty EW-2023-7749A, you're covered for installation defects. [reassuring] Our next available appointment slot is Thursday at 2 PM, or we have Friday morning at 9:30.
[more apologetically] I know this is incredibly inconvenient, and I wish I had something sooner. [determined] Let me check for cancellations... [hopeful] Actually, if you're flexible, I can put you on our priority list with code PRI-8834 for any earlier openings.
[confidently] I'm assigning Tom Harrison, badge number TH-445, who's been with us twelve years. [reassuring tone] He specializes in weatherization issues and will bring a full diagnostic kit. [professionally] I'm also crediting your account $150 for the inconvenience—you'll see that as credit CR-20231127-B.
[firmly reassuring] Any installation errors are completely covered under your warranty, no questions asked. [helpful] Tom will document everything with photos and file report number INS-5521-TH if repairs are needed. [warmly] We stand behind our work one hundred percent, I promise you that.
[understanding] Absolutely, and that's exactly what you paid for and deserve. [organized tone] I have 555-0147 confirmed, and you'll receive a text reminder with Tom's photo ID the morning of. [sympathetically] Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this issue?
[efficiently] Of course, I'm sending that to janet.morrison@email.com right now—you should have it within five minutes. [thoroughly] It'll include case number CS-11247-DFT for your records. [helpfully] The email will also have Tom's direct line if you need to reschedule.
[seriously] I completely understand, and we value your referrals tremendously. [confidently] Tom will take care of everything on Thursday, I assure you. [warmly] We truly appreciate your patience with us during this frustrating situation, Ms. Morrison.
[professionally] Tom is always punctual, and he'll call thirty minutes before arrival as per protocol. [gratefully] Thank you for calling ClearView Windows, Ms. Morrison. [sincerely] We'll get those drafts fixed and your home comfortable again—you have my word on that.
[briskly] Good afternoon, I see you've got another appointment today—your fourth one this month. [apologetically] I know this has been, uh, frustrating, but I promise we'll get this sorted. [sighs] What seems to be happening with your service now?
[quickly] Right, I've got your service history pulled up here, and I can see the previous visits. [more calmly] The notes say they replaced your modem twice and, um, checked the lines. [determined] Today we're going to try a different approach entirely.
[sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration—three visits with no resolution is unacceptable. [speaking faster] Look, I'm actually the senior tech they send when... when things get complicated. [confidently] I've seen this pattern before with the 7 PM timing.
[quickly] The 7 PM issue usually indicates interference from, uh, neighborhood equipment kicking on—could be someone's ham radio or industrial equipment. [more enthusiastically] Previous techs probably just ran basic diagnostics. [firmly] I brought specialized equipment to track electromagnetic interference today.
[reassuringly] We can file an FCC complaint if needed, but let's first confirm that's actually the issue. [speaking rapidly] I need to check your external connection box and run some tests during that 7 PM window. [pause] [more gently] Would you be okay if I stay until then?
[warmly] Coffee sounds great, and yes, I'm staying until we solve this. [chuckles] That's the difference between a fourth visit and, well, getting it right. [determined] Let me grab my spectrum analyzer from the truck.
[casually] Fifteen years, and trust me, I've seen everything from squirrels chewing cables to—to microwave ovens taking down entire blocks. [laughs softly] Your case isn't even the weirdest this week. [briskly] But it's definitely fixable.
[honestly] Every provider has issues, but this specific problem—we can fix it today. [speaking quickly] I'm already seeing some unusual readings on my equipment here. [intrigued] Has anyone new moved into the neighborhood recently, maybe three weeks ago?
[triumphantly] Bingo! That's exactly the timeframe you mentioned. [rapidly] Amateur radio operators sometimes use amplifiers that, uh, aren't properly shielded. [confidently] I can install filters that'll block their interference completely.
[efficiently] Installing them as we speak—should take about ten minutes. [reassuringly] And I'm documenting everything so if you ever have issues again, any tech will know exactly what happened. [chuckles] No more guessing games.
[Disappointed] Wait, wait, wait—you literally just told me five minutes ago that you were at home all night. [Slow] So how exactly did Marcus see you downtown?
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, that's, uh, that's really interesting because I have the receipts right here on my phone. [Chuckle] Should we look at them together?
[Whisper] You know what? I'm gonna pretend I didn't just hear that because—[Fast] actually no, I can't, that's the third different story you've told me today.
[Angry] Are you seriously gonna stand there and—[Shout] I WAS THERE! I saw you with my own eyes!
[Happy] This is actually kinda hilarious because, um, Sarah already told me everything. [Laugh] Did you really think she wouldn't?
[Sad] I just... I don't understand why you'd even need to lie about something so small, you know? [Sigh] It's like, what else aren't you telling me?
[Fast] Okay so let me get this straight—first it was Tuesday, then it was Thursday, and now suddenly it never happened at all? [Tsk]
[Slow] That's funny because, uh, your location was on the whole time and I can literally see where you were. [Disappointed] Wanna try again?
[Sarcastic] Right, right, your phone just mysteriously died at the exact moment you were supposed to be there. [Slow] How convenient is that?
[Whisper] Stop. Just... stop talking, okay? [Sad] Every word you're saying is making this worse and we both know it.
[Angry] I'm not stupid—I mean, do you honestly think I'm that gullible? [Fast] The timestamps don't even match up!
[Chuckle] You're, like, the worst liar I've ever met in my entire life. [Happy] Seriously, your eye is literally twitching right now!
[Disappointed] So basically what you're telling me is that everyone else is lying except you? [Sarcastic] Yeah, that seems super likely.
[Shout] Don't you dare—[Angry] DON'T YOU DARE try to flip this around on me when I have proof!
[Slow] Um, you do realize that you posted about it on Instagram, right? [Tsk] Like, it's still there if you wanna check.
[Sad] I gave you so many chances to just be honest with me and you—[Sigh] God, I feel like such an idiot.
[Fast] Hold up, hold up—you couldn't have been stuck in traffic because they closed that road like three weeks ago for construction. [Disappointed] Nice try though.
[Happy] Oh my god, your face right now is just—[Laugh] [Laugh] You totally forgot about the security cameras, didn't you?
[Whisper] You know what's really messed up? [Slow] I actually would've understood if you'd just told me the truth from the beginning.
[Sarcastic] Mmm-hmm, and I suppose your identical twin was the one using your credit card at that exact location? [Groan] Just admit it already.
SCENARIO: Excited about buying something, then finds out it's sold out, then discovers it in a different color they like better
Oh—oh god, okay. Um, what about them? I mean, I know I've been kinda weird lately but I didn't think—wait, are you mad at me?
I wasn't being passive—okay no, that's not true. I was. I totally was and I'm sorry, I just—I've been in such a weird headspace lately, y'know? That's not an excuse though.
[Groan] God, hearing it back like that... yeah, that sounds terrible. I didn't—I wasn't trying to be mean, I swear. I was just feeling left out and instead of saying that like a normal person I got all... petty.
I know, I know! I should've just—I wanted to, honestly. But then I'd start typing and I'd delete it because what if I sounded needy or like, clingy? So instead I just... acted like a jerk apparently. [nervous laugh]
Oh no, I—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. The last thing I ever wanna do is hurt you. You're literally one of my favorite people and I just—I really messed this up, didn't I?
Because I'm an idiot? No but seriously, I think I was scared that—that maybe you were pulling away on purpose? And if I asked directly and you said yes, then... I dunno, it would make it real.
Yeah no, I see that now. I totally see that. I was being paranoid and reading into everything and—god, those texts were so passive aggressive. I hate that I did that. I hate being that person, y'know?
Wait wait wait, please don't—I mean, I get it, but please don't stop talking to me. [Sigh] I promise I'll work on it. Like actually work on it, not just say I will.
Because I'm gonna—okay, from now on, if I'm feeling weird about something, I'm just gonna tell you straight up. No more hints or whatever that passive aggressive crap was. Just... honest communication. I can do that.
Really? You're not—you're not still mad? Because I would totally understand if you were. I mean, I'm still kinda mad at myself honestly, so...
I mean—yeah, because it's literally the same situation. You're doing the exact same thing you did back then, and I'm just trying to—[sigh] I'm trying to help you see the pattern here.
Okay okay, but time doesn't make it irrelevant? Like, you're about to make the same mistake with Alex that you made with Jamie, and I'm supposed to just... not say anything?
It's—come on, it's basically identical. You get all intense, you ignore the red flags, then boom—you're devastated when it falls apart. I'm not trying to be mean here, I just... I dunno, I thought that's what friends do.
That's not—[frustrated laugh] wow, okay. So now I'm throwing things in your face? I'm literally just pointing out that maybe, y'know, we could learn from what happened before.
Because you keep—ugh, fine. You keep repeating the same stuff! And then when I bring it up, suddenly I'm the bad guy who can't let things go? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?
Oh, so now I'm keeping score? Look look, I get that you're upset, but I'm not like, sitting here with a list of your failures. It just—it comes up because it's relevant, y'know?
Um, yeah? Yeah it is. When you're literally about to text Alex the same desperate paragraph you sent Jamie at 2am? [scoff] I mean, how is that NOT relevant?
I didn't—no, I just remember because I was there, holding your phone, telling you not to send it. And you did anyway. And then we spent like three weeks dealing with the fallout, so yeah, I remember.
That's—seriously? I never said I was perfect. I've made plenty of mistakes, but at least when you point them out, I actually listen instead of getting all... whatever this is.
And this is me being tired of watching you crash into the same wall over and over. But fine fine, next time I'll just—[groan] I'll just shut up and let you figure it out yourself. Again.
Wait wait wait—the lead? Like, the actual lead lead? Oh my god, I knew you were auditioning but I didn't—this is huge! When did you find out?
And you're just now telling me? I'm—okay, I'm actually kinda offended but also like, totally proud of you right now. What's the play? Is it the Shakespeare one you mentioned?
You're playing Hamlet? That's—that's literally iconic. I mean, do you even realize how big this is? [Gasp] Wait, when do rehearsals start?
Six weeks? That's like—okay that's actually really soon. How are you feeling about it? Because you seem weirdly calm for someone who just landed, y'know, the role of a lifetime.
Nervous is—honestly? Nervous is totally normal. I'd be freaking out. Actually, no, I'd probably have thrown up by now [Laugh]. Have you told your parents yet?
What? No no no, you have to—I mean, they're gonna find out anyway, right? Unless you're planning to, like, perform in secret or something.
Okay, yeah, fair point. Your mom would probably invite the entire neighborhood and make those embarrassing signs. But still, this is—you worked really hard for this, y'know?
Stop. Just—stop right there. You're not gonna be terrible. You literally made me cry reading that monologue in your living room, remember? And that was just, like, practice.
Critics are just—okay, they're basically professional haters anyway [Chuckle]. But seriously, you've got this natural thing when you perform. It's like you become someone else entirely, it's actually kinda scary how good you are.
But you did. And that's—I mean, that's the whole point, right? You showed up, you were brave, and now you're gonna be amazing. I'm definitely getting front row tickets, by the way. Like, try and stop me.
Oh god, okay—I've been thinking about this all night. I know I—I know I messed up when you were trying to tell me about work and I just... I didn't handle it right.
I wasn't—I wasn't laughing AT you, I swear! It was just nervous, you know? Like when you said your boss was being passive aggressive, I thought you were making a joke and—wait wait, that's not an excuse. I'm not trying to make excuses.
No no no, that's not—[groan] I'm making this worse. Your problems aren't funny, they're not. I just... sometimes I don't know how to respond to serious stuff and I kinda default to trying to lighten the mood? Which is stupid, I know it's stupid.
I didn't mean it like—okay, I hear how that sounded now. Really dismissive. Like, really really dismissive. I think I was trying to relate? But instead I just... basically invalidated everything you were going through. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot.
I know. I—I've been thinking about that too, actually. Remember when you told me about your anxiety stuff and I said everyone gets nervous sometimes? That was—that was so shitty of me. I've been wanting to apologize for that for literally months but I didn't know how to bring it up.
Yeah. Yeah, I did. I think I'm just—I'm really bad at sitting with heavy stuff, y'know? Like my brain goes "quick, make it lighter, make it better" but that's not... that's not what you need from me. [sigh] That's not what being a good friend looks like.
I know. And I should've—I should've just shut up and listened. You were literally having such a hard time and instead of being there for you, I made it about... I dunno, my own discomfort with serious conversations? That's messed up.
I'm gonna—I wanna do better. Like, genuinely. I know I can't just say that and make it okay, but... maybe you could call me out? When I do it? Because honestly sometimes I don't even realize until way later and then I'm like lying in bed at 3am going "oh shit, I did it again."
No, you're right. You're totally right. That's—that's on me to figure out. I just meant... um, I mean... [nervous laugh] okay, I'm gonna work on it. By myself. And maybe, like, actually think before I speak for once?
Yeah, it would. But hey, I'm—I'm really sorry. Like truly, deeply sorry. You deserve a friend who takes your problems seriously, and I haven't been that person. But I want to be. If you'll... if you'll still let me try.
Wait wait wait—you mean the marathon? You actually—oh my god, you did it! How do you feel? Like physically, emotionally, spiritually, everything?
Oh no no no, of course it does! I mean, you just ran twenty-six point whatever miles, that's—[Laugh] that's literally insane. Are your legs even working right now?
Stop it, you didn't actually crawl—wait, did you? Oh my god, you're gonna be feeling this for like, what, a week? Did you at least get one of those shiny blankets?
You're still—okay that's actually adorable. So like, what was the worst part? Was it the wall everyone talks about? That whole hitting-the-wall thing at mile twenty or whatever?
Eighteen? That's—oof, that's early to hit it, right? But you kept going! You literally kept going even though your body was like, um, absolutely not. That's incredible.
Okay but—[Chuckle] honestly? Good for him. And good for you! You both finished, that's what matters. Did you cry at the end? I would've totally cried.
I knew it! See, this is why I love you—you're all tough and quiet but like, deep down you're just... you felt something big, didn't you? That's so human.
Your—wait, what? Just now? Or like during the race? That's disgusting but also kinda badass? I dunno how you runners just accept that as normal.
That's—okay I'm gonna pretend you didn't just tell me that. [Groan] But seriously though, are you proud of yourself? You should be so, so proud. Not everyone can do what you just did.
You think? No no no, none of this "I think" business. You ran a whole marathon! Your first one! That's like—that's a forever thing, y'know? Nobody can ever take that away from you.
SCENARIO: waiting for a website to load on slow wifi
[triumphant roar] The castle is OURS! [breathless] Look how our banner catches the wind atop their highest tower. [getting louder] Twenty years of fighting, and finally—FINALLY—we've brought these tyrants to their knees!
[quieter, awed] Remember when we were squires, dreaming of glory like this? [nostalgic chuckle] Now their throne room echoes with our footsteps. [voice breaking] My father would've wept to see this cursed place finally fall.
[fiercely] They died as warriors should—with honor! [softer now] Their names will be carved in stone, sung in every tavern. [rising intensity] This victory belongs to them as much as to us standing here!
[dismissive snort] Lords? Us? [incredulous] Can you imagine me in silk robes, collecting taxes? [getting faster] No, no—there are other tyrants, other walls to breach, other wrongs that need our swords, brother!
[sudden shout] Look there! [hushed amazement] The sun breaks through the storm clouds, shining on our colors. [reverent whisper] If that's not a sign from Heaven blessing our cause, then I'm a court jester's monkey.
[breathless] Did we just—? [voice cracking] Oh my god, we actually did it! [louder, triumphant] The lift, the impossible lift that broke my ribs in rehearsal—we nailed it perfectly on opening night!
[whispered awe] Six months of bruises. [more intensely] Six months of ice packs and doubt and our director screaming we'd never get it. [Shriek] Look at us now! Champions of gravity, defying every single law!
[choked up] My mother is in row five. [quieter] She watched me fail this a hundred times on video. [building excitement] Tonight she saw her daughter become art, become impossible, become everything I promised myself!
[urgent whisper] Feel my pulse—it's insane! [more loudly] Two hundred beats per minute of pure adrenaline and joy. [softening] This is why we destroy our bodies, for this singular moment of absolute transcendence.
[giddy] We should frame this costume! [in disbelief] No, bronze it! [Cackle] The exact leotard that witnessed history, still damp with triumph sweat and these beautiful tears that won't stop falling down my face!
[hoarse whisper] My ankles are screaming but my soul is singing. [more intensely] That moment of suspension, when time stopped— [Gasp] Did you feel it too? Like we bent reality itself to our will?
[rapid words] Quick, before we forget—remember every micro-second! [slower, desperate] The angle, the momentum, the exact way the air felt. [Whimper] I need to hold this feeling forever, bottle it, never let go!
[soft wonder] Three seconds that erased three years of rejection letters. [building strength] Every "you're not good enough" just got deleted. [Shriek] This lift is my answer to everyone who said I should quit!
[fierce whisper] Tomorrow every dance company will know our names. [louder, prouder] The duo who conquered the unconquerable lift on opening night. [Breaking voice] But tonight, right now, it's just ours to feel!
[exhausted joy] I love you so much right now. [more intensely] My partner, my trust-fall, my co-conspirator against gravity! [Whimper-laugh] We really did it. We really, actually, impossibly did it on opening night!
[professionally] I understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson. [apologetic] Let me pull up your account using your employee ID—can you confirm it's E-90234-B? [reassuring tone] I'll review the denial reason right away for claim DEN-447823-X.
[calmly] I see the issue here, Mr. Thompson. [hesitant] The claim shows a discrepancy between the pre-authorization amount of $1,250 and the submitted invoice for $1,380. [more carefully] Did you receive any additional services during that visit that weren't originally planned?
[apologetically] I'm reviewing the call log for HC-88912 now. [pause] [concerned] It appears there was a miscommunication about coverage limits for out-of-network providers. [more gently] Your plan, the Premium Select PPO-200, only covers 80% for that specific code when it's out-of-network.
[sympathetically] You're absolutely right to be confused. [sighs softly] Our provider directory was updated on October 10th, and unfortunately, Dr. Martinez's contract expired September 30th. [more apologetic] The system should have shown a notification, but I see there was a glitch between September 28th and October 12th.
[thoughtfully] Let me escalate this to my supervisor for a special review. [more hopefully] Given the documented system error and your reference number HC-88912, we might be able to process this as an administrative adjustment. [reassuring] Can you hold while I conference in Manager Davies from extension 4421?
[efficiently] It shouldn't take more than five minutes, Mr. Thompson. [pause] [more positively] Actually, Manager Davies just messaged me on our internal system. [pleased] She's pre-approved an override code, OVR-2024-1847, for the full amount based on the system error documentation.
[cheerfully] Yes, the full amount under override OVR-2024-1847. [confidently] You'll receive an email confirmation within 24 hours to your registered address, jthompson@email.com. [helpfully] The reimbursement check will be mailed to 782 Oak Street, Apartment 5B, within 7-10 business days.
[warmly] I'm glad we could resolve this today, Mr. Thompson. [professionally] I've also added a note to your account about the provider directory issue to prevent future problems. [helpfully] Is there anything else regarding your benefits or claims I can help you with while I have your file open?
[attentively] Let me check that claim for you. [pause] [informatively] I see you used your vision benefit in January 2024 for $450 at Pearl Vision. [explaining] Your plan allows one complete pair every 24 months, so you wouldn't be eligible again until January 2026.
[sympathetically] Unfortunately, prescription changes don't qualify for frequency overrides under plan PPO-200. [more helpfully] However, you might check if your FSA account still has funds—you show a balance of $675 that expires December 31st. [encouragingly] That could cover your out-of-pocket vision expenses.
[apologetically] Oh my goodness, I am so, so sorry about this situation. [quickly] Let me pull up your account right away—can you give me your confirmation number? [more reassuringly] We'll definitely get this sorted out for you immediately.
[briskly] I see the booking here, scheduled for 2 PM today. [concerned] There's no cancellation on our end, which means—let me check—[more quickly] yes, there was a miscommunication with the crew. [firmly] This is absolutely unacceptable.
[urgently] I completely understand your panic. [speaking faster] Here's what I can do—I'm dispatching our emergency team right now, they can be there within the hour. [more confidently] Plus, we're waiving all fees and adding a complimentary deep clean next month.
[reassuringly] I'm personally monitoring this dispatch myself. [quickly] The team leader, Marcus, will call you in exactly ten minutes to confirm. [more firmly] If they don't arrive by 4:30, we'll pay for any other service you book today.
[efficiently] Absolutely, pet stains are no problem at all. [briskly] I'm adding that note right now—bathrooms, kitchen, pet stain priority. [warmly] Marcus has fifteen years experience, and honestly, [chuckles] he's seen everything. Your house will be spotless, I promise.
[Happy] Oh wow, this is, uh, this is really something special, isn't it? [Nervous laugh] I mean, who wouldn't want to spend their whole Saturday doing this?
[Fast] No no no, I love it, seriously, it's like—it's exactly what I was hoping for! [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Absolutely perfect.
[Slow] You know what? [Sigh] This is actually... growing on me, I think.
[Whisper] I'm gonna tell everyone about this. [Chuckle] They're not gonna believe how, um, how incredible this experience has been.
[Shout] This is amazing! [Disappointed] I mean—yeah, totally my thing, you know?
[Happy] I could literally do this all day long, it's so—wait, we're doing this again next week too? [Groan] Great!
[Angry] Why would anyone not enjoy this? [Fast] It's basically the best thing ever, right?
[Sarcastic] Oh, I'm having the time of my life here. [Laugh] Can't you tell by my face?
[Sad] No, I'm excited, really, it's just that I—I guess I'm overwhelmed by how much fun this is gonna be.
[Disappointed] Sure, let's keep going for another hour. [Tsk] [Whisper] Or three.
[Happy] My friends are gonna be so jealous when they hear I got to—actually, maybe I won't tell them. [Chuckle]
[Fast] [Angry] Look, I said I liked it, okay? What more do you want from me?
[Slow] This is, um, definitely an experience I'll never forget. [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Lucky me.
[Whisper] Honestly? [Happy] Best birthday present ever—exactly what I wanted!
[Shout] Woo! [Disappointed] Let's, uh, let's definitely make this a regular thing, I guess.
[Sad] It's fine, it's fine, I mean—who needs to be doing literally anything else right now? [Tsk]
[Chuckle] You really went all out with this, didn't you? [Fast] I'm so touched that you thought of me for this particular... opportunity.
[Angry] [Slow] I don't know why you think I'm not enjoying myself—this is exactly my kind of torture—I mean, fun.
[Happy] Can we do the whole thing over again from the beginning? [Groan] [Whisper] Please say no.
[Sarcastic] Wow, and here I thought my day couldn't get any better. [Laugh] [Disappointed] You really know me so well.
SCENARIO: Offhandedly talking about a social media post they made, then checking the likes, then seeing a comment from their boss they didn't expect, spiraling into anxiety about what they posted
What? No, I was just—come on, I was joking around. You know I didn't mean it like that. Everyone was laughing about their own stuff too, it wasn't just you.
Okay okay, but you're acting like I—like I deliberately tried to humiliate you or something. [Scoff] That's not what happened and you know it. We always mess with each other like that.
I mean... did I though? You never said it was off limits. I'm supposed to just, what, read your mind about which things are okay to joke about and which aren't?
That's—wow, okay. So now I don't have common sense. Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're kinda blowing this way out of proportion here. It was literally five seconds of teasing.
Nobody's gonna remember it by next week, I promise you. You're the only one still thinking about it. And honestly? [Frustrated laugh] You've said way worse stuff about my hobbies before.
How? How is it different? Because—no seriously, explain it to me. Because from where I'm standing, it looks pretty much the same except you can dish it out but can't take it.
And I didn't—ugh, I didn't do it to hurt you either! That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was supposed to be fun, y'know? Light. Not this whole... thing.
Yeah, I'm—I'm getting that now, obviously. But like, instead of just telling me "hey that bothered me," you're giving me the silent treatment and acting like I'm some terrible friend. [Sigh] That's not really fair either.
Because you won't let me! You're so busy being mad that you're not even—fine fine, I'm sorry I teased you about your music. There. But I still think you're overreacting.
Well it's the best you're gonna get right now because honestly? I'm kinda hurt too that you think I'd ever intentionally—whatever. I need some air. We can talk when you actually wanna listen.
I know, I know, I'm sorry—but I literally couldn't. I was having a full-on panic attack in my car and I—I couldn't even text you properly because my hands were shaking so bad.
That's not—okay, that's not entirely fair. I've shown up to plenty of things. You're making it sound like I never come through for you, which is just... [scoff] that's not true.
Um, your birthday? Your—wait, no, I had to leave early. But I was there! And before that, I went to your sister's wedding, remember? Even though I was basically dying inside the whole time.
Because I was literally having trouble breathing! What do you want me to do, pass out at the reception? I'm trying here, I really am, but my anxiety isn't just—it's not something I can turn off.
And I appreciate that, I do, but honestly? I didn't ask you to. [frustrated laugh] Like, I'm already beating myself up about this stuff constantly, y'know? I don't need the guilt trip on top of it.
That's—no, come on, that's not what I meant. You know that's not what I meant. I just... I'm doing my best here, okay? I'm in therapy, I'm on meds, I'm trying trying trying to get better.
Wow. Okay. So what, you're just—you're done with me then? Because I have a mental illness that sometimes means I can't show up the way you want me to?
Yeah, well, good for you! Seriously, that's—that's great that yours is manageable enough for that. Mine isn't. [sigh] And I hate that about myself, trust me, but acting like I'm choosing this is just... it's kinda cruel, honestly.
Because I'm always hoping I can push through! I don't wanna be the friend who cancels, so I wait and wait and then suddenly I can't and—okay, yeah, maybe I should text sooner. Fine. That's valid.
Okay okay, I should. I should text sooner. But you gotta understand, I'm not flaking 'cause I don't care about you. It's literally the opposite—I care so much that the pressure makes everything worse, y'know?
Wait wait wait—are you serious? Oh my god, that's like—that's huge! How long have you been paying on that thing?
Four years of just... ugh, I can't even imagine. Do you feel, like, different? Because honestly when I paid off my student loans I literally [Laugh] cried in my car for like twenty minutes.
No no no, don't even—don't put that energy out there! You did this, okay? That's like, what, hundreds of dollars back in your pocket every month now?
Three hundred and—okay that's basically rent money! What are you gonna do with all that extra cash? Please tell me you're gonna treat yourself to something.
Of course you are. [Sigh] I mean, that's smart, that's really smart, but like... you gotta celebrate a little bit, right? This is a big deal!
Oh—oh that's perfect actually! Because now it's like, really yours, y'know? No more bank breathing down your neck about every little scratch or whatever.
Right right, but still—I dunno, there's something about actually owning it that just... it hits different. Like you could literally drive it off a cliff tomorrow and nobody could stop you. Not that you would! [Laugh] Obviously.
Okay but seriously though, this is like—this is such a grown-up milestone. I'm kinda jealous honestly. I've still got two more years on mine.
Yeah? Did you do anything special to pay it off early or just... stuck with the regular payments?
See that's—that's what I admire about you though. You just quietly get stuff done while the rest of us are out here like, making these big dramatic plans that never actually happen, y'know?
Oh my god, I know—I know I did and I'm literally the worst friend ever. I had it in my calendar, I swear I did, but then my phone died and I—that's not even a good excuse, is it?
Wait wait wait, the third—okay yeah, you're right. The dinner thing and then your promotion celebration... [groan] I'm just—I've been such a mess lately, you know? Like my head's been all over the place but that's not—that's not fair to you.
No no no, please don't say that. I mean—I get it, I totally get why you'd feel that way but like... I wanna fix this. I really, really wanna make this right because you're—you're super important to me, honestly.
Yes! God, yes, of course you are. I know it doesn't—okay I know my actions haven't been showing that lately [nervous laugh] but you are. I've just been really bad at... at following through on stuff and I hate that about myself right now.
I did. I—fuck, I did promise and I... I broke it. Again. There's no excuse that makes that okay, y'know? Like I could tell you about work being crazy or my anxiety being bad but that's—none of that matters because I let you down.
I know it was. And I should've—god, I should've been there. You worked so hard for that degree and I just... [sigh] I missed celebrating with you because I can't get my shit together. I'm so, so sorry.
You're right. It doesn't. I keep—I keep saying sorry and then doing the same thing over and over, don't I? That's like... that's basically the definition of being a shitty friend. I need to actually change, not just—not just apologize.
Would you—okay, I know I don't deserve it, but would you maybe give me one more chance? Like one actual last chance? I'm gonna put everything in multiple calendars, set alarms, I'll even—I'll text you the day before to confirm, every single time.
Because I'm—honestly? Because I'm scared of losing you. Like genuinely terrified. This conversation is making me realize how much I've been taking you for granted and I—[quieter] I can't lose you over my own stupidity. I won't let myself.
I will. I mean—no, I know that's what I always say. But I'm gonna prove it, okay? Actions, not words this time. Just... please don't give up on me yet? I know I don't deserve it but I'm—I'm gonna do better. I promise. And I know my promises don't mean much right now but... I'm gonna make them mean something again.
Wait wait wait—you WON? Like actually won won? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna crush it but—[Gasp] this is huge! Tell me everything!
Twenty THOUSAND—okay no, I'm literally gonna pass out. That's like... that's life-changing money! What was your project again? The thing with the—the AI something?
That's so—god, that's actually so important though. Like, you basically just made tech more inclusive and got paid for it? I'm honestly getting emotional right now.
Oh no no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you minimize your contribution. [Sigh] You always do this! You were literally up for like 36 hours straight coding, remember?
Coffee helped, he says. Right, okay, sure. So um, what happens now? Do you get to like—is there more to it or do they just hand you a giant check?
Are you gonna—I mean, you're gonna do it, right? This is like, this is your chance to turn it into something real! Unless you're not—sorry, I'm being pushy aren't I?
Oh. Oh shit, okay that's—that's actually a big deal. But like... when else are you gonna get an opportunity like this? [Chuckle] Sorry, I know, I know, it's complicated.
Of course they—I mean, they're parents, y'know? They worry. But honestly? You just proved you can literally create solutions that judges thought were worth twenty grand. That's gotta count for something.
Okay but like—can we at least celebrate first before you spiral into the whole practical adulting thing? Because you just WON A HACKATHON and I wanna buy you so many drinks right now!
Fine fine fine, mocktails then! Or—or ice cream? Pizza? Something! I'm not letting you just go home and pretend this didn't happen. This is literally the coolest thing ever and we're gonna—we're celebrating, okay?
SCENARIO: noticing a weird smell they can't identify
[sniffling] Oh my god, Sarah, look at them in their tiny caps! [voice breaking] Remember when we couldn't even get them to wear pants? [louder, wavering] Now they're singing the alphabet like actual humans!
[high-pitched wail] Jackson just waved at me from the stage! [quieter] He looks so proud in his construction paper diploma. [sobbing] I can't handle how grown up he thinks he is right now.
[trembling whisper] They're about to sing that rainbow song. [increasingly hysterical] The one they practiced every single morning while I made lunches. [wailing] I'll never hear them practice it again in our kitchen!
[gulping air] Did you see them holding hands walking in? [steadier] All twenty tiny humans in a perfect line. [breaking again] Like they actually learned something about following directions this year!
[whispering intensely] Mrs. Peterson is crying harder than us. [normal volume] Her twins are her last ones going through preschool. [sympathetic moan] She just mouthed "help me" from across the auditorium, poor thing.
[dramatically] Why did we want them to grow up so fast? [softer, sadder] All those wishes for them to sleep through the night, walk, talk. [anguished] Now I'd give anything for one more baby snuggle!
[monotone] Other parents are staring at us. [defensive] Judge away, stone-hearted robots! [proudly sobbing] Our babies learned to share, use scissors, and not lick everything - that deserves these tears of pure joy!
[determined] We need to pull ourselves together for pictures. [shaky] My mother-in-law will never let me forget if I look like this. [desperate laugh] Do you have any tissues that aren't completely soaked through yet?
[suddenly calm] Oh wait, they're singing the goodbye song. [building hysteria] The one where they wave their hands like butterflies. [completely broken] This is it, this is the end of preschool innocence forever!
[philosophical] Honestly, I'm proud of us for feeling this deeply. [more warmly] These kids know they're loved by moms who ugly cry at every milestone. [firm] That's better than perfect mascara any day, right?
[professionally] Good morning, let me pull up your account. [reassuring] Ah yes, I can see the property at 42 Oakwood Avenue. [concerned] You're showing a reading of 8,742 kilowatt hours for just this month, which does seem unusual.
[thoughtfully] Let me check the meter serial number—is it SM-90-K-2847? [more seriously] Sometimes these smart meters can malfunction or, well, they might be reading from a neighboring property. When did you last physically check the meter yourself?
[sympathetic] That definitely sounds like a fault. [calmly] I'm going to log this as case number TK-2024-0913 for you. [helpfully] We'll need to send an engineer out, probably within 3 to 5 working days, to investigate.
[reassuring tone] Don't worry, we'll put a hold on the payment until this is resolved. [professionally] I'm adding note reference MH-47B to freeze any direct debit attempts. [more warmly] We usually find these issues are resolved quickly once the engineer takes a look.
[cheerfully] Absolutely, you'll get a text to 07—is it 07856-234-190?—with a 2-hour window. [efficiently] The engineer's reference will be ENG-8834-QM. [politely] Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your account today, or shall we get that engineer visit sorted first?
[professionally] Good afternoon, Dr. Martinez's office, this is Rachel speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today?
[sympathetically] Oh, I understand your frustration, let me just... [briskly] pull up your file here. [pause] Can you verify your date of birth and the specialist you were referred to?
[apologetically] I see the notes here about your previous calls. [quickly] The referral was sent on the tenth, but it looks like—[hesitant] well, there might have been an insurance verification delay.
[defensively] Sir, I understand you're upset, but we process dozens of referrals daily and [more firmly] sometimes the specialist's office takes time to—[quickly] actually, let me call them right now while you're on hold.
[reassuringly] I'm going to place you on a brief hold—two minutes maximum—and [more briskly] I'll contact Dr. Chen's scheduling department directly. [firmly] We'll get this sorted today, I promise.
[pause] Actually sir, I'm looking at your file more closely here. [surprised] It shows Dr. Chen's office sent us a request for additional medical records [quickly] on the twenty-second, but we never... responded?
[apologetically] This is absolutely our error, and I'm so sorry. [more quickly] I'm marking this as urgent priority right now, and [determined] I will personally fax those records within the next ten minutes.
[professionally] Absolutely, I'll email you a confirmation with a tracking number for the referral. [quickly] Also, I'm giving you my direct extension—[clearly] two two seven—so you can reach me personally for updates.
[confidently] I'm putting a flag in our system to alert me of any incoming requests from Dr. Chen's office. [more reassuringly] Plus, I'll call them after I send the fax to [briskly] confirm receipt and get you a tentative appointment date.
[efficiently] I'll call you back within two hours with confirmation, and [quickly] Dr. Chen's office typically schedules within forty-eight hours of receiving completed referrals. [warmly] I've noted your cell number here—is that still the best way to reach you?
[Disappointed] Oh. Oh no, I—I really thought I had it this time, you know? [Sigh] This is, uh, this is embarrassing.
[Fast] Wait wait wait, so you're telling me that the whole thing was—that I completely misunderstood? [Laugh] Wow, okay, I'm an idiot.
[Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I spent three hours arguing about this and I was just—completely wrong the entire time?!
[Slow] So let me get this straight... everything I've been saying for the past, like, six months has been based on bad information? [Tsk]
[Happy] You know what? I'm actually kinda relieved to be wrong about this one! [Chuckle] That's, um, that's way better than what I thought.
[Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, just fantastic—I only told, what, literally everyone I know? [Groan] This is gonna be fun to explain.
[Whisper] I can't believe I just—in front of all those people, I said... [Sad] God, they must think I'm such a fool.
[Disappointed] Honestly? I was so sure, like absolutely certain that I—[Sigh] I guess I should've actually checked first, huh?
[Fast] No no no, that can't be—I mean, I literally have the email right here that says—oh. [Slow] Oh, I misread it completely.
[Angry] This is such—ugh, I hate being wrong about stuff like this! [Tsk] Especially when I was so confident about it.
[Happy] Well, um, at least we figured it out before the presentation tomorrow, right? [Laugh] That would've been a disaster!
[Sad] I really wanted to be right about this one, you know? It's just—it made so much sense in my head. [Sigh]
[Sarcastic] Great, so basically I've been living my entire life thinking that—wow, okay, that's not humiliating at all. [Chuckle] Perfect.
[Whisper] Could you, uh, could you maybe not tell anyone about this? [Fast] I mean, I'll fix it, I'll totally fix it, but just—yeah.
[Slow] You're absolutely sure though? Because I could've sworn that the book said—actually, you know what, doesn't matter anymore. [Disappointed] [Groan]
[Shout] How did I miss something so obvious?! [Angry] It was literally right there the whole time and I just—I completely ignored it!
[Happy] Okay so, plot twist—I'm totally wrong but honestly? [Chuckle] Kinda makes the whole thing funnier if you think about it.
[Sad] I, um, I owe you an apology then, don't I? [Slow] All those times I corrected you and I was actually the one who was—yeah. [Sigh]
[Fast] Hold on, let me just—I gotta process this for a second because my entire worldview just kinda—[Laugh] This changes literally everything!
[Disappointed] Mm-hmm, yep, there it is in black and white. [Tsk] I dunno how I managed to convince myself otherwise, but here we are.
SCENARIO: Casually talking about a sticker they put on something, then trying to remove it, then seeing it's leaving residue and damage, spiraling into sticker regret
Oh god, okay—I know how this looks, but I swear I didn't think he'd actually come? Like, I invited a bunch of people and he was just—I mean, I didn't specifically invite him, it was more of a group text situation and—
Wait wait wait, it's not—okay yes, technically it's your birthday thing but I thought—[nervous laugh] I honestly thought he wouldn't show up. He literally never comes to anything anymore.
I didn't—ugh, okay, I guess I did but it wasn't like... deliberate? You know how I am, I just kinda added everyone from the usual group and I wasn't thinking—I'm so sorry, I wasn't thinking about how that would make you feel.
No no no, that came out wrong. I mean—I was thinking, just not... properly? Like my brain was on autopilot and I—god, this sounds so stupid. [sigh] I really really messed up, didn't I?
I can uninvite him! I'll—I'll text him right now and just say something came up or—or that we had to change the plans or something. Would that help? I wanna fix this.
You're right, you're—you're totally right. That would probably make it worse, honestly. Um, what if I—okay, hear me out—what if I plan something different? Like just us and the core group, no Marcus, somewhere he definitely won't be?
No! No, that's not—ugh, I'm making this worse. [groan] I'm sorry, I'm just trying to—I dunno, make it right somehow? You have every right to be pissed at me. I'm literally the worst friend.
I know, I know I am. And I hate that about myself, y'know? Like I genuinely don't mean to be but then I do stuff like this and—I promise I'll be better. I'll actually think before I do things, especially when it comes to you and... him.
Of course you did. Of course. And I—I took that away from you and that's so unfair. You deserve to celebrate without having to worry about your ex being there. I'm really, really sorry. Like from the bottom of my heart sorry.
I get it, I totally get it. And I'll—I'll handle it, okay? I'll make sure you two don't have to interact at all. I'll literally be your human buffer the entire night if you want me to. Whatever you need.
I wasn't—okay, maybe I was a little short with them, but honestly? I'm just looking out for you. You've been together what, two months? And already they're trying to control who you hang out with?
Come on, seriously? They literally got upset because you wanted to have one night with your friends. That's—that's not normal, okay? And I'm supposed to just smile and pretend everything's fine?
Mean? I barely said like five words to them all night. [Scoff] Look, I'm sorry if I wasn't super friendly, but I'm not gonna fake being best friends with someone who I think is—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.
See, this is what I'm talking about! You used to actually listen when I had concerns about stuff. Now it's like—Alex says jump and you're already in the air. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, I'm worried about you.
Yeah, worried! Is that so hard to believe? We've been friends for how long? And suddenly I'm the bad guy because I don't immediately love your new partner who, by the way, has been kinda sketchy about their whole situation?
I mean—look look, their story keeps changing. First they were "between jobs," then they were freelancing, now they're starting a business? [Frustrated laugh] And you're paying for everything, which—fine, your money, but come on.
It is when you're borrowing money from me last week! I'm not—okay okay, I shouldn't have brought that up. But you gotta understand why I'm not exactly thrilled about this whole thing, right?
I wasn't passive-aggressive, I was just... distant. There's a difference. And honestly? I thought I was being pretty restrained considering I wanted to say something way more direct about the whole situation.
That's—[groan] you know what? Fine. I'm sorry I wasn't nicer to Alex. There. But I'm not sorry for being concerned, and I'm definitely not gonna pretend I like them when I don't. That's not who I am.
Are you—are you serious right now? You're gonna throw away our entire friendship over someone you barely know? Because I was a little cold at dinner? I mean, if that's what you want, fine fine, but that's on you, not me.
Oh god, I know—I know exactly what you're gonna say and you're right. I shouldn't have mentioned Tyler, I just—the story was so relevant and I wasn't thinking and—
Wait, third? I mean—okay yeah, you're right. Monday at coffee, Wednesday at your place, and then... [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever, aren't I? I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time.
I—that's not—okay I did but it wasn't about him, y'know? It was just funny and I thought—no, you're right. It was his story. I shouldn't have. I'm sorry, I really am.
What? No! No no no, absolutely not. I haven't talked to Tyler since you guys—I would never do that to you. I just have this stupid habit where I can't filter what comes out of my mouth [nervous laugh] and apparently that includes your ex.
I know, and you're—you're doing so well, honestly. Like, you're amazing. And here I am just... sabotaging everything because I can't shut up about—god, I'm so sorry. I genuinely don't mean to bring him up, it just happens.
That's not—no, that's ridiculous. I mean, sure, we were all friends but—okay wait, that came out wrong. What I'm trying to say is, you're my priority here, not him. Always you.
Yeah, I... I get that. [sigh] I really messed up, huh? It's like—I dunno, sometimes I forget that mentioning him actually hurts you because you seem so okay, but that's—that's not an excuse. I should know better.
Oh. Oh man, I—I didn't realize. That's... I'm making everything worse, aren't I? Every time I bring him up it's like—it's like I'm ripping off a bandaid or something. God, I'm such an idiot.
Yeah, that's—that's fair. More than fair, actually. Look, I'm gonna try harder, okay? Like, really try. Maybe you could, um, give me a signal or something if I start doing it again? Just like, kick me under the table or whatever?
Right. Yeah. Obviously that's—that's the actual solution here. No more Tyler stories, no more Tyler references, no more anything Tyler-related. I promise. And I mean it this time, I swear. You deserve so much better from me as a friend.
I—okay, yes, but you weren't answering anyone's calls for like three days and we were all freaking out. I didn't know what else to—I mean, someone had to know what was going on.
Look look, I get that you're pissed, but you literally disappeared after getting that news. What was I supposed to think? That you were just, I dunno, taking a mental health break? [Scoff] Come on.
And I—I respect that, usually, you know I do. But this wasn't some random gossip thing. Marcus was gonna drive to your apartment to check if you were even alive. I was trying to stop him from doing something worse.
That's not—ugh, you're making it sound so calculated. It wasn't like that. I was scared, okay? Like genuinely [frustrated laugh] terrified that something had happened to you. Sorry for caring, I guess.
Do what? Be honest about being worried? You're acting like I posted it on Facebook or something. It was one person—one person who was also losing his mind about you.
I know! I know it's yours, and I shouldn't have—but also, you shouldn't have just vanished without telling anyone you were okay. That's kinda messed up too, if we're being honest here.
And I—I get that, I really do. But three days? No response to like forty texts? You can't just drop a bomb like that and then disappear and expect everyone to be—to just sit there and wait patiently.
That's not what I'm saying and you know it. [Sigh] Your privacy matters, obviously, but so does—I mean, we're supposed to be friends. Friends don't let friends spiral alone.
Okay okay, fine. You're right. I messed up. But I'm not gonna apologize for being worried about you when you literally gave us every reason to think—whatever. You obviously don't wanna hear it.
Great. So we're just gonna—you're gonna stay mad forever then? Because I made one mistake while trying to make sure you didn't—you know what, forget it. I'm done defending myself for giving a shit.
Oh god, okay—I've been thinking about this all night. I know I messed up when you were telling me about the work thing and I just... I kept saying it wasn't that bad, right? That's—that's what this is about?
Wait wait wait, I didn't—okay, you're right. You're totally right. I keep doing this thing where you tell me something and I'm like "oh but at least" or whatever and I just [nervous laugh] I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time, y'know?
No no no, that's not—I mean, I said you might be reading too much into it but that's not the same as—actually, no, you're right. God. That's literally the same thing, isn't it? I'm such an idiot.
I know, I know. And instead I kept trying to like... fix it? Or make you feel better by saying it wasn't so bad? Which is so stupid because obviously that doesn't—that's not helpful at all. [Sigh] I think I thought I was helping but I was just... wasn't I?
Oh my god, no—your feelings absolutely matter. They matter so much and I'm—I'm honestly horrified that I made you feel that way. Like, you're one of my best friends and I just kept... basically telling you that you were wrong about your own feelings? That's so messed up.
I think I—okay this isn't an excuse, but maybe I was projecting? Like when I'm upset I want someone to tell me it's gonna be okay, but that's not—that's not what you need and I should've actually listened instead of just... talking over your feelings.
You did. You literally did and I just—I remember now, you said you needed me to just listen and I said "of course" and then I kept doing the exact same thing. [Groan] I'm like the worst friend ever, aren't I?
I wanna—I really wanna do better. I mean it. Maybe I could like, literally put tape over my mouth next time? Kidding, but seriously, I'm gonna try so hard to just... shut up and listen. You deserve that. You deserve someone who actually hears you.
And if I start doing it again—which I probably will because apparently I have zero self-awareness—just like, tell me to stop? Call me out immediately? I promise I won't get defensive or anything, I just... I genuinely don't realize when I'm doing it.
Thank you. For telling me, I mean. And for—for not just giving up on me entirely even though you'd have every right to. I'm really, really sorry. Like truly. I'm gonna work on this, I promise.
Oh god, okay—I know how it looked. I know. But I was trying to—I mean, I mentioned you! I said "we" like five times, I swear I did.
Wait wait wait, I—okay maybe not in that exact moment but I was gonna circle back to it! The boss just kept asking questions and I got caught up in explaining everything and—[nervous laugh] shit, I really didn't mention you at all, did I?
No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, those words came out but I didn't mean it like—ugh, I'm such an idiot. I got nervous! You know how I get when everyone's looking at me, I just start talking and talking and—
I know. I know, and honestly? I feel sick about it. Like literally haven't eaten since yesterday because my stomach is just—I wanna give it back. I'll tell them tomorrow it was your idea, all of it.
I will! I mean it—I'm gonna march in there first thing and—actually no, I'll email them right now. [groan] God, they probably think I'm some creative genius when really I just... I stole from my best friend. That's what I did, isn't it?
I'm so sorry. Like, I can't even—there's no excuse, y'know? I just... I panicked and then it snowballed and suddenly everyone was clapping and I couldn't figure out how to stop it without looking like a complete fraud.
Yeah. Yeah, I am. You're right. I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever and I don't blame you if you never wanna talk to me again but please, just... let me fix this? Please?
Three months and twelve days. I know because I—I kept track of every late night, every coffee run, every time you stayed up fixing my stupid coding errors. You did like ninety percent of the work and I just... presented it. [quieter] I presented it like it was mine.
I know. And I—I broke that, didn't I? Completely shattered it for a stupid promotion that I don't even—I don't even want it if it means losing you as a friend. Nothing's worth that.
First thing, I promise. And I'll—I'll put it in writing too, make sure there's documentation that it was your concept, your execution, your everything. I just... I'm really, really sorry. I hope you can forgive me. Eventually, I mean. Whenever you're ready. If you ever are.
SCENARIO: discovering they've been walking the wrong direction
[shaking voice] There ain't no other way, Jake. [bitter] The bank's coming tomorrow with the sheriff, and I'd rather see it burn [choking up] than watch them vultures pick apart what Pa built with his bare hands.
[harsh laugh] Remember when we thought we'd pass this place to our kids? [softer] Now look at us, holding torches like common outlaws. [determined growl] But they won't get the satisfaction of taking what's ours.
[urgently] We gotta do it now before I lose my nerve. [trembling] My hands are shaking something fierce, Jake. [more firmly] But watching them auction our home would kill what's left of my soul.
[weeping openly] God forgive us for what we're about to do. [angry shout] But those bastards left us no choice! [quieter] They took everything else—our savings, our dignity, our future.
[disbelieving] Can't believe it's really ending like this. [faster] All those years fighting weather, disease, raiders—survived everything except a banker's greed. [Hoarse whisper] This land was supposed to outlive us both.
[suddenly urgent] You hear that? [panicked] That's horses coming up the trail! [commanding] Light it now, Jake—throw the torch and let's ride before they get here!
[yelling over flames] The roof's going up! [desperate] We should go, but I can't look away. [Sobbing] Twenty years of my life turning to smoke, and I can't even look away.
[exhausted whisper] It's collapsing now, the whole frame. [more animated] Remember building that addition when Mary was born? [Ragged breath] Took us three months, and now it's gone in three minutes.
[sudden realization] Jake, we're outlaws now, you know that? [nervous laugh] Arson's a hanging offense in this county. [resigned] But I'd rather swing than live knowing they won in the end.
[growing distant] Time to ride, brother. [steadier] New Mexico, maybe California—somewhere they don't know our names. [wistful] Somewhere we can forget the sound of everything we loved turning to nothing.
[professionally] Let me pull up your account, 773-4429-B, one moment please. [surprised] Oh, that's... unusual. [clearing throat] It appears this fee was applied on October 23rd at exactly 3:33 AM, which is, well, outside our normal processing hours.
[more confused] Sir, I'm seeing these charges in our system but they're showing origin code ZX-99Q, which isn't—[hesitant]—which isn't actually in our fee schedule. [quietly] This shouldn't be possible.
[apologetically] Mr. Henderson, I need to escalate this immediately. [more firmly] These fee codes are appearing as "Department 7-Alpha" authorized, but we don't have a Department 7-Alpha. [nervous laugh] At least, not that I know of.
[very concerned] Sir, are you at 1842 Maple Street right now? [pause] Because our system shows you're simultaneously logged in from there and from coordinates that—[whispers]—that don't correspond to any known address.
[increasingly disturbed] Mr. Henderson, I'm going to—to transfer you to our specialized department. [very quietly] Please hold while I connect you to extension 0000. [long pause] They'll know what to do about the interdimensional fees.
[apologetic] I understand your frustration, sir, and I'm truly sorry about the delay. [speaking quickly] We're experiencing signal failures at the junction ahead, but our engineers are—they're working on it right now. [reassuringly] Should be resolved shortly.
[defensive] Sir, we operate thousands of services daily, and the vast majority run on time. [more firmly] Today's issue is, well, it's beyond our control—electrical equipment failed. [sighs] I can't make the trains move faster than safety allows.
[briskly] Current estimate is fifteen to twenty minutes, though I can't guarantee that timeframe. [more sympathetically] Look, I'll—I'll write you a delay certificate for your employer. [quickly] That should help explain the situation to them.
[patiently] The signal failure occurred after departure, sir—we couldn't have predicted it. [more firmly] If you'd like to file a formal complaint, there are forms at the station. [sighs quietly] But right now, I need to update other passengers.
[quickly] Sir, complaints are reviewed by management, and compensation is available for delays over thirty minutes. [more gently] I know it's frustrating—believe me, we don't enjoy this either. [tiredly] We're doing everything possible to get you moving.
[professionally] I've noted your concerns, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. [more briskly] The delay certificate will be time-stamped, which should help your case. [firmly] We are genuinely sorry about your interview situation.
[sympathetically] I wish I could, but we don't have those arrangements for individual passengers. [speaking quickly] Once we arrive, station staff might—they might be able to suggest local taxi services. [gently] That's the best I can offer.
[calmly] Sir, I understand you're upset, but taking it out on me won't solve anything. [more firmly] I'm just doing my job here, trying to help everyone through this delay. [sighs] Please, let's keep this civil.
[encouragingly] Actually, I've just received word—we should be moving in the next five minutes. [speaking quickly] Signal's been partially restored, so we'll proceed at reduced speed. [more optimistically] You might still make your interview.
[honestly] We'll do our best to make up time where safely possible, but I can't promise anything. [more gently] What I can say is—we're priority cleared through the next three stations. [reassuringly] That should help considerably.
[Happy] Look, I know it sounds kinda scary, but that's exactly why you should—I mean, when else are you gonna get this chance? [Laugh]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified the first time too, but then it was like... [Fast] everything just clicked, y'know?
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, just keep doing the same boring stuff forever—that sounds super fulfilling. [Tsk]
What if I told you that, um, literally everyone who's tried this has said it changed their perspective on—on everything, basically?
[Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I just thought you'd be more... adventurous than this, honestly.
[Shout] This is your chance to finally break out of that rut you're always complaining about! [Happy] Come on!
[Fast] Okay so here's the thing—it's only twenty minutes, it's completely safe, and if you hate it we can just—we'll leave immediately, alright?
[Sad] I really wanted us to, uh, to share this experience together, but I guess if you're not interested... [Sigh]
Remember when you made me try sushi and I was all weird about it?
[Angry] Stop making excuses—you're just, you're scared and you won't admit it! [Groan]
[Chuckle] The instructor is actually really cute, so there's that, I mean—not that it matters, but y'know...
[Slow] [Disappointed] Fine, I'll just... I'll go by myself then, I guess.
You're literally the one who said you wanted to be more spontaneous this year, right?
[Happy] Trust me, your Instagram is gonna look so good after this—wait, that came out wrong, but seriously! [Laugh]
[Sarcastic] Yeah, because sitting on your couch watching Netflix for the fifth weekend in a row is working out great for you. [Tsk]
[Whisper] I already kinda signed us both up, so... [Fast] please don't be mad but the deposit was non-refundable!
[Sad] [Sigh] It's just—I dunno, I thought you'd at least consider it before shooting it down completely.
What's the absolute worst thing that could happen—like really, actually think about it for a second?
[Angry] [Shout] Would you just stop overthinking everything for once in your life?!
[Slow] Sometimes the best things in life are the ones that, um, that terrify you a little bit first, y'know? [Chuckle]
SCENARIO: Frustrated about no parking, then a spot opening up right in front
I—okay, yeah, I did, but I was literally losing my mind trying to help you and I didn't know what else to do. You were spiraling and I just—I needed advice from someone who actually knows you.
Maybe not, but like—come on, you weren't talking to anyone else about it. You were just sitting on this huge thing and I could see it was eating you alive. I'm not saying I handled it perfectly, but I was trying to help.
That's not—[frustrated laugh] okay, that's not fair. I didn't break your trust, I was trying to figure out how to support you better. Marcus has been through the same thing with his parents, y'know? I thought maybe he'd have some perspective that I didn't.
Could I? Because every time I brought it up, you just—you shut down completely. And I get it, I do, but you can't expect me to just watch you struggle and not try to find ways to help. That's not how friendship works.
No, no, no—that's not what this is. I wasn't deciding anything for you. I was literally just asking Marcus if he had any advice on how to be there for you. Like, that's it. [sigh] I didn't give him every detail or whatever you're imagining.
Just that—that your parents were getting divorced and you were having a hard time with it. That's it. I didn't get into the messy stuff or the—y'know, the personal details you told me. I kept it super basic because I just needed to know how to help.
Okay, fine, maybe—maybe it was. But honestly? You're acting like I gossiped about you for fun or something. I was scared for you. You weren't eating, you were barely sleeping, and I didn't—I didn't know what to do.
I went to our mutual best friend who's been through the exact same thing. And yeah, okay, I should've asked you first, but you weren't exactly being reasonable about anything at that point. You were just—you were drowning and I was trying to throw you a life raft.
Right, because drowning people are always super logical about accepting help. [scoff] Look, I'm sorry I didn't handle it the way you wanted, okay? But I'm not gonna apologize for caring about you or trying to find ways to support you when you clearly needed it.
And you don't get to—to shut everyone out and then be mad when people who love you try to figure out how to be there for you anyway. That's not—I mean, come on, that's not realistic. I'm human, I make mistakes, but this wasn't me being malicious. This was me being worried about my best friend.
SCENARIO: attempting to thread a needle
[gruff] So, Tyler, your mother tells me you're still living in the city. [slower] Must be expensive with all those... [pause] [dismissively] fancy coffee shops and liberal types running around everywhere these days.
[suspicious tone] Accept you? [scoff] What's that supposed to mean? [increasingly agitated] In my day, we didn't need special acceptance groups—we just acted normal and got along fine without all this nonsense.
[sputtering] His? HIS? [louder] You're telling me you brought some man to your mother's house? [harsh whisper] What would your grandfather think if he were alive to see this disaster?
[bitterly] Don't you quote my father at me! [growling] He was from a different generation—he wouldn't understand all this [pause] [disgusted] modern confusion about what's right and what's completely backwards.
[defensively] I'm not judging, I'm just saying it's not natural! [frustrated grunt] [quieter] Look, Tyler, I worry about you—this lifestyle, it's [trailing off] difficult and people will always stare and whisper.
[uncomfortably] That was completely different! [pause] [mumbling] Maria and I, we were... [sigh] [quietly] We loved each other despite what the neighbors said about mixing cultures.
[long exhale] [reluctantly] Your boyfriend... Marcus... [hesitant] does he at least have a decent job? [grumbling] Not some artist or dancer or whatever stereotypes I'm supposed to expect here.
[surprised grunt] [defensive] Well, good for him then. [pause] [awkwardly formal] And I suppose you expect me to shake his hand at Christmas if your mother invites him to family gatherings?
[clearing throat] [stiffly] Well, don't get all emotional about it. [pause] [barely audible] Maybe I could meet him, just briefly— [quickly] but no public displays or whatever you kids do.
[perking up] Cowboys fan? [suspicious again] You're not just saying that to butter me up? [pause] [considering] I suppose someone who appreciates good football can't be [mumbled] completely terrible, even if...
[calmly] I understand you're upset, sir. [professionally] Let me pull up your account—can you confirm your service number? [sympathetically] We'll definitely look into this incident right away.
[defensively] Sir, our records show the service was completed at 7:43 AM this morning. [more firmly] Our drivers are trained professionals, and, well... [hesitant] sometimes pre-existing damage can appear worse after snow removal.
[apologetically] That won't be necessary—I mean, we can file a claim. [sighs] You'll need form DR-66 and, um, three estimates from licensed contractors. [quietly] The process usually takes 6-8 weeks.
[more sympathetically] I can escalate this to our damage department, reference number D-2024-8847. [reassuringly] However, they're... they're currently reviewing 47 other claims. [cautiously] Would a temporary credit of $50 help while we investigate?
[nervously] Mr. Thompson is, uh, in meetings until Thursday. [more confidently] But I can offer our expedited review for priority members—are you Silver level or Gold? [hopefully] Gold members get 72-hour resolution guarantees.
[professionally] I'm scheduling Supervisor Jenkins for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. [warmly] He'll assess everything and, if our driver's at fault... [trailing off] we'll make it right, I promise.
[apologetically] The system only allows four-hour blocks, unfortunately. [helpfully] But Jenkins usually texts 30 minutes ahead—make sure number ending in 7749 is correct? [optimistically] He's very thorough with his assessments.
[surprised] Multiple properties? [concerned] Oh, that's... that changes things significantly. [quickly] They'll each need to file separate claims using reference code M-PLT-2024. [nervously] This might go to corporate review.
[panicked] Sir, that's really not necessary! [pleading] Let me connect you directly to our Regional Damage Specialist—extension 5590. [reassuringly] She has authority to approve immediate repairs up to $5,000.
[relieved] I'm transferring you now, and I've noted everything in ticket RT-44526. [confidently] The specialist can authorize the full amount, and yes... [quietly] driver reassignment is definitely possible. [warmly] Thank you for your patience, Mr. Peterson.
[firmly] Mr. Johnson, I understand your concerns about the inspection report. [clears throat] However, I need you to understand that what we documented is, well, it's based on industry standards and [more defensively] visual evidence collected on-site.
[calmly] Sir, the staining patterns on the concrete indicate... [pause] Look, moisture meters don't lie. [more quickly] We recorded thirty-two percent humidity in the northeast corner, which significantly exceeds normal parameters for residential basements.
[briskly] Our equipment is calibrated monthly, sir, and yes, we noted the dehumidifier's presence. [sighs] The issue is—how do I put this—the foundation cracks behind your storage shelves are allowing moisture ingress regardless.
[quickly] The hairline fractures are documented in photos seventeen through twenty-three of your report appendix. [more patiently] They're subtle, I'll grant you that, but they're definitely structural concerns that need addressing.
[defensively] Sir, exposed junction boxes and aluminum wiring aren't minor issues—they're fire hazards. [more urgently] We're talking about safety here, not just, um, not just cosmetic problems that can be painted over.
[steadily] Building codes have evolved significantly since your last inspection, Mr. Johnson. [sighs heavily] What passed five years ago might not... [more quickly] Look, these aren't arbitrary rules we're inventing to sabotage your sale.
[briskly] We inspect what we see, not what paperwork claims. [more firmly] Those shingles show significant granular loss, curling edges, and—let me check here—three areas of active deterioration near the chimney flashing.
[apologetically] I understand this is stressful, truly. [pause] But we have liability if we miss something significant. [more quickly] Would you prefer we schedule a reinspection with you present to go through each item together?
[quickly] Actually, sir, the reinspection would be complementary given your concerns. [more reassuringly] We want you to feel confident in our findings, not... not ambushed by them on selling day.
[professionally] That's perfectly acceptable, Mr. Johnson. [briskly] How's Thursday at nine? We'll bring the thermal imaging camera too, so you can actually see the temperature differentials we're concerned about.
[Nervous] I keep thinking someone's gonna, like, tap me on the shoulder and say "Hey, we made a mistake hiring you." [Sigh]
[Whisper] Everyone in this meeting sounds so smart and I'm just—I'm literally googling terms under the table right now. [Fast] Don't look at my screen.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, they definitely meant to promote me, not the other Sarah from accounting. [Tsk] [Disappointed] This has gotta be some kind of mix-up.
[Angry] Why did I even open my mouth in there—god, I probably sounded like a complete idiot! [Groan]
[Happy] Wait, my boss actually liked my presentation? [Laugh] I mean, I stayed up all night because I thought it was garbage!
[Slow] Sometimes I just sit at my desk and wonder how long until they figure out I'm, um, basically winging it every single day.
[Sad] My colleague has like fifteen years experience and here I am, pretending I know what a pivot table even—actually, I should probably learn that. [Sigh]
[Fast] [Shout] I got the award! I got the—wait, are you sure this envelope has the right name on it?
[Whisper] [Chuckle] I've been nodding along to acronyms all week that I, uh, honestly have zero clue what they mean.
[Disappointed] They're all Ivy League and I'm just—I mean, my degree's from a state school nobody's heard of, so... [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, because clearly I'm qualified to lead this project with my extensive experience of, oh wait, literally none.
[Happy] You know what, maybe I'm not completely terrible at this job—I did fix that thing yesterday! [Laugh] [Fast] Okay, IT helped, but still!
[Angry] [Slow] I can't keep comparing myself to—ugh, Jessica started the same day and she's already running meetings.
[Sad] Do you ever feel like you're just... playing dress-up in your dad's suit, pretending to be a grown-up? [Sigh] [Whisper] Because I do.
[Shout] Stop saying I deserve this promotion! [Disappointed] I literally just learned how to use the coffee machine last week!
[Chuckle] My LinkedIn says "expert" but honestly I'm more like, um, "person who's really good at looking confident while panicking."
[Fast] [Angry] I spent three hours on that email because I kept thinking—what if they realize I don't actually know what I'm talking about?
[Slow] [Sarcastic] Oh great, another team lunch where I get to pretend I understand everyone's inside jokes about, er, whatever happened before I got here.
[Whisper] Sometimes when my boss compliments me, I kinda wanna ask "Are you sure you're talking about me?" [Tsk] [Sad] But that'd be weird, right?
[Happy] [Fast] My coworker just asked ME for advice—wait, they're asking me? [Laugh] I mean, sure, I'll totally help, but like, wow.
SCENARIO: Complaining about a leak in their car, then it's just condensation from the AC
Wait wait wait—what? The one you auditioned for like, last month? Oh my god, I thought you said it was a long shot! This is—this is huge!
Next WEEK? Okay, um, why are you being so casual about this? [Laugh] Like, you're literally gonna be in a movie! What's your role? Is it the—was it the one you wanted?
The sister! Yes! I remember you talking about her, she had that whole like, complicated backstory thing, right? With the—wait, doesn't she have all those emotional scenes?
Oh. Oh no, okay but—but they cast you, right? So obviously they think you can do it. Maybe they'll use like, fake tears or something? I dunno how that works honestly.
Are you—hold on, are you actually nervous? Because that's so normal, like completely completely normal. I'd be [Groan] terrified probably. But also excited? Are you excited at all?
Different how? Like, good different or... oh god, you're not gonna back out are you? Because this is—I mean, this is kinda what you've been working toward forever.
Okay no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You got cast for a reason, they saw like, hundreds of people probably and they picked YOU. [Softer] That means something, y'know?
Oh man, of course they—ugh, sorry, that's frustrating. But like, can you do both? The filming schedule, is it gonna conflict with work?
Three weeks of—okay yeah, that's... that's actually brutal. But also? Kinda badass that you're gonna do it anyway. Have you told anyone else yet or am I like, the first to know? [Laugh]
Wait, really? I'm—oh my god, I'm so honored. Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating this weekend, and I don't wanna hear any of your "it's not a big deal" stuff because it absolutely is.
Oh! Um, which—wait, are you talking about the one from last night? I thought it was cute! You looked so happy and I just wanted to—oh no. Oh no no no, you're mad.
I didn't—I mean, I didn't think it was that big of a deal? Like, it was just you at the party and—[nervous laugh] okay yeah, I can see your face right now and I'm realizing I really messed up.
Oh god. Oh my god, I didn't even—I wasn't thinking about that. I just, you know how I get when I post, I just kinda autopilot and tag everyone and—shit, did your boss see it?
I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. I can take it down! I'll take it down right now, hold on, let me just— [groan] Okay it's gone. It's deleted.
I know, I know, but maybe—maybe we can tell them you were on lunch? Or that it was an old photo? I mean, technically you were gonna leave work early anyway, right? That's what you told me—not that that makes it okay! I'm not saying it's okay.
Wait, your family? But I thought—oh. Oh no, was this the day you told them you were visiting your aunt? I—god, I really just ruined everything, didn't I? I'm such an idiot sometimes, I swear I don't think before I—
Okay, fine, a lot of the time. Most of the time? I just get excited and wanna share stuff and I forget that not everyone—that's not an excuse though. I should've asked you first. I always forget to ask.
You're right. You're—you're completely right and I hate that about myself, honestly. Like my mom says the same thing and usually I just brush it off but [sigh] when it hurts people I care about—when it hurts you—I just feel like garbage.
I know. Remember the group chat thing? And the—the birthday surprise I ruined? God, why do you even keep me around? I'm basically a walking disaster who can't keep her mouth shut, online or offline.
I am. I'm your friend who's gonna—who's gonna do better, I promise. Like, actually promise this time. Maybe you could, um, maybe check my posts before I hit send? Like a filter? I dunno, whatever helps. I just—I really don't wanna lose you over my stupid social media habits.
I—okay, wait, that's not exactly how it went down. I was trying to figure out if you wanted me to jump in or if that would've made things worse with your mom.
Yeah, and I didn't know what that meant! Was it like "help me" or "please don't make this worse"? You know how your family gets when outsiders—when other people get involved. [Sigh] I've seen it happen before.
That's—no, that's not fair. I tried to change the subject like three times. I literally brought up the weather, which was super awkward, but I was trying to give you an out without overstepping.
I know, I know, and that sucked to watch, honestly it did. But you're acting like I—look, last time I defended you to your dad, you told me afterwards that I made everything ten times worse, remember?
How? How was it different? Because from where I'm sitting, it's like—I can't win here. [frustrated laugh] Either I'm overstepping or I'm not doing enough, and I never know which one you want until after.
In front of your whole family? Like, "Hey, excuse me everyone, should I defend my friend right now?" Come on. That would've been—you know that would've been weird.
Okay okay, that's—I didn't abandon you. That word is kinda harsh, don't you think? I was literally sitting right there, trying to figure out how to help without making your mom go completely nuclear on both of us.
And you're mine, which is why I—ugh, this is so frustrating. I'm sorry I didn't handle it perfectly, alright? But I was genuinely trying not to make your situation worse. That's gotta count for something.
I mean... yeah? I think it should? Look look, I get that you're hurt, and maybe I should've—I dunno, done something different. [Scoff] But you're not even acknowledging that I was in an impossible position here.
And I was there! Just not—not in the exact way you wanted, apparently. But I was there, and I'm here now, even though you're basically treating me like I'm the enemy when your family's the one who—whatever. This is exhausting.
That's not—okay, that's literally not true. I don't always have to be right, I just... when I know something, I say it. There's a difference.
Seriously? You're gonna make me—fine, remember last month when we were arguing about that movie thing? I said you were right about the director. [scoff] But apparently that doesn't count now.
So what? I still admitted it, didn't I? Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here, but like... if I think something's true, I'm gonna say it. That's not me being stubborn, that's just—that's just being honest.
Okay okay, but you're acting like I do this to annoy you on purpose. I don't! I genuinely—when I say something, it's because I believe it's right. Would you rather I just... pretend to be wrong when I'm not?
That's—wow. [frustrated laugh] So you want me to lie? Just nod along and agree with everything even when I know it's not accurate? That's not who I am, y'know?
And I get that, I do, but you're making it sound like I turn everything into an argument when really I'm just—I'm trying to help. Like, if you're wrong about something, wouldn't you wanna know?
That's... that's actually really hurtful. Look look, I know I can be—intense or whatever, but I'm not doing it to make you feel stupid. That's never been the point.
Well it's not, okay? It's not. And honestly? You're kinda doing the same thing right now—deciding you're right about my intentions without even listening to what I'm saying.
How? How is it different? Because from where I'm sitting, you've already decided I'm this horrible person who has to win every argument, and nothing I say is gonna change your mind. [sigh] Which is pretty ironic if you think about it.
And I—I am your friend. Or I'm trying to be. But I can't just turn off my brain, y'know? I can't pretend not to know things. Maybe that makes me annoying, but it's also just... me.
Oh. Oh no. Wait wait wait, that wasn't—okay I know how it looked but I swear it wasn't what you think. We were just talking about the project and then—I mean, yeah, we were laughing but that's just—
I was? I—okay maybe I was but like, you know how I am, right? I'm just naturally touchy with everyone and I didn't even realize—[nervous laugh] god, I'm such an idiot. I wasn't thinking about it like that at all.
I know. I know I knew, and that's—that's the worst part. I just got caught up in the conversation and honestly, Alex was being really funny and I kinda forgot to—no, that sounds terrible. I didn't forget, I just wasn't being careful enough.
No no no, not like—I didn't mean it like that. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I absolutely was not trying to flirt with them. Like, I have zero interest in Alex that way, I promise you.
Wait, what? What do you mean? Did they—did they say something to you? Oh god, if they think I was hitting on them—okay this is bad. This is really really bad and I'm gonna fix it, I swear.
I'll talk to them! I'll—I'll make it super clear that I'm not interested and actually, y'know what? I'll tell them how amazing you are. Like casually drop it into conversation that you're—wait, is that weird? That might be weird. But I wanna help somehow.
You're right. You're totally right. I should just—I should back off completely, shouldn't I? [sigh] God, I really messed this up for you. I'm so so sorry. I never wanted to get in the way of—of whatever could happen between you two.
You were? Oh man, you still should! Honestly, you really really should because I don't think—look, from what I could tell, Alex seems pretty interested in you too. They kept asking about you actually, which I probably should've mentioned earlier but—
Yeah! Like multiple times! They wanted to know what kinda music you're into and if you were dating anyone and—oh my god, I'm literally the worst friend ever for not putting two and two together. They were totally fishing for info about you.
Because I'm an idiot? Because I was too busy being my usual chatty self to realize what was happening? I dunno, I just—[nervous laugh] I guess I was so worried about looking like I was flirting that I didn't notice they were basically interviewing me about you. Still gonna ask them out?
SCENARIO: realizing they left their loyalty card at home
[trembling voice] I keep thinking this isn't real, that tomorrow you'll still be here. [Shaky breath] We've been through everything together since we were kids, and now [voice breaking] I don't know how to do this without you.
[bitter laugh] Summer camp didn't involve bullets and bombs. [more desperately] What if something happens and I never get to tell you how much you mean to me? [Choked sob] What if our last conversation is about something stupid?
[through tears] Remember the treehouse? [nostalgic whisper] We swore we'd live there forever, just the two of us against the world. [Sniffling] Sometimes I wish we could go back to being eight and believing that was actually possible.
[suddenly urgent] Promise me you'll write. [rapid words] Real letters, not just emails—something I can hold when everything feels too empty here. [pleading] Even if it's just one line saying you're okay, that you're still you.
[angry suddenly] This is so unfair! [louder] Why does it have to be you? There are millions of people in this country. [Breaking down] But no, my best friend has to be the hero. [Bitter sob] I hate this.
[hollow whisper] Your mom made me promise to look after your dog. [trying to smile] Like I wouldn't have stolen him anyway. [voice wobbling] He's going to sleep on your pillow every night until you come back to claim him properly.
[desperate] What if you change? [faster] What if the person who comes back isn't the one who left? [Ragged breath] What if we can't find our way back to this, to us, to everything we've built together here?
[exhausted] I brought you something. [rustling sounds] It's stupid, just that keychain from the arcade—[voice lifting] remember when we spent forty dollars trying to win it? [Soft laugh] Figured you could use some good luck from our misspent youth.
[suddenly clear] When you come back, we're taking that road trip. [building energy] No excuses, no delays—straight to the coast like we always planned. [fiercely] Two weeks of terrible music and gas station coffee, and absolutely no talk about any of this.
[breaking completely] I love you, you know that right? [through sobs] Not romantically, just—you're my person, my family. [gasping] The thought of this world without you in it makes me feel like I'm drowning in advance.
[shouting] What do you mean my daughter has a broken arm?! [voice cracking] I dropped her off at 8:15 this morning perfectly fine, and now you're telling me she's at—at Memorial Hospital on 2847 Oak Street?!
[furiously] The playground equipment? [louder] Which one exactly, because I specifically filled out form 23-B stating she wasn't allowed on the climbing tower! [voice trembling] This is completely unacceptable!
[incredulous] Backwards?! [shouting] Where was the supervision? [sarcastically] Don't I pay $1,850 a month for you people to actually watch these kids?
[voice breaking] Don't give me that! [more angrily] I want to see the security footage from cameras 3 and 4 in the playground area. [demanding] And I want copies of every single staff certification by tomorrow morning!
[bitterly] Oh, how convenient, more paperwork! [louder] My four-year-old is in the hospital with a fractured radius, and you're worried about—about protocols? [scoffs] This is lawsuit material, you understand that?
[quieter] I'm already in my car, doing 75 on Interstate 405! [voice shaking] But don't think this conversation is over. [firmly] I want a meeting with the director Monday at 9 AM sharp!
[sarcastically] Your best wishes? [louder] That's really helpful right now! [sighs heavily] Just have all the documentation ready, including Teacher Rodriguez's file and that other child's information.
[frustrated] Privacy laws! [groans] My baby is hurt and you're protecting the kid who caused this? [more controlled] Fine, but I want the parents contacted—room 4B, the Mitchell boy, right?
[exhausted] You have no idea. [voice cracking] She's four years old, she was so excited about show-and-tell today, brought her—her favorite stuffed unicorn. [sniffling] Now she's getting X-rays instead.
[softer] She did? [sighs] That sounds like my Emma. [more firmly] Look, I'm pulling into the hospital now, parking garage level C-3. [determined] But this isn't over, not by a long shot.
[professionally] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your recent premium notice. [quickly] Yes, I can definitely help explain the increase—let me just pull up your account here and, um, we can go through everything together.
[sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, truly. [more quickly] The increase is actually market-wide—we've seen rising repair costs, medical expenses are up thirty percent, and [pause] unfortunately these factors affect everyone's rates.
[gently] You're absolutely right, everything's more expensive now. [briskly] Let me check what discounts we can apply—are you still, um, working from home? [hopeful] We have new low-mileage options that could save you fifteen percent.
[quickly] Actually, three days qualifies you for our hybrid work discount! [more enthusiastically] Plus, if you bundle with homeowners—wait, do you have that with us? [pause] We could potentially get you back closer to your original rate.
[reassuringly] It's actually much easier than you'd think! [rapidly] We handle all the paperwork, coordinate the switch date, and—here's the thing—bundling would save you about [calculating] two hundred monthly across both policies.
[firmly] No catch, same coverage levels exactly. [more slowly] The savings come from the multi-policy discount, plus that hybrid work reduction, and [quickly] honestly, we really value long-term customers like yourself.
[confidently] No long-term contracts whatsoever! [briskly] You can adjust or cancel anytime—we keep customers by, you know, actually providing value. [chuckles lightly] Not by trapping them with contracts.
[efficiently] Absolutely, I'm preparing that right now actually. [quickly] I'll include both the standalone auto rate and the bundled option, with all applicable discounts itemized—should be in your inbox within five minutes.
[enthusiastically] Perfect timing to ask! [rapidly] We have a good student discount, defensive driving course credits, and if she's using a car with our safe-drive monitoring app, that's another [calculating] ten to fifteen percent off her portion.
[diplomatically] I understand the concern about privacy, really. [more reassuringly] The app only tracks driving behaviors—speed, braking, that sort of thing—not locations or destinations. [quickly] It's completely optional but the savings are substantial.
[Slow] I'm just gonna, um, close my eyes for like one second—just to rest them, you know? [Yawn] Not sleeping, definitely not sleeping.
[Fast] Wait, who's that guy again? [Confused] Is he the—no, that's the other one, right?
[Whisper] If I fall asleep, just, uh, elbow me or something, okay? [Chuckle] But like, gently.
[Angry] This movie is so damn slow—I mean, honestly, when does something actually happen? [Groan]
[Happy] Oh! Oh, this is the good part! [Fast] I'm awake, I'm totally awake now!
[Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm riveted by this, uh, ten-minute establishing shot of a building. [Tsk]
Maybe I should get some—actually, you know what, I'm gonna grab another coffee real quick.
[Disappointed] I really wanted to like this one, but it's just... [Sigh] it's kind of a slog, isn't it?
[Shout] What?! [Fast] No way, I wasn't sleeping—I was just, um, resting my neck!
[Slow] The cinematography is really... really beautiful though, I guess. [Yawn] Very... artistic.
How much longer is this thing anyway—like, are we halfway through or...?
[Sad] I'm sorry, I know you were excited about this one, but I'm just—I'm struggling here. [Sigh]
[Fast] [Laugh] Did I just snore? Please tell me I didn't just snore in the theater!
[Whisper] [Slow] Everything feels so heavy right now, like my eyelids weigh a thousand pounds or something.
I'm gonna try that thing where you, uh, pinch yourself—does that actually work? [Groan]
[Happy] [Chuckle] You know what, let's just make fun of it—that'll keep me entertained at least!
[Sarcastic] [Disappointed] Great, another dream sequence—or wait, is this real? I honestly can't tell anymore.
[Angry] [Fast] Why do they keep the theater so warm and cozy? It's like they want people to pass out!
This popcorn is literally the only thing keeping me conscious right now. [Chuckle]
[Sad] [Whisper] I feel so bad, but I just—I cannot follow what's happening anymore, my brain is like, completely gone.
SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly recounting a shortcut they took driving, then remembering a camera they passed, then wondering if they ran a red light, ending in ticket anxiety
Wait wait wait—what letter? What's official? Oh my god, is this—is this what I think it is?
SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up! Are you—oh my god, are you serious right now? [Gasp] This is huge! This is like, this is literally everything!
Seven—okay, that's actually insane. Like, seven years of just... waiting and paperwork and probably, I dunno, stress eating? How are you so calm about this?
No no no, I get that. It's probably like—honestly? It probably doesn't even feel real yet, right? When's the ceremony thing?
An oath! That's so—wait, that's kinda intense actually. [Chuckle] Like what, you gotta pledge allegiance and stuff? Is it long?
Oh wow, they're—that's amazing! They must be like, completely losing their minds proud right now. Your mom's probably already told everyone she knows.
Okay that's—that's actually really sweet though. I mean, twenty minutes is [Laugh] a lot, but like... this is everything they wanted for you, y'know?
Weird how? Like—wait, are you nervous about it or is it more like... I dunno, complicated feelings about the whole citizenship thing?
That's—honestly that makes total sense. It's like, you're gaining something but also kinda... not losing, but changing something? About who you are? That's gotta be heavy.
Well hey, for what it's worth? I'm like—I'm really, really proud of you. Seven years is... [Sigh] that's a long time to fight for something. You did it though.
Oh—oh no, what jokes? Wait, do you mean the thing from yesterday? Because I was just trying to be funny and—actually, that's not an excuse, I shouldn't have—
The height thing. Right. God, I'm—I'm such an idiot. [nervous laugh] I didn't think it was bothering you that much because you were laughing too, y'know? But that's—that's not really an excuse either.
You weren't—oh. Oh shit. I thought... okay no, you're right, I should've noticed. I just get carried away sometimes when everyone's joking around and I don't—I don't always think before I speak.
Wait wait wait, there's more? What else did I—oh god, the thing about your voice? When you were presenting? I meant it as like a lighthearted—but that's terrible, isn't it? I'm literally the worst friend. [groan]
I know, I know. You're right. It's like—it's become this stupid habit and I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time? But that's my problem, not yours, and I shouldn't be making you feel bad about yourself. That's so messed up.
No! No no no, absolutely not! I think you're—you're amazing, honestly. I think I just... sometimes when I'm nervous or trying to be funny, I go for the easy joke? And I pick on people I'm comfortable with, which is so backwards and stupid—
That's not—okay, yeah, hearing it like that... [sigh] That sounds awful. I meant comfortable like I feel close to you, but I'm using that closeness in completely the wrong way. Like, I would never make those jokes about someone I didn't know well, which makes this worse, doesn't it?
I'm gonna—I'm gonna stop. Completely. No more jokes about anything personal, I swear. And if I slip up, you can literally just tell me to shut up, okay? I mean it. I don't wanna be that person who makes their friends feel shitty about themselves.
I mean... maybe part of me kinda knew? Like, looking back, you did get quiet sometimes. But I just—I dunno, I convinced myself it was fine because we're friends and friends tease each other, right? But there's teasing and then there's being an actual jerk, and I crossed that line.
No, don't—you shouldn't have to tell me not to be mean about your insecurities. That's like, basic friendship stuff. But I'm really, really glad you're telling me now. And I'm sorry it took you having to confront me about it. I wanna do better. I will do better.
Wait wait wait—approved? Like, approved approved? Oh my god, you're gonna be a foster parent! This is—I mean, how are you even feeling right now?
Oh honey, yeah, no that's—that's totally normal though. Like, you're literally about to change a kid's whole life, y'know? When do they, um, when do they place someone with you?
That's so—okay that's kinda wild actually. Like you just... wait? By the phone? [Nervous laugh] God, I'd be going absolutely insane not knowing.
Stop, that's actually—that's really sweet though. You're already being such a parent! Have you like, bought stuff? Or do you wait until you know their age and everything?
Right right, because you don't—I mean, could be a five-year-old, could be a teenager... [Sigh] This is huge. Like, this is what you've wanted for so long.
Three years, jesus. And all those home visits and background checks and—ugh, I remember when they interviewed ME about you. I was so nervous I'd say something wrong.
I did not—okay fine, maybe a little! But like, they asked why you'd be a good parent and I just... started thinking about how much you've wanted this, y'know?
No no no, don't—don't even go there. You're gonna be incredible. These kids, they need someone stable, someone who actually gives a damn. That's literally you.
Then you just... keep showing up anyway? [Soft chuckle] That's kinda the whole thing, right? Being there even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard, actually.
See? That's—oh my god, that's exactly what I mean. You're already thinking about making them feel safe. You're gonna be so, so good at this.
SCENARIO: discovering the parking meter only takes coins
[hesitant] I didn't think you'd come. [clearing throat] It's been what—seven years? [softer] Mom keeps asking for you though, even with the morphine, she mumbles your name between the beeps of these machines.
[exhausted sigh] The doctors say maybe days. [trembling] Her liver's completely shot—all those years of drinking finally caught up. [accusatory] Where were you when I was cleaning up her vomit at three in the morning?
[through tears] Someone had to take care of her. [sharper] You just ran away to California the second things got hard. [wavering] Dad would've been so disappointed seeing us like this, standing here arguing.
[shocked whisper] He never said that. [building anger] You're making things up again, just like when we were kids. [broken voice] God, even now, even here, you're trying to rewrite history to make yourself feel better.
[soft laugh] She'd make those elaborate French braids. [wistful] You always got the pink ribbons; I got blue. [cracking voice] I found a box of those ribbons last week while cleaning out her apartment.
[sniffling] What would we even say? [sardonic] Hey Mom, your daughters finally stopped hating each other long enough to watch you die? [quieter] She probably can't even hear us through all the medications anyway.
[joining in] We love you, Mom. [steadier] And we forgive you—for all of it. [breath catching] The missed recitals, the forgotten birthdays, the promises you couldn't keep. We understand now that you were sick.
[disbelief] Her eyes are fluttering. [louder] Mom? Mom, can you see us? [desperately hopeful] Both your girls are here, just like you wanted. Katie came all the way from San Francisco.
[recognition dawning] The letter. [faster] She kept saying something about a letter in Dad's desk. [confused] I thought she was just rambling, but maybe—Katie, what if there's something there?
[peaceful] Together sounds right. [warm tone] Maybe grab coffee first, catch up properly? [tentative hope] I have two kids now—twins. They have your stubborn streak, believe it or not.
[professionally] Thank you for calling StreamPlus support, I understand your frustration. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account—K47-B92-MM4, correct? [apologetically] I see you've had some trouble with our website, and I'm sorry about that.
[understanding] I completely understand, and looking at your account here, you've been a member since 2021. [more softly] Before we proceed with the cancellation, [professionally] may I ask what specific issues led to this decision—was it the content, or perhaps the pricing?
[sympathetically] That's totally understandable, subscription fatigue is real these days. [more enthusiastically] What if I could offer you our lite plan for just $7.99 a month? [hopefully] That's a 68% discount, and you'd keep access to our core library.
[acknowledging] I respect your decision, absolutely, and I'll process that cancellation right away. [carefully] Just to confirm, you want to cancel effective immediately? [informatively] You'll lose access at the end of your current billing cycle on November 15th, 2024.
[reassuringly] No additional charges at all—you've already paid through November 15th, so you're just getting what you've paid for. [professionally] I'm sending a confirmation email to your registered address, [clearly] and your cancellation reference number is CX-20241024-7789B. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help with today?
[professionally] Good afternoon, this is Mike from Precision Home Inspections returning your call. [clearing throat] I understand you have some concerns about the inspection report we completed yesterday?
[defensively] Sir, I assure you I did access the attic through the pull-down stairs. [more firmly] The moisture readings were off the charts, and there were visible—[pause]—dark stains on several rafters.
[quickly, nervously] Well, sometimes these issues aren't visible in photos, especially if—if taken with flash. [more confidently] Mold can hide behind insulation, and my thermal camera picked up significant temperature variations.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, truly. [speaking faster] Perhaps we should schedule a reinspection—no charge obviously—and I can bring my moisture meter documentation from yesterday's visit.
[calmly] Sir, I've been doing this for fifteen years, and I stand by my findings. [more assertively] However, if there's been an error, we need to—to rectify this immediately. [urgently] Can we meet at the property this afternoon?
[briskly] I'll be there with my full kit and all yesterday's readings documented. [reassuringly] We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise you that.
[slightly offended] Mr. Davidson, I did access that attic, and I have the photos to—[catching himself] [more professionally] Let's review everything together at three, shall we?
[quickly] That's absolutely your right, and honestly, I'd welcome a second opinion. [confidently] Professional oversight never hurt anyone, especially when there's this much confusion.
[earnestly] Sir, I report what I see, nothing more, nothing less. [pause] If I made an error—which I doubt—but if I did, [firmly] I'll own it completely.
[professionally] Understood completely. [speaking quicker] I'll also bring contact information for remediation specialists, just in case my findings are confirmed and you need quick action for the sellers.
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, thanks for, um, "accidentally" scheduling that meeting during my lunch break for the third time this week. [Tsk] [Fast] Real subtle.
[Disappointed] I just—I don't understand why every email has to have that little dig at the end, you know? [Sigh]
[Whisper] Did you hear what she said about my presentation? [Slow] Something about how it was "surprisingly competent for someone at my level."
[Happy] No no, I actually love getting credit for my work! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Even if it's, like, buried in the appendix where nobody'll see it.
[Angry] I'm gonna—actually, you know what, I'm done pretending those comments are just jokes. [Groan]
[Fast] Okay so basically they're saying I did it wrong but they won't actually tell me what the right way is? [Disappointed] [Tsk]
[Sad] It's kinda exhausting, honestly, trying to figure out if they're actually mad or just being... them. [Sigh]
[Shout] Yes, I heard you the first time! [Angry] [Fast] The passive-aggressive sticky notes aren't making your point any clearer!
[Slow] I mean, when someone says "whatever you think is best" but then, like, undermines every decision you make... [Disappointed] [Sigh]
[Chuckle] Sure, cc'ing the boss on every tiny thing is totally normal behavior, right? [Sarcastic]
[Whisper] [Fast] They literally waited until I left to redo the entire project setup—didn't even tell me, I just found out from Sarah.
[Happy] Oh, I'm fine! [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Just peachy with being volunteered for weekend work through a group email!
[Angry] The thing is—no, actually, forget professional courtesy, they're just being a jerk at this point. [Groan]
[Sad] [Slow] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, um, if I'm being too sensitive about this whole situation or if it's really happening.
[Disappointed] Another backhanded compliment about how I'm "getting better at least"—gee, thanks for the, uh, the encouragement. [Tsk]
[Fast] [Whisper] Quick question—is it normal for someone to "forget" to invite you to team drinks like four times in a row?
[Shout] I wasn't even—I didn't ask for your help! [Angry] [Fast] But sure, go ahead and tell everyone how you "fixed" my work!
[Chuckle] Y'know, I've started keeping screenshots of everything 'cause somehow my ideas become their ideas pretty quickly. [Sarcastic]
[Slow] [Sad] It's the constant little comments that just... they kinda wear you down after a while, I guess. [Sigh]
[Happy] Honestly? [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Nothing says "teamwork" like being told you're "brave" for presenting that "interesting" approach!
SCENARIO: Casually mentioning a small lie they told at work, then thinking about documentation, then realizing there's a paper trail that contradicts them, ending in professional lie anxiety
Oh god, okay—I know, I know exactly what this is about. Listen, I was having such a weird night and I didn't mean to—actually no, that's not an excuse. I'm sorry.
Wait, they cried? Oh no no no, I didn't—I had no idea they actually... [groan] This is so much worse than I thought. I'm such an idiot.
I just—okay, I was trying to be funny, y'know? Like that thing where you tease someone to break the ice but I totally misread the room and went way too far. I didn't realize they'd take it so personally.
I do! I do know that, which makes it even worse honestly. I just got carried away with the whole—ugh, I dunno, trying to seem cool or whatever. [nervous laugh] Which obviously backfired spectacularly.
They—what? No, are you serious? God, I'm literally the worst friend. I should've just kept my mouth shut instead of making those stupid comments about their job.
Right, yeah, that too. I was just—I was nervous meeting them properly for the first time and when I'm nervous I just kinda... word vomit everywhere. But that's not—they don't deserve that.
Can I—would it be okay if I called them? To apologize? Or would that make it worse? I genuinely wanna make this right but I don't know if they'd even wanna hear from me at this point. [sigh]
Yeah, of course they are. God, I really really messed up. Look, I'll—I'll write them a proper apology. Like not a text, an actual letter or something. Would that help?
And you—are we okay? I mean, I know we're not okay okay, but like... you're my best friend and I basically insulted the person you love. That's so messed up of me.
Okay. Yeah, that's—that's fair. Thank you for even talking to me about this instead of just... cutting me off. I promise I'll fix this. Whatever it takes, seriously.
Wait wait wait—your what? The potato— [Gasp] oh my god, the crispy smashed potato thing? That went viral?
That's—okay that's actually insane. Like, literally insane. How are you feeling about it? Because I'd be, um, totally freaking out right now, honestly.
Australia! Okay no no no, that's—you're literally international now! Have you been, like, reading all the comments and stuff?
But it's YOUR potatoes! I mean—okay yeah, but like, you created something that people actually love, y'know? That's kinda [Laugh] that's amazing though.
Oh god, the—ugh, the influencer types? They're probably gonna, like, steal your recipe and pretend they invented it or something. Are you gonna respond?
Well maybe you should! I mean—wait, actually, do you even want one? Because like, this could be a whole thing if you wanted it to be.
Of course she does! [Chuckle] That's so—that's such a mom thing. She's probably telling literally everyone she knows, right? Like "my child's famous on the internet!"
Stop it—there's a remix? Of potatoes? I need to—okay you're sending me that immediately because that sounds absolutely ridiculous and I'm kinda here for it.
They're WHAT? No no no, that's—that's not okay! That's literally your thing! Are you gonna, like, do something about that? Because that's basically stealing, right?
Okay but still—I mean, you're being way too chill about this. You basically broke the internet with potatoes and you're just... sitting there. That's the most you thing ever, honestly.
SCENARIO: discovering their phone charger only works at a certain angle
[whispered] Look at them up there. [voice breaking] My little Emily's actually remembering all her lines. [sniffling] I thought she'd freeze like in the living room rehearsals, but she's absolutely glowing under those lights.
[growling] Twenty years, Sal. [louder] Twenty goddamn years we ran this neighborhood together! [Bitter laugh] And now I find out you've been feeding information to the Torrelli family behind my back this whole time.
[shocked whisper] My nephew? [building rage] You're lying through your teeth! [Slamming sound] That kid would never cross me, unlike you, selling us out for what—a bigger cut of the waterfront action?
[trembling with fury] Survive? [screaming] We're dead men walking now! Every family in the city knows we can't keep our house clean. [lower, menacing] You signed our death warrants with your greed.
[through gritted teeth] I trusted you with everything—my business, my family's safety. [voice cracking] My daughter calls you Uncle Sal! [Roaring] How do I explain to her that Uncle Sal got her father killed?
[disbelieving] Your mother? [Hollow laugh] That's your excuse? We swore an oath on our fathers' graves! [quieter, deadly] Blood before everything else, remember? Or did that mean nothing to you?
[quiet rage] Marino was different. He was stealing from the family, not protecting it. [voice rising] But you? [Disgusted exhale] You sold our routes, our contacts, our entire operation's blueprint to our enemies!
[stunned silence] [whispering] How did you... [explosive] That was to keep them off our backs! I was feeding them false information about the Torrellis, you idiot! It was all part of the plan!
[weary] Because I couldn't trust anyone. [more bitterly] Turns out I was right. [Shaking voice] The paranoia, the sleepless nights—all justified. Even my oldest friend would stick a knife in my back.
[softly] Is that what this is about? [incredulous shout] Your ego? [quieter, dangerous] People are going to die because you felt disrespected? Our whole crew will be slaughtered within the week!
[contemplative] Run? [Bitter laugh] After everything we built? [firm resolve] No, if I'm going down, I'm taking every last one of those bastards with me, including the rat who sold us out.
[confused] Hi, I'm calling about my appointment—I think it's Thursday at 2:30? [hesitant] My confirmation number is, uh, K47-B92, but [trails off] the text message says something different about Dr. Peterson?
[frustrated] No, no, that can't be right—I specifically asked for Thursday because, well, [sighs] I work Wednesdays. [more insistently] And who's Dr. Martinez? I've been seeing Dr. Peterson for three years!
[exasperated] The 18th? That's—wait, [groans] that's two weeks away! [pleading] Look, my prescription expired last Tuesday, patient ID number 558921, and I literally can't see properly without my glasses.
[relieved] North Hills, that's... [calculating] maybe twenty minutes? [eagerly] Yes, I'll take it! [quickly] But wait, do they accept my BlueCross insurance, plan number BC-44829-X?
[worried] Fifteen minutes early means... [mumbles] 11:30. [anxiously] And you're sure, absolutely sure it's tomorrow, November 3rd? [desperately] Because last time there was a mix-up and I waited for an hour.
[uncertain] That's my old number—no, wait, [correcting] it ends in 0174, not 0147. [sighs heavily] This is why I can't see anything clearly, these numbers all blur together without my glasses.
[suddenly remembering] Oh God, I just remembered—[panicked] my insurance card says I need referral code from my primary doctor! [frantically] Do I need to call Dr. Walsh's office first, or can you handle that?
[doubtful] Are you absolutely certain? Because last year at your Riverside office, [frustrated mumble] they made me wait while they called to verify, and—[trails off] actually, maybe that was for something else entirely.
[relieved sigh] Okay, okay, so tomorrow, 11:30 arrival for 11:45 appointment. [confirming] North Hills, 7661 Maple Avenue, Dr. Martinez, confirmation J89-C21. [chuckles nervously] I should probably write this down somewhere.
[grateful] Thank you so much for your patience—I know I'm probably, uh, [embarrassed] not the easiest customer today. [sincerely] These blurry weeks have been really frustrating, honestly.
[briskly] Good afternoon, this is Sarah with HomeGuard Warranty Services, how can I— [more cheerfully] Oh, I see you're calling about claim number 47829. [quickly] Unfortunately, that claim has been denied due to, uh, pre-existing damage conditions.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir, I really do. [more formally] According to our technician's report dated last Tuesday, there was significant rust and— [quickly] corrosion present that indicates long-term deterioration, not covered under your policy terms.
[defensively] Sir, our technicians are fully certified and trained to identify— [sighs] Look, I can escalate this to my supervisor if you'd like. [more quietly] But honestly, the decision rarely changes once the initial assessment is complete.
[quickly] I'll need to place you on a brief hold while I— [more reassuringly] Actually, wait, let me check something first. [rapidly] Sometimes if there's documentation of regular maintenance, we can file an appeal through a different department.
[genuinely] No, no, this could actually work in your favor. [more enthusiastically] If you can email those receipts to claims-review@homeguard.com, I'll— [quickly] I'll personally flag it for expedited review within 24 hours.
[urgently] Sir, before you consider that, please know that— [more calmly] Once we receive your documentation, there's a strong chance for reversal. [quickly] I'm noting your account now with my direct extension, 2847.
[sympathetically] Oh, in-laws visiting without hot water would be— [chuckles nervously] That's definitely urgent. [more professionally] I'm marking this as priority and, between you and me, mentioning the weekend deadline in my notes.
[understanding] Trust me, I get at least ten calls like yours daily. [more quietly] The system isn't perfect, but— [quickly] Send those receipts with "Attention Sarah" in the subject line, it'll come straight to me.
[hesitantly] Well, I shouldn't really say specific numbers, but— [whispers] With proper maintenance documentation? [more confidently] About seventy percent get overturned, especially for water heaters.
[impressed] Photos too? Perfect, that definitely helps our case. [briskly] Once I receive them, I'll call you directly with an update, no need to— [quickly] to wait on hold or explain everything again.
[Disappointed] I mean, we literally said seven-thirty, and it's—what, almost nine now? [Sigh] I dunno why I even bother making reservations anymore.
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, you're actually here! [Chuckle] Should I, like, mark this historic moment in my calendar or something?
[Happy] You know what, I'm just gonna start telling you the wrong time—like, two hours early! [Laugh] Problem solved, right?
[Angry] This is the third time this week you've left me sitting here like an idiot! [Groan] I'm done, seriously.
[Whisper] Everyone's staring at me 'cause I've been alone at this table for forty-five minutes. [Tsk] It's honestly embarrassing.
[Fast] Okay so next time—and I mean this—next time you're late, I'm leaving, no questions asked. [Disappointed] I gotta draw the line somewhere.
[Sad] I just... I feel like my time doesn't matter to you, y'know? [Sigh] That's what it feels like.
[Shout] Are you kidding me right now?! [Angry] The movie started an hour ago!
[Slow] You ever notice how, um, how I'm always the one waiting? [Disappointed] [Tsk] It's kinda becoming a pattern here.
[Chuckle] My other friends have started taking bets on how late you'll be. [Sarcastic] Jerry won twenty bucks last week, so thanks for that.
[Happy] [Fast] Actually, being early gave me time to—oh wait, you wouldn't know what that's like, would you? [Laugh]
[Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if you're late on purpose, like maybe you just... don't wanna hang out anymore.
[Angry] [Fast] Don't even—don't you dare give me the traffic excuse again, we both know you left your house ten minutes ago!
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Let me guess, your alarm didn't go off, or wait—no, your cat had an emergency, right?
[Disappointed] I already ate, paid the bill, and basically had dinner with the waiter instead. [Sigh] He was actually pretty interesting, so... thanks?
[Shout] [Happy] Hey, you made it before midnight! That's gotta be some kind of record! [Laugh]
[Tsk] You realize the surprise party was, uh, supposed to be a surprise, right? [Angry] She got here before you did!
[Sad] [Slow] I used to defend you when people called you flaky, but I'm kinda running out of excuses here.
[Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh no no, take your time, I'm just—I'm literally aging while I wait, but sure, stop for coffee!
[Whisper] Honestly? [Sigh] I've started bringing a book everywhere 'cause I know—I just know you're gonna be at least half an hour late.
SCENARIO: Excited about a job lead, then worried it won't work out, then gets a call to schedule an interview
Wait wait wait—the one you auditioned for last week? The—oh my god, the national one? Are you serious right now?
I'm gonna—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is so huge! What's it for again? Some kinda... was it insurance or something?
Stop it. You're gonna be the cereal dad? [Laugh] That's—honestly that's adorable. Wait, so when do you start filming? Do you get, like, free cereal for life or—
Tuesday! That's so soon! Oh my god, are you—are you nervous? I'd be completely freaking out right now. Like, completely.
Okay but it's YOUR thirty seconds, y'know? Your face on TV! Have you told your parents yet? Your mom's gonna absolutely lose it—in the best way.
I'm—wait, I'm first? [Softer] Oh babe, that's so sweet. But like, why aren't you more excited? This is literally what you've been working towards!
Weird how? Like imposter syndrome weird or like... something else? Because honestly, you deserve this. You've been grinding at those auditions for what—two years now?
Four callbacks means they really, really wanted you specifically. Not just anyone—you. That's gotta mean something, right? [Sigh] I dunno, I just hate seeing you doubt yourself.
See! There we go—that's something! How good are we talking? Like, quit-your-day-job good or just nice-vacation good?
Okay okay okay—now you're just being modest. Six months?! That's—you're buying dinner next time, just so we're clear. And I want the fancy place with the little bread rolls.
SCENARIO: noticing their zipper has been down
[knowingly] Mija, your headache won't go away until you put a potato slice on your forehead. [more insistent] My mother taught me this, and her mother before her. [Soft chuckle] Trust your abuela—these old remedies work better than pills.
[defensive whisper] Science doesn't know everything, mi amor. [building volume] When you were a baby with colic, I rubbed an egg over your belly and you stopped crying! [triumphant] Explain that with your Google searches!
[Scoff] Medicine, medicine! [in a mocking tone] Your grandfather had pneumonia once and I cured him with onion tea and prayer. [quieter] The doctors said he wouldn't make it, but look—forty more years he lived.
[warmly] Ah, now you're learning! [mysterious whisper] The soup has my secret—a blessing whispered three times while stirring clockwise. [more firmly] Your cousin Maria's fever broke after just one bowl last week, you saw it yourself.
[Cackling] Weird? [indignant] Being healthy is weird now? [in a low rumble] Fine, when everyone else catches that nasty cold going around, don't come crying to me for my eucalyptus steam treatment that actually works.
[smugly] So now you admit I know things! [rapid fire] The hiccup cure, the nightmare prevention, the evil eye ward—all real, mija. [whispering intensely] Your modern world forgot the wisdom our ancestors discovered through centuries.
[Gentle laugh] The lavender is my grandmother's recipe—picked under a full moon, dried with rosemary. [nostalgic tone] She lived to ninety-six with barely a sniffle. [firmly] These traditions kept our family strong through everything.
[hurt quietly] You think I'm just a foolish old woman. [more passionate] But when you have children, you'll understand—sometimes love and tradition heal what medicine cannot touch. [Sniffling] A mother knows things science hasn't discovered yet.
[considering slowly] Maybe... but you must promise to try my ginger compress for your cramps. [excited whisper] And wear the red string I blessed! [Chuckle] Your science can't hurt either, I suppose—extra protection never killed anyone.
[grumbling] Fine, fine, hospitals for emergencies. [brighter] But everything else, we try my way first! [confident declaration] Your children will thank me someday when they know both worlds—the old wisdom and the new.
[confused] Um, excuse me, I was just browsing around and saw this—this 3D printer thing? [hesitant] Model XR-2400, I think the tag says. [curiously] What exactly needs calibrating on these machines, because honestly, I don't even know why I'm looking at it.
[overwhelmed] Wait, wait, Z-what now? [laughs nervously] I came in here for a phone charger and somehow ended up in aisle 14-B staring at this thing. [bewildered] Does it really need that much adjusting?
[skeptical] Fifty hours? [groans] That's like—I don't know—two full days of printing stuff? [in a slower tone] What happens if you don't calibrate it, does it just explode or something?
[amused] Spaghetti printing? [snorts] That actually sounds kind of fun though. [thoughtfully] So if I hypothetically bought this $1,299 machine—which I'm not—how long would calibration take?
[sarcastically] Oh great, more letters and numbers! [sighs deeply] G29, E-steps... it's like learning a new language. [genuinely curious] Do people actually enjoy fiddling with all these settings at home?
[surprised] Twenty-four seven support? [impressed] That's more available than my therapist! [jokingly] Maybe I should call them about my life calibration issues too, heh.
[thoughtfully] Fifty thousand people talking about nozzles? [whistles] That's a lot of—um—nozzle enthusiasm. [more seriously] What's the worst calibration mistake someone could make with this thing?
[shocked] Eighty-nine dollars for one part?! [groans loudly] My entire shopping list today was under fifty bucks! [resignedly] How often do these expensive bits need replacing anyway?
[sarcastically] Oh good, only twelve dollars for a tube! [chuckles] I don't even know what PTFE stands for but sure. [curiously] Do you personally own one of these calibration nightmares?
[amazed] Fourteen hours for a dragon? [exhales] That's longer than my last relationship! [laughing] You know what, I'm still just gonna buy my phone charger, but this was weirdly educational.
[professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling the Grand Metropolitan Hotel. [briskly] How may I assist you today?
[sympathetically] I understand that must be frustrating, sir. [more quickly] Let me pull up your reservation—may I have your confirmation number?
[typing pace] Alright, I see your booking here for tomorrow. [more hesitantly] Unfortunately, our cancellation policy requires 48 hours notice, so [apologetically] there would be a charge of one night's stay.
[calmly] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [more firmly] However, the policy applies regardless of the reason, though [quickly] I can offer you a credit for a future stay instead of losing the full amount.
[professionally] Certainly, I can transfer you to my supervisor. [more briskly] Before I do, I should mention—if you have travel insurance, [helpfully] they typically cover these types of cancellations due to flight issues.
[encouragingly] Yes, exactly! [quickly] If you file a claim with them first, then send us the approval, [more warmly] we can process a full refund within 3-5 business days.
[understandingly] No apologies necessary, travel disruptions are incredibly stressful. [efficiently] Let me email you the documentation requirements right now—what's the best address?
[warmly] That's very kind of you to say. [briskly] I've sent that email—you should see it momentarily with all the steps clearly outlined.
[quickly] The credit would be valid for twelve months from today's date. [reassuringly] You can apply it to any room type, even during peak season, though [matter-of-factly] blackout dates around major holidays do apply.
[professionally] Perfect, that sounds like a good plan. [helpfully] If you need any assistance with the documentation or have questions, [warmly] just reference this case number—TR-9982—when you call back.
[Slow] So, um, you were saying about the conference—sorry, I'm totally blanking on your, uh... [Nervous laugh] [Fast] remind me again?
[Happy] Oh my god, yes! [Laugh] That's exactly what—wait, hold on, I literally just had your name and now it's gone!
[Whisper] I know we met at Sarah's party, and I remember your face perfectly, but your name is just... [Tsk] [Sigh] not coming to me.
[Angry] This is so frustrating—I pride myself on remembering names and I just—ugh! [Groan] It's right there on the tip of my tongue!
[Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm doing great, just having a complete mental breakdown trying to remember what to call you. [Chuckle] Super professional of me, right?
[Fast] Okay so I'm gonna be honest here—I'm terrible with names and yours is just, like, completely gone from my brain. [Disappointed] I'm so sorry.
[Slow] Was it... Michael? [Tsk] No, that's not—Marcus maybe?
[Shout] Wait! Don't tell me! [Happy] I got this, I got this—it starts with a J, doesn't it?
[Sad] I feel awful about this, but I literally cannot—your name has just vanished and I... [Sigh] I really should know this.
[Disappointed] We've worked together for, what, three months? [Slow] And I still can't get your name to stick in my head properly.
[Fast] You know what's weird? [Chuckle] I remember you hate cilantro and have two cats, but your actual name? Completely gone.
[Whisper] Please don't be offended, but I'm having the worst—like, the absolute worst brain fog right now. [Nervous laugh] What was your name again?
[Angry] My brain is literally betraying me right now—I swear I knew this five seconds ago! [Groan] [Fast] This is embarrassing.
[Happy] Oh, you're gonna laugh at this, but I've been calling you "coffee shop guy" in my head for weeks! [Laugh] What's your actual name?
[Sarcastic] Sure, let me just pretend I haven't forgotten the most basic piece of information about you. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Real smooth.
[Slow] I wanna say... Rebecca? [Sad] No, that's my dentist—sorry, I'm mixing everyone up today.
[Shout] Don't move! [Fast] If you stay really still, maybe your name will come back to me—is that how memory works?
[Disappointed] This is gonna sound bad, but, um... [Sigh] I've been avoiding saying your name for like ten minutes now.
[Whisper] Hey, so this is awkward, but my ex has the same name as you and I keep—I dunno, blocking it out? [Chuckle] [Fast] What is it again?
[Happy] You know what? [Laugh] Let's just start over—hi, I'm having a complete mental meltdown, what's your name?
SCENARIO: Frustrated about a broken appliance, then hits it and it starts working
Oh my—wait, what? Are you... are you serious right now? I mean, obviously you're serious, you wouldn't joke about—wow. Okay. Um, how are you feeling?
This morning? So this is like, brand new information. God, no wonder you seem kinda... shell-shocked? Do you wanna talk about it or—actually, wait, have you told anyone else yet?
Just me. Okay. Okay okay. [Exhale] That's—I'm honored, honestly? But also like, holy shit. Sorry, I'm trying to be calm but this is huge. Have you, um, have you thought about what you're gonna do?
No no no, that makes total sense. You literally just found out. Your brain's probably doing that thing where it's like... processing but also not processing, y'know? It's a lot.
Do you—I mean, does he know? Or wait, am I allowed to ask that? I don't wanna pry, but like... you don't have to go through this alone is all I'm saying. [Softer] You know that, right?
Oh. Oh shit. That's—okay that definitely complicates things. Two weeks ago means... wait, you were already—but didn't know—god, that timing is actually cruel.
Are you gonna tell him? I mean, you don't have to decide right now, obviously. But like... ugh, this is so hard. I just wanna hug you. Can I—can I come over? Bring food or something?
Yeah, no, I get that. Your stomach's probably doing the whole— [Groan] anxiety thing. But you should eat something, even if it's just like, crackers or whatever. Keep your strength up while you figure this out, y'know?
Totally. Totally fair. Just... sitting with it is good. But hey, whenever you're ready to like, talk through options or cry or scream or literally whatever you need? I'm here. Day or night, seriously.
Of course, babe. That's what I'm here for. And listen—whatever you decide? It's gonna be the right choice because it's yours, okay? Just... remember that.
Oh—um, what do you mean? Did I—wait, did I do something wrong? I mean, I probably did, I just... I'm not sure what specifically you're talking about?
Okay, okay, you're mad. I can tell you're mad. Is this about—oh god, is this about earlier? When you were talking about your trip and I brought up Barcelona? [nervous laugh] That was—I didn't mean to—
Oh. Oh no. I—wait, I do that? No no no, I mean, I guess I do but I never—it's not on purpose! I swear it's not like I'm trying to compete or anything, I just get excited and—
That's not—I don't think they're better! I really don't! It's just like, when you share something it reminds me of something similar and I wanna connect, y'know? Like "oh hey, me too!" But I'm—[groan] I'm realizing how that sounds now.
God, I'm—I'm so sorry. Really. I had no idea I was doing that to you. I mean, thinking about it now, I can totally see it. My mom literally does the same thing and it drives me crazy so I should've—I should've known better.
You're right. You're completely right and that's—that's awful of me. I think I just get carried away? Like I genuinely think I'm relating but actually I'm just... hijacking. Your moments. Which is so messed up, I'm sorry.
You should be! You absolutely should be—it was huge! And I just—god, I trampled all over it talking about my thing, didn't I? [sigh] I'm such an idiot. You worked so hard for that and I couldn't just... let you have it.
I don't—I dunno why I do this. Maybe I'm just really insecure or something? But that's not an excuse, I know it's not. Your stories matter and I should be listening, actually listening, not just waiting for my turn to—to show off or whatever I'm doing.
Wait wait wait—you dread talking to me? Oh man, that's... that really hurts to hear but I—I get it. I do. And I'm gonna fix this, okay? Like, I'm literally gonna tape my mouth shut if I have to.
Yes. Yes, absolutely. From now on when you tell me something, I'm gonna actually celebrate it with you instead of making it about—about me. I promise. And if I slip up, which I probably will at first, just... call me out? Please? I wanna be better at this. At being your friend.
I know, I know how it looks, but honestly, I didn't mean to bail on you again. Things just—they got crazy at work and then my mom needed help with her car, and I literally couldn't make it.
That's not—okay, that's not entirely fair. I show up for stuff! I was there for your birthday, I helped you move, I—[scoff] you're making it sound like I'm this total flake.
And I wanted to be there! I did! But my boss literally called me in last minute and I can't just—I can't lose this job, okay? You know that.
Look look, I get that you're mad, but I'm trying to help people when they ask. I don't wanna be that person who just says no to everything. [frustrated laugh] Sorry for actually caring about people, I guess.
Okay, that's—wow. That's kinda harsh. I'm not "disappearing," things come up. Life happens. And honestly? You're not exactly understanding about it when it does.
Not always! That's such an—ugh, that's such an exaggeration and you know it. Yeah, fine, I've had to cancel some stuff lately, but I'm drowning here trying to keep everyone happy.
What's that supposed to mean? Stop trying to be a good friend? Stop trying to—I mean, I thought that's what friends do, they try to show up for each other.
[Sigh] I know I messed up the fundraiser thing, okay? I feel terrible about it. But you're acting like I do this on purpose, like I wake up thinking "how can I let people down today?"
Because people need help! My sister needs babysitting, my coworker needs a ride, you need fundraiser help—I can't just tell everyone to fuck off, can I? I'm trying to juggle everything here.
Fine. Fine, you're right. I should've—I should've said no from the start. But honestly? [quieter] Sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, it's gonna disappoint someone. Including you.
SCENARIO: noticing the thing they threw away is now in the recycling
[Screaming] WE GOT IT! WE GOT THE MORRISON ACCOUNT! [jumping up and down] Three years of pitching, and they finally said yes! [voice cracking with joy] I can't believe this is actually happening right now!
[Breathless] I just got off the phone with their CEO! [squealing] She loved our sustainability angle! [more excited] Remember when everyone said we were crazy for that green initiative pivot? WHO'S CRAZY NOW?!
[Quieter, trembling] My mom didn't believe in this company. [building volume] She said I should've stayed at my corporate job. [explosive] LOOK AT US NOW, MOM! We're about to expand to three new offices!
[Sobbing with joy] I haven't slept properly in six months. [sniffling] All those rejected proposals, the failed pitches... [triumphant yell] Every single "no" led us to this massive, beautiful, life-changing YES!
[Sing-song voice] We're getting bonuses, we're getting bonuses! [normally] Remember eating ramen for three months straight? [roaring] GOODBYE INSTANT NOODLES, HELLO MICHELIN STARS! This is our moment! Our actual moment!
[Incredulous] They want us to start next Monday. [panicked excitement] NEXT MONDAY! That's four days away! [determined shout] We need to hire twenty people, like, yesterday! This is beautifully terrifying!
[Shaky voice] I keep thinking I'm dreaming. [firmly] But the email is right here—it's real. [overwhelming joy] Our tiny startup just beat out three Fortune 500 companies. David just destroyed Goliath!
[Hushed intensity] This changes everything—our lives, our futures. [building up] No more wondering if we'll make rent! [exploding] WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FORBES! The "Thirty Under Thirty" list, here we come!
[Giddy] The entire floor probably thinks we've lost our minds. [louder] Let them think whatever they want! [bellowing] WE JUST MADE COMPANY HISTORY! Ten years from now, they'll tell stories about today!
[Softly reverent] We actually pulled it off. [growing stronger] All those people who believed in us were right. [joyful sob] I'm so proud of us—we're going to change this entire industry forever.
[professionally] Good morning! I can help you with that sensor installation. [reassuringly] Let me pull up your account—could you confirm if you're at unit 12A or 12B? [more gently] And don't worry, I'll verify that account number for you right away.
[sympathetically] I completely understand, and we'll make this as easy as possible for you. [cheerfully] I see here account KX-7742-B for unit 12A at Oak Ridge. [helpfully] Would you prefer our basic package with 6 sensors or the premium with 12?
[optimistically] We actually have a technician available at 2:15 PM today! [efficiently] They'll need access code 9-9-4-7 for your building's main entrance, correct? [considerately] The installation typically takes 45 minutes, so you'll be all set before your nurse leaves.
[reassuringly] No problem at all, I've updated that to 9-4-9-7. [accommodatingly] We can arrange digital consent through your registered email, sarah.chen at gmail. [gently] Or if you prefer, the technician can assist with any necessary paperwork.
[softly] I'm adding a special note for quiet installation to your work order W-55621. [compassionately] Our technician, Marcus, specializes in medical recovery situations. [warmly] Is there anything else we should know to make you more comfortable during the installation process?
[confirmingly] Absolutely, text notification to the number ending in 8-8-3-2, bedroom sensors last. [helpfully] I'm also seeing you qualify for our medical discount—25% off, bringing your monthly monitoring to $47.99. [encouragingly] Should I apply that to your account right now?
[professionally] That case number is perfect for our records, thank you. [cheerfully] I've applied the discount and emailed your confirmation to sarah.chen at gmail. [informatively] The invoice shows installation fee waived due to medical circumstances—that saves you another $199.
[enthusiastically] Yes, the AL-7700-X integrates perfectly with our system! [technically] We'll sync them during installation using protocol 4.2.1. [reassuringly] This means any sensor trigger can also alert your medical response team if needed.
[attentively] I'm noting that Mrs. Peterson in 12C has the spare key for backup access. [confirmingly] Marcus will arrive at 2:15 PM with work order W-55621. [kindly] We'll also send a follow-up call tomorrow to ensure everything's working properly.
[patiently] It's W-55621, and everything's documented in your email. [warmly] Please rest well, and Marcus will take excellent care of the installation. [gently] If you need anything else, our 24-hour line is always here. Take care, Sarah.
[professionally] DMV customer service, this is Patricia speaking. [more quickly] How may I assist you with your licensing needs today?
[calmly] I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. [briskly] Let me pull up your record—could you provide your license number and [more slowly] the last four digits of your social?
[typing tone] Alright, I'm seeing your account here. [concerned] Oh, I do see the issue—it appears the system processed a one-month temporary extension instead of the full renewal. [more apologetically] This shouldn't have happened.
[understanding] Absolutely, you're completely right. [quickly] I'm escalating this to our corrections department right now, and we'll expedite a corrected license. [reassuring] You won't be charged again, of course.
[more firmly] This time it'll be different—five to seven business days, guaranteed. [briskly] I'm also noting your account for priority processing and [pause] waiving any fees for duplicate copies if needed.
[quickly] I'm emailing you a temporary permit right now—check your inbox. [confidently] It's valid for ninety days and serves as [more slowly] legal proof of your valid license status.
[apologetically] Different departments have different protocols, unfortunately. [more briskly] But yes, temporary permits can be emailed instantly for situations exactly like this.
[professionally] Perfect. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help resolve while I have your account open? [helpfully] Address updates, registration renewals, anything?
[chuckles softly] I hear that feedback often, believe me. [conspiratorially] Between you and me, they're supposedly launching a new system [pause] next year.
[warmly] Thank you for your patience, sir. [briskly] Your corrected license will arrive within the week, and that temporary permit is valid immediately. [professionally] Have a great rest of your day.
[Happy] Oh my god, that's, um, that's amazing news! [Fast] I mean, wow, you totally deserve this after everything you've been working on! [Laugh]
[Sarcastic] Well, well, well—look who's finally joining the rest of us successful people, huh? [Chuckle] [Slow] Took you long enough, didn't it?
[Disappointed] Yeah, no, that's—that's great. [Sigh] I guess some people just have all the luck, right?
[Happy] [Fast] This is huge, like seriously huge, and I'm so—I mean, nobody deserves it more than you do! [Tsk]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda thought I'd be the first one to, you know... [Slow] but hey, congratulations anyway.
[Sad] I'm really happy for you, honestly, it's just—[Sigh] never mind, this is your moment and I don't wanna ruin it.
[Shout] Are you kidding me right now? [Happy] [Laugh] That's literally the best thing I've heard all week—well, for you anyway!
[Angry] Of course you got it, I mean—[Fast] no, sorry, that came out wrong, I'm thrilled, really thrilled for you.
[Slow] So, um, when exactly did you find out about this whole thing? [Disappointed] [Tsk] 'Cause I've been waiting for months and nothing.
[Happy] You're gonna be so good at this! [Sarcastic] I mean, some of us have been preparing for years, but sure, you'll figure it out.
[Fast] Wait, they picked YOU? [Happy] [Laugh] That's—wow, okay, that's actually incredible news!
[Whisper] Honestly? [Slow] I applied for the same thing and they basically told me I wasn't ready yet. [Chuckle]
[Disappointed] That's, uh, that's really something. [Sigh] [Fast] Guess I should probably stop comparing myself to everyone else, right?
[Shout] No way! [Happy] This calls for champagne—the expensive stuff that I definitely can't afford anymore! [Laugh]
[Sad] [Slow] You know what's funny? I literally just got rejected from something similar yesterday, but... [Tsk] your timing's perfect.
[Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, another reminder that I'm basically falling behind while everyone else is—[Fast] sorry, I'm being weird, congratulations!
[Angry] I just don't understand how these things work sometimes, like—[Groan] whatever, you earned it, I'm sure.
[Happy] This is exactly what you needed! [Whisper] Even though I kinda needed it more, but we won't talk about that.
[Slow] Remember when we used to joke about who'd make it first? [Disappointed] [Chuckle] Guess we have our answer now, don't we?
[Fast] Okay so basically everyone's gonna be so jealous—I mean, proud! [Happy] [Laugh] Everyone's gonna be so proud of you!
SCENARIO: Offhandedly recounting a time they name-dropped someone, then remembering the context, then cringing at how desperate it sounded, ending in social climbing embarrassment
Oh god—okay, I didn't—I mean I did but it wasn't like... I wasn't gossiping or anything, I swear. We were just talking and it kinda slipped out and I immediately regretted it.
No no no, that's—that's not what I meant. Not slipped out like it was nothing. I just... Marcus was talking about his own anxiety stuff and I wanted to be supportive so I mentioned—[groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I?
I... yeah. I did. God, hearing you say it like that makes me wanna just disappear. I know how private that was, I know you trusted me with that and I just—I completely betrayed that trust, didn't I?
What? No, that's—Marcus wouldn't have told anyone else, he promised me he... [nervous laugh] okay that sounds really stupid now that I'm saying it out loud. Of course he told people. Of course he did.
You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm honestly disgusted with myself right now. Like, you came to me when you were struggling and trusted me with something so personal and I just... treated it like it was nothing.
I know. I know it wasn't. And I think—no, I know that's what makes this so awful. You were being so brave, y'know? Opening up about everything you're going through and I just... I ruined that.
Oh my god, I didn't even think about—that's where everyone hangs out. [sigh] I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I'll talk to them, I'll tell them to stop being weird about it or—or whatever you need me to do.
Right, yeah, talking to them would probably—yeah. Um, is there... is there anything I can do? Like literally anything to make this even a little bit better? I just wanna fix this somehow but I don't—I dunno how.
I know. You're right, I can't just—I can't undo what I did. But maybe I can... I mean, going forward, if you ever wanna talk about anything again—which you probably don't and I totally get that—but I promise I would never, ever break your trust again.
Yeah, no, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—I really am sorry. And I hope... I hope eventually you can forgive me, but I get it if you can't. I really messed up and I—I know that.
Oh god, I—I was gonna tell you, I swear. It wasn't planned or anything, I just—I was driving past the cemetery and I thought I'd stop for like five minutes, you know?
I know, I know how it sounds. But listen, I—I wasn't thinking, okay? I was having such a bad morning and I just needed to [nervous laugh] I dunno, talk to her? That's—that's not an excuse though.
We do. We always do, and I—fuck, I'm so sorry. I wasn't trying to exclude you or anything like that. It was honestly just this impulsive thing where I pulled over and—and then I was already there, y'know?
That was—okay that was really stupid of me. Like genuinely, what was I thinking? I shouldn't have—I mean, of course you'd see it. [Groan] I'm such an idiot sometimes, I really am.
I did! I did, I promise. I told her—I told her you were probably gonna kill me for coming without you, actually. And that you'd probably bring those yellow roses she liked next time.
Oh. Oh no, I—we can go again? Like, together? I know it's not the same but maybe we could go this weekend and—and do it properly this time. The way we always do.
Shit. Shit shit shit, you're right. I didn't even—I wasn't thinking about that. God, I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? [Sigh] I completely ruined it.
Wait, you—you did? What kind of thing? No wait, that's—I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me. I don't deserve to know after what I—after this.
The—the rosé she used to sneak us? Oh man, that's... that's really beautiful actually. We can—we can still do that, right? I mean, if you'll let me come with you?
Yeah. Yeah, of course, take—take all the time you need. I really am sorry though. Like from the bottom of my heart. She meant everything to you and I—I should've remembered that. I should've waited.
Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm literally the worst, I get it. But there was this whole thing with my car and then—wait, that's not even the point. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
No no no, that's—okay, I hear how that sounds. It's not an excuse, I swear, it's just... [sigh] everything keeps happening at once, y'know? Like I genuinely wanna hang out, I do, but then something comes up and I—I dunno, I panic.
Please don't do the one-word thing. I can't—I mean, I deserve it, obviously, but it's killing me. You're like, one of my favorite people and I keep screwing this up and I don't even know why I do this.
What? No! That's not—god, is that really what you think? [nervous laugh] I care so much it's actually embarrassing. I literally had our plans in my calendar, with like three reminders, and then my sister called crying about her boyfriend and I just—I forgot everything else existed.
Okay when you say it like that it sounds—it sounds stupid, I know. But she was really upset and I'm basically the only person she talks to about this stuff, and I meant to text you but then hours went by and—ugh, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Making excuses.
I don't mean to be like this. Honestly, I think there's something wrong with me? Like I get so overwhelmed and then I just... freeze. And then I'm too anxious to reach out because I know you're mad—which makes it worse, I know I know.
You're right. You're completely right. That's—that's the bare minimum and I couldn't even do that. [groan] I keep telling myself I'm gonna be better, like next time I won't mess up, but then I do and I hate myself for it.
I know. And that's—that's completely fair. Um, what if we just... what if you pick something and I'll be there no matter what? Like literally nothing will stop me. I'll turn off my phone, tell everyone I'm dead, whatever it takes.
No but this time—okay, I hear myself. But I mean it, I really really mean it this time. You matter to me, like so much, and I've been a garbage friend and I wanna fix this. Please let me—just let me prove it? One more chance?
Yes! Okay, yes, one chance. I won't—I promise I won't mess this up. And if I even think about flaking I'll... I dunno, I'll Venmo you a hundred bucks or something. Actually yeah, let's do that. I'm putting it in writing right now.
Wait, what? That was—I thought that was next week? I swear you said the fifteenth, not—god, I'm sorry, but I genuinely didn't know it was today.
Okay, okay, I probably—look, I've been completely underwater with work stuff and I just... [sigh] I know that's not an excuse, but my brain's been like, completely fried lately.
That's not—come on, that's not fair. You know I have issues with this stuff. I'm not just being careless, I literally can't hold onto things sometimes, y'know?
And I wanna be there for you, I do, but you're acting like I'm doing this on purpose. Like I wake up and decide "hey, let's forget something important today." [frustrated laugh] That's not how it works.
Seriously? You're gonna—that's such a low blow. Some things stick better than others, that doesn't mean I don't care about your stuff. I use reminders, I write everything down, I'm trying here.
Look look, I get that you're upset, and you have every right to be, but I'm kinda getting tired of apologizing for something I literally cannot control sometimes.
Oh wow, thanks, never thought of that. Just stop forgetting. [scoff] Why didn't I think of—you know what? You're being really dismissive right now about something that's actually really hard for me.
I'm not—I'm not dismissing it! I feel terrible that I missed it, honestly I do, but I'm also asking for like, a tiny bit of understanding here? Maybe?
Yeah, understanding. The thing friends are supposed to have for each other? I mean, I've been dealing with this my whole life and you're acting like it's some personal attack against you.
And that's—okay, I hear that, I do. But I dunno what else to tell you. I'm doing my best, and if that's not enough for you, then... [trails off] I guess that's where we're at.
SCENARIO: attempting to open packaging that won't cooperate
[concerned] Your eight-year-old was at the park alone yesterday. [voice rising] Did you know that? [Deep breath] I saw him climbing that enormous oak tree with no supervision whatsoever—he could've fallen and seriously hurt himself.
[incredulous] Risk assessment? [louder] He's eight! [Scoff] My daughter doesn't leave our yard without me or my husband present. There are strangers everywhere these days, and accidents happen in seconds when nobody's watching them.
[sarcastically] Thriving? [Sharp exhale] Last week he rode his bike into traffic chasing a ball! [trembling] What if a car had been coming faster? You can't just hope everything works out when children are involved.
[exasperated] Times have changed! [Bitter laugh] We didn't have registered offenders online or distracted drivers on phones. [pleading] Please, at least consider going to the park with him? Other parents are starting to notice and talk.
[hurt] Helicopter parenting? [voice cracking] I'm protecting my child! [more intensely] When something terrible happens—and statistics show it will—you'll wish you'd been more careful. Safety isn't negotiable when it comes to our babies.
[shakily] Mental health matters, yes, but so does physical safety. [growing firmer] There's a middle ground here. [Frustrated groan] Why not gradual independence with check-ins? Start with supervised freedom, then slowly expand their boundaries as they mature?
[relieved] Yes, exactly! [warmer tone] And perhaps our kids could play together sometimes? [hopefully] My Sarah needs more outdoor time, honestly. She's always asking to join Tommy's adventures but I've been too worried.
[hesitant] I suppose we could try that. [steadying] But ground rules first—no tree climbing above ten feet, no leaving the park boundaries. [quickly] And they both need phones or watches to contact us immediately.
[defensively] We'll see about that. [softer] I admit, she has been asking for more independence lately. [Nervous laugh] Maybe I have been a bit overprotective. It's just so hard to let go sometimes.
[resigned] Saturday at ten it is. [more firmly] But I'm bringing hand sanitizer and a first aid kit. [Slight laugh] And don't judge me if I hover for the first few visits, okay?
[cheerfully] Good afternoon! I can definitely help you with that. [reassuring] Let me just pull up your account—can you provide your customer ID number? [more gently] Detection zones are basically areas where you want the camera to specifically monitor for motion, like your driveway or walkway.
[acknowledging] Perfect, I've got your account here, thank you. [explaining patiently] The camera can see everything in its 160-degree field of view, but you can create up to 5 customizable zones. [more enthusiastically] This helps reduce false alerts from, say, trees swaying or cars passing on the street.
[sympathetically] Oh, that sounds really frustrating, I'm sorry about that. [helpfully] Let's set up your zones right now through the app—do you have version 3.2.1 installed? [more specifically] We'll create zones just for your property boundaries at 42 Maple Street.
[reassuring tone] No, no, don't worry, it's actually quite intuitive once you know how. [instructively] Each zone, Z1 through Z5, can be shaped by dragging the corners to cover specific areas. [more clearly] Think of it like drawing a box around only the areas you care about monitoring.
[approvingly] Excellent work! You're getting the hang of it. [thoughtfully] The 75% sensitivity is our default, but for driveways I usually recommend dropping it to about 60% to avoid triggering from small animals. [chuckles softly] Unless you want alerts every time a squirrel runs by.
[enthusiastically] Great question! Package detection is actually a separate AI feature that works within your zones. [explaining] Once you enable it in settings under PD-001, it'll specifically look for package-shaped objects. [more detailed] It's especially useful if you get lots of deliveries to 42 Maple Street.
[quickly] That's normal for the premium features—check your email for code starting with VER-. [helpfully] It should have been sent to the email on file when you registered your SG2K-4B7X yesterday. [reassuring] Sometimes it goes to spam, so check there too.
[pleased] Wonderful! You've done a fantastic job setting everything up. [informatively] Just remember, it takes about 24-48 hours for the AI to learn your specific property patterns at 42 Maple. [more gently] So you might still get a few extra alerts initially.
[warmly] Yes, that's your permanent customer ID, keep that handy. [professionally] I'm also sending you our quick reference guide to your email—document QRG-2024-ZONES. [cheerfully] It has pictures showing different zone setup examples that might help even more.
[confidently] Absolutely! Just toggle the zone on or off using the switches next to Z1 through Z5 in your app. [reassuringly] Your settings stay saved, so you can reactivate anytime. [friendly closing] Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your SmartGuard Pro 2000 today?
[professionally] Good afternoon, Riverside Credit Union, this is Sarah speaking. [quickly] How may I assist you with your account today?
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir. [briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—could you provide me your member number and last name please? [more reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out for you.
[quickly] Thank you Mr. Morrison, I'm seeing your application here. [pause] [concerned] It appears there was a—well, a discrepancy with your employment verification form. [more gently] Our underwriting team sent a request for additional documentation last Tuesday.
[defensively] Let me check the contact log here... [rapidly] Shows we sent it to the email on file ending in gmail-dot-com. [more carefully] Sometimes these messages do end up in spam folders unfortunately.
[optimistically] Actually, Mr. Morrison, I can help expedite this. [speaking faster] If you can email those documents within the next hour, I'll personally walk them to underwriting. [firmly] We offer priority processing for time-sensitive closings.
[reassuringly] No additional charge for members in your situation, sir. [briskly] Just need the updated pay stubs from the last sixty days and a letter from HR confirming your position. [more warmly] I'll stay on to confirm receipt.
[efficiently] Use loans-urgent at riverside-c-u dot org—that comes straight to me. [quickly] Put your member number in the subject line, and I'll confirm within five minutes of receiving them. [encouragingly] We'll make this deadline work.
[professionally] That's what we're here for, Mr. Morrison. [speaking rapidly] Once I receive your documents, underwriting typically takes twenty-four hours for priority cases. [confidently] You should have your approval letter by Wednesday morning latest.
[firmly] I'll personally monitor your application through completion. [quickly] My direct extension is 4-5-2 if you need anything, and I'm here until six-thirty today. [more reassuringly] We've handled tighter deadlines than this successfully.
[briskly] And... perfect, just received them Mr. Morrison. [enthusiastically] Everything looks complete—I'm walking these to underwriting right now while we're still on the phone. Expect an update by tomorrow afternoon.
[Sad] I don't—I don't understand, you said the tests were just routine, right? [Slow] This can't be happening.
[Angry] No, no, you've gotta be looking at someone else's results because I feel completely fine! [Fast] Check again!
[Whisper] Um, should I... should I call my wife now or wait until I get home? [Sigh]
[Disappointed] [Slow] So all those years of eating kale and running marathons were just—what, pointless?
[Happy] Wait, you're joking, right? [Laugh] This is like one of those hidden camera things my kids watch!
[Fast] Okay so how long do I have to—actually, don't answer that yet, I need a minute. [Groan]
[Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect timing, really, 'cause I just booked a non-refundable cruise. [Tsk]
[Sad] My mom went through this same thing and she, um... [Whisper] she didn't make it.
[Shout] I want a second opinion! [Angry] I want three opinions, actually!
[Slow] Can you just, like, explain it again but use smaller words this time? [Disappointed] I'm kinda lost here.
[Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Sarcastic] I literally just paid off my student loans yesterday—thirty years of payments.
[Fast] [Whisper] Is this the kind of thing where I gotta quit my job or can I still work?
[Sad] I promised my daughter I'd walk her down the aisle and she's not even engaged yet. [Sigh]
[Angry] This is—no, I'm gonna sue somebody, the insurance company or whoever missed this! [Groan]
[Happy] Honestly? [Chuckle] Part of me is relieved 'cause at least now I know why I've been feeling so weird.
[Slow] [Disappointed] So basically you're telling me Christmas might be... different this year, huh?
[Whisper] I haven't even told my kids about the divorce yet and now there's—God, this is too much. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, sure, let's just pile it all on at once, why not throw in a meteor strike while we're at it?
[Sad] But Doctor, I just turned thirty, I mean, this isn't supposed to happen to people like—to people my age. [Slow]
[Shout] Don't touch me! [Angry] [Fast] I need to get out of here, I can't breathe in this stupid little room!
SCENARIO: Lightheartedly talking about unfollowing someone, then checking if they noticed, then seeing they've unfollowed back and subtweeted about it, ending in social media regret
Oh god. Oh no no no. I—okay, I can explain. I was having coffee with her and she was worried about you and I just—I accidentally mentioned it without thinking.
I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But we were talking about stress and work and she was saying how concerned she was and it just... slipped out. [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever.
You're right. You're completely right and I—there's no excuse. I broke your trust and that's... that's not okay. I shouldn't have said anything no matter what.
I know you did. And I—honestly, I've been feeling sick about it since it happened. Like, the second the words left my mouth I wanted to take them back. I tried to kinda backtrack but she'd already heard and—that doesn't matter. I messed up.
No! No, absolutely not. This was—I swear this was a one-time stupid mistake. [nervous laugh] I mean, not that that makes it better. But I don't go around sharing your stuff, I promise.
That's... that's fair. I don't—I guess you can't right now, can you? Um, all I can say is that I've never done this before and I'll never, ever do it again. Your mom just caught me off guard and I wasn't thinking.
Oh jesus. That's—ugh, I'm so sorry. Do you want me to talk to her? Like, I could tell her I was wrong or—actually no, that's probably a terrible idea. I just wanna fix this somehow.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. [sigh] I just... I hate that I did this to you. You trusted me with something personal and I—I completely blew it. I understand if you don't wanna talk to me for a while.
I know. And I made it weird with literally the worst possible person—your mom. That's... god, I'm such an idiot. You needed that safe space and I just—I ruined it. I'm really, really sorry.
That's okay. Take—take whatever time you need, alright? I'm gonna... I'm gonna be here when you're ready. And I promise—like really promise—nothing like this will ever happen again. I learned my lesson, believe me.
I know, I know, okay? I've been—look, I've been going through some stuff and I just... I didn't wanna drag you into it. That's not me being a bad friend, that's me trying to protect you from my mess.
It wasn't—I didn't disappear, I just needed space. And honestly? You're kinda proving why I didn't reach out. Like, I'm barely keeping it together and now I gotta defend myself for not being social enough? [scoff] That's exactly what I was trying to avoid.
Well I'm—I'm sorry you worried, but I posted on Instagram like, last week. You knew I was alive. I just wasn't ready to talk to anyone and that's... that's allowed, y'know?
What was I supposed to say? "Hey, I'm too depressed to function but don't worry about it"? That's—come on, that's not how it works. Sometimes you can't explain what's going on until you're through it. [sigh] I'm still not through it, honestly.
No, that's not—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I get that you're hurt, okay? But I literally couldn't handle talking to anyone. It wasn't personal, it wasn't about you.
Yeah well, imagine how it feels knowing your best friend is mad at you for having depression. Like—I'm sorry I couldn't perform friendship correctly while my brain was basically attacking me. Really sorry about that inconvenience.
Do what? Point out that you're making my mental health about you? Because that's—that's kinda what's happening here. [frustrated laugh] I needed help, not another person to disappoint.
Because I couldn't! I couldn't even shower some days, you think I had the energy to explain what was wrong? I'm barely explaining it now and you're already—whatever, you're already upset with me anyway.
Would you though? Because right now it seems like you don't. You're acting like I chose this, like I wanted to push everyone away. Nobody—nobody wants to feel like this, trust me.
I'm not okay. I'm really not. But I'm trying, and I thought—I dunno, I thought when I finally did reach out, you'd be glad to hear from me, not... this. Guess I waited too long.
SCENARIO: deciding whether an email sounds too passive aggressive
[gruff] Oh. You're Rachel's kid. [clearing throat] She said you'd be here but I thought— [trailing off] Look, I'm just grabbing my jacket, alright? Your mom and I have reservations at seven.
[defensive] Grumpy? [short laugh] That's rich. [mumbling] I prefer realistic. Kid, life isn't all rainbows and— [pause] Whatever. Where'd your mother go anyway? We're going to be late.
[strained] That's my daughter, Emma. [quieter] She lives with her mother now. [bitter chuckle] And no, she's more into soccer these days. [sigh] Unicorns are apparently too babyish for twelve-year-olds.
[uncomfortable grunt] It's complicated, alright? [gentler] Emma has her own schedule with— [sharp exhale] Look, you seem nice, but this isn't really something I discuss with... [pause] How old are you anyway?
[surprised] You want to learn about cars? [warming slightly] Well, that's... different. [thoughtful hum] Most kids your age just want screens. [clearer] Maybe I could show you something simple, like checking oil.
[amused snort] When you actually want to, huh? [more serious] Sounds familiar. Emma was the same way. [nostalgic sigh] Fine, Saturday morning, but only if your mom agrees. And wear old clothes.
[awkward pause] Dave's fine, kid. [muttering] Mr. Peterson is my father. [louder, resigned] Or my ex-father-in-law, technically. [dry laugh] Just Dave. Keep it simple, less complicated that way, trust me.
[embarrassed cough] That's... [softer] that's nice to know. [nervous chuckle] Don't tell her you told me that though, alright? [more firmly] Sometimes adults like to keep certain things to themselves, understand?
[mortified] You saw that?! [defeated groan] Christ, I mean— crud. [flustered] That was just... I was checking if I had food in my teeth, obviously. [mumbling quickly] Very important dental hygiene stuff.
[long exhale] You're something else, you know that? [gentler tone] Reminds me of Emma at that age. [quiet admission] Always calling me out on my nonsense. [regular volume] Fine, I'll work on the smiling thing.
[professionally] I'm sorry to hear about the damage, sir. [sympathetic] Let me pull up your account—847-B-2319, correct? [typing tone] I see you're at 4521 Oakwood Drive, and yes, we did have an outage in your area between 11:30 PM and 2:15 AM.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Henderson. [calmly] According to our records, an automated message was sent at 10:47 PM to all affected customers. [hesitant] Did you perhaps not receive notification code MSG-78294-X on your registered phone?
[reassuring] Your loyalty is absolutely valued, sir, and I want to help resolve this. [measured tone] For surge-related claims, you'll need to file form SC-1147 within 30 days. [helpfully] I can email that to you right now, or would you prefer receiving it by mail?
[carefully] Each claim is evaluated individually based on the circumstances. [more quietly] Between us though, if you have receipts and the items were less than 5 years old... [professionally again] The review process typically takes 10-15 business days after we receive your completed documentation.
[concerned] Oh, that's a medical necessity situation. [urgently] Let me transfer you immediately to our Priority Services at extension 4412. [warmly] They can expedite everything and possibly provide same-day temporary equipment—please hold while I connect you directly to supervisor Martinez.
[cheerfully] Hello, thanks for contacting ParkEZ support! [quickly] I see you're reaching out about a meter issue. [more gently] Could you tell me what's happening—are you having trouble starting your session?
[apologetically] Oh, I understand how frustrating that must be. [briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick—what's the meter number you're trying to use? [reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out right away.
[quickly] I'm checking meter 4782 now, and—hmm—it looks like there might be a sync issue. [more slowly] Sometimes the meter needs a hard reset. [helpfully] Have you tried entering your plate without any spaces or dashes?
[sympathetically] I completely understand your urgency, really. [more quickly] Here's what I can do—I'm manually activating a two-hour session for you right now. [efficiently] You should see the confirmation in about... fifteen seconds.
[warmly] Job interview—oh wow, good luck with that! [chuckles softly] I've also added a credit to your account for the inconvenience. [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with before you run?
[Soft] Hey, um, I know we don't know each other, but are you—are you okay? [Sad] Do you need someone to just, like, sit here with you?
[Fast] I've got tissues in my bag somewhere, hold on, let me just— [Chuckle] I'm basically a walking pharmacy, my mom always said I overpack.
[Whisper] You don't have to talk about it if you don't wanna, okay? [Sigh] Sometimes it just helps to not be alone.
[Happy] My therapist says crying is, like, literally the body's way of healing itself, so you're actually doing great right now! [Laugh]
[Slow] Whatever happened, it's gonna— [Tsk] I mean, I know everyone says that, but things really do get easier.
[Disappointed] God, people can be so cruel sometimes, can't they? [Sad] I'm sorry you're going through this, whatever it is.
[Sarcastic] Well, this bench has definitely seen worse days than yours, trust me. [Chuckle] I once saw a guy propose here and get rejected, so...
[Angry] Hey, did someone hurt you? [Fast] 'Cause I will absolutely go have words with them right now if you need me to.
[Sad] I remember crying in public once and this stranger bought me coffee, so, um— [Soft] Can I get you something from that café over there?
[Shout] You know what? [Happy] Screw whoever made you feel this way—you deserve so much better than this!
[Whisper] It's okay to just let it all out, honestly. [Sigh] [Slow] I'm not going anywhere unless you want me to.
[Fast] Oh god, I'm being weird, aren't I? [Laugh] I just saw you and I couldn't just walk by without—sorry, I'll leave if you want.
[Disappointed] The world kinda sucks right now, doesn't it? [Tsk] But hey, at least we've got, um, nice weather today?
[Slow] You're being really brave, you know? [Sad] Most people would've just gone home, but you're here, dealing with it.
[Sarcastic] I mean, if it helps, my day's been absolute garbage too. [Groan] We can form a little pity party right here.
[Happy] Actually, there's this breathing technique that's supposed to— [Fast] Wait, sorry, you probably don't want advice right now, never mind.
[Angry] [Shout] Nobody should have to feel this alone! [Soft] Look, I'm a complete stranger but I actually give a damn, okay?
[Whisper] Do you want me to call someone for you? [Sad] Like, a friend or family member who could—I dunno, just thinking out loud.
[Chuckle] This is gonna sound stupid, but my grandma always said tears water the flowers of tomorrow or something. [Sigh] She was better at this stuff than me.
[Slow] Hey, I gotta catch my train soon, but— [Disappointed] I really hope things get better for you, like, genuinely.
SCENARIO: Lightly joking about a tab they've had open forever, then checking what it is, then realizing it was something urgent they meant to do, ending in procrastination guilt
I—okay, I know you're mad, but it literally just came up. We were all talking about work stuff and Jake mentioned his interview at the same company and I just—it slipped out, alright?
Yes! It slipped out! I didn't wake up planning to tell everyone about your—about what happened. They were all sharing their worst interview stories and I mentioned yours without thinking. [Sigh] I realize now that wasn't cool, but...
But you're acting like I maliciously went around gossiping about you, which is—that's not what happened. At all. I mean, come on, we've been friends for how long? You really think I'd do that to you?
No, I—ugh, that's not the same thing and you know it. There's a difference between accidentally mentioning something in conversation and like, deliberately spreading your business around. I'm not saying I handled it perfectly, but [frustrated laugh] you're being kinda unfair here.
Okay okay, look—I get that sucks. I do. But once it was out there, what was I supposed to do? Tell everyone to forget I said it? That would've just made it into a bigger thing, y'know?
Yeah, well, I can't—I can't go back in time, can I? I messed up, fine, but honestly? You've shared stuff about me before too. Remember when you told Amy about my breakup while it was still happening?
How? How is that different? Because—no, seriously, explain to me how that's different. You "accidentally" told her I got dumped at my birthday dinner, and I had to deal with her pity texts for weeks.
That's not—[groan] I'm not trying to keep score here. I'm just saying maybe you could cut me some slack since I've literally never done this before and it wasn't on purpose.
I mean, it kinda does though? Like, intent matters. I wasn't trying to hurt you or—or make you look bad. Everyone was bonding over their failures and I thought... I dunno, I thought it would help normalize it or something.
You know what? Fine. Be mad. But I'm kinda disappointed that after everything, you can't even—whatever. I said I'm sorry, I explained what happened. If you wanna stay pissed at me forever over one mistake, that's... that's on you.
Wait wait wait—that's not what happened. I was talking about my own shit, okay? Like, I was literally explaining why I've been so anxious lately and yeah, I mentioned that we both go to therapy but—
I didn't share your stuff though! I was talking about me, about how I've been struggling with the same things. You're making it sound like I just [scoff] randomly brought up your personal business, which isn't what happened at all.
That's—okay, that's not fair. I needed to talk to someone too, y'know? And I thought—I dunno, I thought mentioning we were both working through stuff would make it less... weird or whatever. I wasn't gossiping about you.
Yeah, maybe. But honestly? It's kinda hard when we've been going through this together. Like, you're acting like I betrayed you when I was literally just trying to explain my own situation. [frustrated laugh] I mean, come on.
So what? Seriously, so what? Half our friend group is in therapy—it's not like it's this big shameful secret. And I'm sorry if you wanted to keep it private, I am, but you're treating me like I'm some kind of—like I did this to hurt you.
Actually, yeah, it kinda does matter? Like, there's a difference between me maliciously spreading your business and me mentioning—in passing—while talking about my own mental health, that we both see therapists. That's—those are two completely different things.
Okay okay, fine. I get that you're upset. But I'm also—look, I'm disappointed too, alright? Because I thought you'd understand that I wasn't trying to violate your trust. I was having a really shit day and I needed to vent.
That's not—[sigh] I didn't throw you under anything. You're being so dramatic about this. I literally said "yeah, we both started going around the same time" and that was it. I didn't share what you talk about or why you go or—nothing like that.
Maybe not. Fine. But you know what? You're not being a great friend right now either. Like, you haven't even asked why I was upset enough to need to talk to Marcus in the first place. It's just all about you and how I wronged you.
Yeah, well—I'm sorry it came out, okay? I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna apologize for needing support too. And honestly? If you can't see the difference between what I did and actually betraying you, then I dunno what to tell you.
That's not—I never said it like that. I'm trying to help you move forward, okay? There's a difference between minimizing and, like, trying to help you not stay stuck in this forever.
No, it's really not though. Look look, I've been listening to you talk about this for months—which I'm happy to do—but at some point, y'know, dwelling on it isn't helping anymore. [frustrated laugh] That's all I'm saying.
I didn't—come on, don't twist my words. I'm just saying maybe it's time to, I dunno, try something different? Because what you're doing now obviously isn't working.
Okay okay, see, this is what I mean. I literally can't say anything without you getting—I'm trying here. I am. But you're acting like I'm the bad guy for suggesting you might wanna, like, actually heal from this.
I'm not deciding anything! Jesus. I'm just—[sigh]—I'm worried about you, alright? And honestly, it feels like you want to stay angry more than you want to feel better.
What? What's "wow"? You're gonna sit there and tell me you haven't been, like, holding onto this? Fine fine, maybe I shouldn't have said it that way, but somebody needs to.
Then how? Seriously, tell me how I'm supposed to—because I've tried being supportive, I've tried just listening, and now when I suggest maybe trying to move forward, suddenly I'm the worst friend ever?
No, but you—okay, you're right, you didn't. But I'm also allowed to have opinions about watching my best friend basically torture themselves over something that happened six months ago. That's—is that not fair?
For some things, sure. But you're not even trying to—[groan] whatever. You know what? Maybe I am minimizing. Maybe I just don't get it. But I'm also kinda tired of feeling like the bad guy for wanting you to be okay.
Stop what? Stop caring? Stop trying to help? I mean—that's what you want? Because honestly, I dunno what else to do here. I'm sorry if I'm not saying the right things, but I'm not gonna pretend like watching you do this to yourself is easy either.
SCENARIO: trying to decide which snack to get from the vending machine
[exasperated] Sweetie, we need to talk about your appearance. [getting louder] The Hendersons are coming for dinner tonight, and you look like you just [pause] [disgusted] rolled out of bed. Could you at least brush your hair?
[high-pitched] Effortless? [incredulous laugh] You look homeless! [whispering urgently] What will they think of our family? Their daughter just got into Yale—she always looks immaculate. Please, just change into something presentable for once.
[hurt tone] Important stuff? [voice breaking] Our reputation IS important! [faster words] I work so hard to maintain our image in this neighborhood, and you're sabotaging everything with your deliberate sloppiness. It's embarrassing!
[defensive shout] That's not true! [quieter] Mrs. Peterson mentioned your appearance at book club last week. [trembling] She said—and I quote—"Your daughter certainly marches to her own drummer." [bitter laugh] Do you know how humiliating that was?
[pleading] Just this once, honey. [softer] Wear the blue dress I bought you—the one with the flowers? [desperately quick] It would mean so much to me. You looked absolutely stunning in it at Easter!
[sarcastic whisper] Jeans without holes, how generous. [building frustration] You know what? When you're thirty and wondering why you never learned proper presentation, [sharp exhale] don't come crying to me about missed opportunities!
[mocking] Steve Jobs? [exasperated groan] You're not building Apple in our garage! [quieter, sadder] I just want you to understand that first impressions matter, sweetheart. The world judges us whether we like it or not.
[defeated] Your own skin. [long sigh] That's all your generation talks about—authenticity, being yourself. [wistful] When I was your age, we understood the value of putting our best foot forward, of trying.
[sudden outburst] Fine! [voice cracking] Wear whatever you want! [more quietly] When the Hendersons whisper about our "alternative" child, I'll just smile and pretend it doesn't slice through me like a knife.
[brightening immediately] Really? You'll wear it? [excited squeal] Oh honey, thank you! [rapidly] You won't regret this—Mrs. Henderson always brings those fancy chocolates, and she's more generous when she's impressed!
[apologetic] Sir, I understand you're upset, and I'm truly sorry this happened. [calmly] Let me pull up your file... R-7834-B, yes, I see it here. [concerned] According to our records, you signed a data waiver form at drop-off.
[defensive] Sir, our standard protocol requires all customers to back up their data before any repair. [more firmly] The form clearly states in section 4-A that we're not responsible for data loss. [sighs] Did you create a backup before bringing it in?
[skeptical] Employee 4492... that's Marcus, he wouldn't have promised that. [matter-of-factly] Our policy at 1247 Riverside Plaza has been the same for three years. [professionally] However, I can offer you a $50 store credit for your inconvenience.
[sympathetically] I genuinely wish there was something more I could do. [hesitant] Let me... let me speak with my manager, Mr. Chen. [more hopefully] Sometimes our advanced tech team can attempt recovery for a fee of $299.
[pleading] Sir, please, let's not escalate this further. [quickly] Actually, wait—I'm seeing here that your device serial J7K9-XX2M might still have a cloud backup from October 14th. [relieved sigh] Can you check your account settings right now?
[professional] Thank you for reaching out, Mr. Henderson. [quickly] I understand you have concerns about your case timeline—let me pull up your file right away. [reassuring] We're here to address any issues you're experiencing.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, and you're right to be concerned. [more quickly] The discovery phase has taken longer than anticipated due to, uh, opposing counsel requesting multiple extensions. [firmly] However, we should have depositions scheduled within two weeks.
[calmly] You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the lack of consistent updates. [briskly] Moving forward, we'll implement weekly email briefings every Friday, even if it's just to say nothing has changed. [sincerely] Your case is a priority.
[more firmly] Let me be specific then—depositions are scheduled for March 15th and 17th. [quickly] The motion hearing is set for April 2nd, and barring any unforeseen circumstances, we should have resolution by May. [confidently] These dates are confirmed.
[reassuring] Fair point, and I understand your skepticism. [more briskly] Unforeseen would be things like judge illness or, uh, natural disasters—not routine scheduling conflicts. [emphatically] We've already blocked these dates and notified all parties, so they're locked in.
[quickly] Let me address that immediately—there seems to be a disconnect between our billing and case management systems. [apologetically] The research was completed on time, but the communication about it wasn't properly logged. [firmly] I'll have accounting review and adjust that invoice today.
[sympathetically] I completely understand, and you deserve better service than what you've received. [briskly] Here's what I propose—a 15% discount on this month's billing, plus those weekly updates I mentioned. [confidently] We want to rebuild your trust.
[decisively] You're absolutely right, and effective immediately, I'm your single point of contact. [quickly] My direct line is 555-0147, and I personally oversee every aspect of your case from here out. [earnestly] No more transfers, no more confusion.
[firmly] Absolutely, and in fact, we're filing a motion to compel tomorrow morning. [more quickly] Their delay tactics end now—the judge has already indicated frustration with their behavior. [confidently] We're taking a much more aggressive stance moving forward.
[candidly] Your feedback did, actually—leadership reviewed your case this morning. [briskly] They agreed we've been too accommodating, and frankly, it's hurt your position. [determinedly] That stops today, and we're pushing hard for that May resolution.
[Disappointed] I know I bought it here, I just—I can't find the stupid receipt anywhere, but like, can't you look it up? [Sigh]
[Fast] Okay so basically my dog ate the receipt—no really, I'm serious—and I need to return this because it's broken. [Nervous laugh]
[Sarcastic] Oh great, so you're telling me that without that tiny piece of paper, this is just, what, mine forever? [Tsk]
[Whisper] Between you and me, um, my wife doesn't know I bought this, so I kinda need to—you know. [Slow]
[Happy] You guys have the best return policy though, right? [Laugh] I shop here literally all the time!
[Angry] This is ridiculous—I mean, you can see the price tag's still on it! [Shout] Manager! I need a manager!
[Slow] Look, I'm not trying to scam anyone here, I just, uh, I honestly forgot to keep the receipt. [Sad]
[Fast] Can you maybe check my credit card history or something 'cause I definitely—wait, did I pay cash? [Groan]
[Disappointed] I drove forty-five minutes to get here and now you're gonna—really? [Tsk] This is how you treat customers?
[Sarcastic] Sure, I'll just keep this broken blender that I totally wanted to own forever. [Slow] That's exactly what I had planned. [Sigh]
[Whisper] Is there, like, someone else I could talk to who might be more, um, flexible about this? [Chuckle]
[Happy] Wait wait wait, I think I might have—no, that's a grocery receipt, sorry. [Fast] But I swear I bought it Tuesday!
[Sad] My kid threw it away when he was "helping" clean, and I just—I dunno what else to tell you. [Slow]
[Angry] Every other store does store credit at least! [Fast] This is basically theft at this point, you realize that, right?
[Chuckle] Would it help if I, uh, if I showed you the charge on my bank app? [Happy] See? Seventy-nine ninety-nine!
[Disappointed] So you're saying even though it's literally defective, there's nothing—absolutely nothing—you can do? [Groan]
[Slow] I mean, honestly, I probably spent like three thousand dollars here last year, so... [Sarcastic] But sure, this one time matters. [Tsk]
[Shout] It's still in the original packaging! [Angry] How is this not proof enough that I'm not trying to pull something here?
[Whisper] Look, I'm kinda desperate here—it was supposed to be a gift and it's the wrong size. [Sad] Please?
[Fast] Okay so what if—hear me out—what if I buy something else right now and then return both things together? [Laugh] [Happy]
SCENARIO: Calmly recounting a boundary they set with someone, then remembering their exact words, then hearing how harsh it sounds out loud, ending in relationship guilt
I—okay, yeah, but it's not what you think. I only showed it to Jordan because they were literally going through the exact same thing and I thought—I dunno, I thought it might help them.
Look, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I posted it online or something. It was one person—one—who doesn't even know you. [Sigh] And honestly? They really needed to hear it.
Okay okay, but come on, it's not like I shared anything super personal. It was just the part where you were talking about dealing with anxiety at work—that's it. I cropped out everything else.
Fine, you're right, technically—but can you maybe understand why I did it? Jordan was having a literal breakdown and your words were—they were perfect. [frustrated laugh] I was trying to help someone.
That's—wow, okay, "violating" is a pretty strong word for showing one screenshot to help someone who was crying in my apartment. But sure, make me the villain here.
Yeah, I could've, you're right. But it was like 2 AM and Jordan was—whatever, you don't wanna hear it. I'm sorry I didn't ask, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I was trying to do something good.
I mean, they should count for something though, right? Like, there's a difference between me being careless with your privacy and me deliberately—[Groan] you know what, forget it. You've already decided I'm terrible.
Oh great, disappointed is so much better. Look look, I messed up, I get it. But you're being really—I dunno, rigid about this? Like we've been friends for how long and this is gonna be the thing?
And I respect that, I do, but—okay, honestly? You've shared stuff about me before too. Remember when you told Kyle about my thing with my ex? Without asking? But I didn't make it into this whole production.
Is it though? Is it really? Because from where I'm sitting, we both shared something to help someone else, except I'm the only one getting crucified for it. [Scoff] But yeah, sure, totally different.
SCENARIO: waiting for the microwave while hungry
[sternly] You cannot go to this party with that boy. [voice rising] I don't know his family, his background—nothing! [Sharp exhale] What will people say when they see you alone with him at night?
[incredulous] Other parents? [scoffing] Other parents don't care what happens to their children! [more firmly] We came to this country to give you opportunities, not to watch you throw away your reputation for some boy.
[proudly] Good! Dating is distraction. [quieter] When I was your age, I was studying every night, helping my mother with housework. [accusingly] Now you want to waste time on romance instead of focusing on college applications?
[dismissively] This is living? [bitter laugh] Running around with boys who will forget you next week? [slower pace] In our culture, we date with purpose, with family involvement. Not this American nonsense of "having fun."
[shocked whisper] How can you say that? [emotionally] Everything we do is for you! [voice trembling] But you're forgetting where you come from, becoming like these kids with no respect for family values.
[softer tone] You belong with us, with family. [hesitant] This boy... what does he know about our struggles, our sacrifices? [firmly] American boys, they don't understand commitment. They don't understand real responsibility.
[surprised] He's learning our language? [suspicious] Why didn't you tell me this before? [quick exhale] Still, words are easy. Actions matter more. What are his intentions with you?
[long sigh] Winter formal... [contemplating] With chaperones? [more sternly] And you come home by ten-thirty, no later. I will pick you up myself, and I want to meet this boy first.
[warning tone] This is not permission for dating. [clearer] This is one event, one time. [nervous chuckle] And your aunt will probably have my head when she hears about this decision.
[reluctantly amused] Every hour is too much. [gentler] Every two hours. [deep breath] Maybe I am too strict sometimes, but it's because this world... it's not always kind to young girls, especially our girls.
[firmly] Dr. Martinez, I need to discuss a serious breach of professional boundaries involving my therapist, Dr. Sarah Chen—license number 47B-2019. [pause] She friended me on Facebook last Tuesday, May 14th, and [voice rising] has been commenting on all my personal posts.
[frustrated] It started innocently enough with a friend request around 9:30 PM, but then—[sighs heavily]—she liked seventeen photos from my 2018 vacation. [incredulous] She even commented "Looking great!" on my beach photos, which felt... invasive.
[hesitant] Well, during our last three sessions she kept mentioning her divorce proceedings. [voice breaking] She spent maybe 20 minutes—20 minutes!—of my $175 session talking about her ex-husband Gary. [sarcastically] Really therapeutic for ME, you know?
[defensively] I blocked her immediately after she sent me a private message at 11:47 PM asking if I wanted to grab coffee! [groans] My anxiety is through the roof—isn't she supposed to be helping with that?
[upset] Honestly? I feel betrayed and—[voice shaking]—I don't know if I can trust another therapist here. [bitterly] I've been coming to this clinic since 2021, and now I'm considering filing with the state board, license complaint form 45-C.
[skeptically] How do I know this won't happen again with therapist number—what would this be—four? [sighs] I specifically requested someone experienced when I filled out intake form 12-B, and look where that got me.
[considering] Dr. Wong... I've heard good things about him from the support group that meets Wednesdays. [cautiously hopeful] If you're personally guaranteeing oversight with your supervisor license—SV-8823, right?—then maybe I'll give it one more try.
[relieved] Thank you for taking this seriously, unlike the office manager who said I was "overreacting" yesterday. [more firmly] I want everything documented though—every incident from May 14th through today, May 21st.
[tired] Employee 10847—Rebecca something—she practically rolled her eyes at me. [sighs deeply] I just want to feel safe in therapy again, you know? [quietly] Is that too much to ask for my mental health investment?
[gratefully] I appreciate you listening and actually doing something about this mess. [pause] [cautiously] Will Dr. Chen still have access to my files—all those notes from our 23 sessions?
[briskly] Thank you for calling Extended Shield Warranty Services, how can I— [pause] yes, I see your claim here. [more quickly] Unfortunately, your transmission failure isn't covered under your basic powertrain plan.
[apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, really, but [speaking faster] the CVT transmission in your vehicle falls under a different category— [clears throat] it's specifically excluded on page forty-seven of your contract.
[defensively] It's not useless, sir, it covers many components like— [quickly rattling off] water pumps, alternators, starter motors. [more firmly] Just not continuously variable transmissions manufactured after 2018.
[mechanically] I can transfer you to our retention department who might— [speeding up] they sometimes have upgrade options available. [sighs] Though I should mention there's a ninety-day waiting period for pre-existing issues.
[offended] Sir, I don't work from a script, I'm trying to— [more quickly] Look, let me check with my supervisor. [hesitantly] Sometimes we can file an exception for long-term customers.
[hurriedly] The supervisor says we can offer a one-time courtesy credit of— [pause] five hundred dollars toward your repair. [apologetically] It's not full coverage, but it's something we don't normally do.
[sympathetically] I really wish I could do more, but— [speaking quickly] the underwriters set these limits, not me. [sighs heavily] Have you considered our platinum plan for future coverage?
[defensively] That's not what I— [pause] [more calmly] Sir, I'm documenting everything in your file for the review board. Sometimes they overturn initial decisions within five business days.
[quickly] I'll email those forms right now, and— [more enthusiastically] actually, I just noticed you might qualify for our hardship provision. [cautiously] It requires additional documentation though.
[rapidly] Three months of bank statements, two repair estimates, and— [pause] [apologetically] a notarized affidavit stating this failure impacts your ability to work. [more hopefully] But it could increase coverage to seventy percent.
[Disappointed] Yeah, I get it, Sarah's the smart one—I've only heard that, like, a thousand times before. [Sigh]
[Angry] [Fast] Stop, just stop comparing us, okay? We're different people with different—God, why do I even bother explaining this anymore?
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, another story about my brother's promotion, how refreshing and not at all predictable. [Tsk]
[Sad] [Slow] I mean, I try so hard, but it's never... it's just never enough, you know?
