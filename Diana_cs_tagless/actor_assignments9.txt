Character 1: So. It's official. Got the letter yesterday.

748 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what letter? What's official? Oh my god, is this—is this what I think it is?

Character 1: Citizenship. They approved it.

749 Character 2: SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up! Are you—oh my god, are you serious right now? [Gasp] This is huge! This is like, this is literally everything!

Character 1: Yeah. Took seven years.

750 Character 2: Seven—okay, that's actually insane. Like, seven years of just... waiting and paperwork and probably, I dunno, stress eating? How are you so calm about this?

Character 1: Haven't really processed it yet.

751 Character 2: No no no, I get that. It's probably like—honestly? It probably doesn't even feel real yet, right? When's the ceremony thing?

Character 1: Three weeks. Have to memorize an oath.

752 Character 2: An oath! That's so—wait, that's kinda intense actually. [Chuckle] Like what, you gotta pledge allegiance and stuff? Is it long?

Character 1: It's fine. My parents are flying in.

753 Character 2: Oh wow, they're—that's amazing! They must be like, completely losing their minds proud right now. Your mom's probably already told everyone she knows.

Character 1: She cried. On FaceTime. For twenty minutes.

754 Character 2: Okay that's—that's actually really sweet though. I mean, twenty minutes is [Laugh] a lot, but like... this is everything they wanted for you, y'know?

Character 1: I guess. Feel weird about the whole thing.

755 Character 2: Weird how? Like—wait, are you nervous about it or is it more like... I dunno, complicated feelings about the whole citizenship thing?

Character 1: Both. Neither. Don't know.

756 Character 2: That's—honestly that makes total sense. It's like, you're gaining something but also kinda... not losing, but changing something? About who you are? That's gotta be heavy.

Character 1: Yeah. Exactly that.

757 Character 2: Well hey, for what it's worth? I'm like—I'm really, really proud of you. Seven years is... [Sigh] that's a long time to fight for something. You did it though.

Script: af406eae_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about the jokes.

758 Character 2: Oh—oh no, what jokes? Wait, do you mean the thing from yesterday? Because I was just trying to be funny and—actually, that's not an excuse, I shouldn't have—

Character 1: You know exactly what jokes.

759 Character 2: The height thing. Right. God, I'm—I'm such an idiot. [nervous laugh] I didn't think it was bothering you that much because you were laughing too, y'know? But that's—that's not really an excuse either.

Character 1: I wasn't laughing. I was uncomfortable.

760 Character 2: You weren't—oh. Oh shit. I thought... okay no, you're right, I should've noticed. I just get carried away sometimes when everyone's joking around and I don't—I don't always think before I speak.

Character 1: It's not just the height jokes.

761 Character 2: Wait wait wait, there's more? What else did I—oh god, the thing about your voice? When you were presenting? I meant it as like a lighthearted—but that's terrible, isn't it? I'm literally the worst friend. [groan]

Character 1: Every time. In front of everyone.

762 Character 2: I know, I know. You're right. It's like—it's become this stupid habit and I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time? But that's my problem, not yours, and I shouldn't be making you feel bad about yourself. That's so messed up.

Character 1: Do you think I'm that pathetic? That I'm just an easy target?

763 Character 2: No! No no no, absolutely not! I think you're—you're amazing, honestly. I think I just... sometimes when I'm nervous or trying to be funny, I go for the easy joke? And I pick on people I'm comfortable with, which is so backwards and stupid—

Character 1: So you're comfortable hurting me.

764 Character 2: That's not—okay, yeah, hearing it like that... [sigh] That sounds awful. I meant comfortable like I feel close to you, but I'm using that closeness in completely the wrong way. Like, I would never make those jokes about someone I didn't know well, which makes this worse, doesn't it?

Character 1: Yeah. It does.

765 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm gonna stop. Completely. No more jokes about anything personal, I swear. And if I slip up, you can literally just tell me to shut up, okay? I mean it. I don't wanna be that person who makes their friends feel shitty about themselves.

Character 1: You really didn't know it bothered me?

766 Character 2: I mean... maybe part of me kinda knew? Like, looking back, you did get quiet sometimes. But I just—I dunno, I convinced myself it was fine because we're friends and friends tease each other, right? But there's teasing and then there's being an actual jerk, and I crossed that line.

Character 1: Multiple times. But... I should've said something sooner.

767 Character 2: No, don't—you shouldn't have to tell me not to be mean about your insecurities. That's like, basic friendship stuff. But I'm really, really glad you're telling me now. And I'm sorry it took you having to confront me about it. I wanna do better. I will do better.

Script: 78819a4e_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Got the call today. I'm approved.

768 Character 2: Wait wait wait—approved? Like, approved approved? Oh my god, you're gonna be a foster parent! This is—I mean, how are you even feeling right now?

Character 1: Terrified.

769 Character 2: Oh honey, yeah, no that's—that's totally normal though. Like, you're literally about to change a kid's whole life, y'know? When do they, um, when do they place someone with you?

Character 1: Could be next week. Could be three months.

770 Character 2: That's so—okay that's kinda wild actually. Like you just... wait? By the phone? [Nervous laugh] God, I'd be going absolutely insane not knowing.

Character 1: Yeah. I've been cleaning the spare room obsessively.

771 Character 2: Stop, that's actually—that's really sweet though. You're already being such a parent! Have you like, bought stuff? Or do you wait until you know their age and everything?

Character 1: Some basics. Bedding. Towels. I don't know what else.

772 Character 2: Right right, because you don't—I mean, could be a five-year-old, could be a teenager... [Sigh] This is huge. Like, this is what you've wanted for so long.

Character 1: Three years of paperwork and classes.

773 Character 2: Three years, jesus. And all those home visits and background checks and—ugh, I remember when they interviewed ME about you. I was so nervous I'd say something wrong.

Character 1: You cried during it.

774 Character 2: I did not—okay fine, maybe a little! But like, they asked why you'd be a good parent and I just... started thinking about how much you've wanted this, y'know?

Character 1: I might mess this up.

775 Character 2: No no no, don't—don't even go there. You're gonna be incredible. These kids, they need someone stable, someone who actually gives a damn. That's literally you.

Character 1: What if they hate me?

776 Character 2: Then you just... keep showing up anyway? [Soft chuckle] That's kinda the whole thing, right? Being there even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard, actually.

Character 1: I bought a night light. Just in case.

777 Character 2: See? That's—oh my god, that's exactly what I mean. You're already thinking about making them feel safe. You're gonna be so, so good at this.

778 SCENARIO: discovering the parking meter only takes coins

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I just need to, um— I need to put some money in this thing and then I can— [sigh] oh. Oh, it's one of those old ones. The, uh, the coin ones.

[slightly annoyed]

Right, because of course it is. Of course I find the one parking meter in the entire city that doesn't take, um, that doesn't take cards or— or whatever. Just coins. Like it's 1987 or something.

[rummaging tone]

Okay, let me just— let me check my, uh, my wallet here. Maybe I have some— some quarters? Do I ever have quarters? I feel like I never have quarters when I actually need them.

[frustrated but resigned]

Thirty-seven cents. I have thirty-seven cents in, um, in random change and I need— what do I need, like a dollar? A dollar fifty? This is— this is great. This is just great.

[brightening slightly]

Wait, actually, maybe— maybe there's a, uh, there's probably a store or something around here that can break a twenty? I mean, that's a thing, right? People still do that?

[trailing off, uncertain]

Unless I just... risk it? How often do they actually check these things anyway...

Script: 741af1aa | Role: Character 1 (A)

779 Character 1: [hesitant] I didn't think you'd come. [clearing throat] It's been what—seven years? [softer] Mom keeps asking for you though, even with the morphine, she mumbles your name between the beeps of these machines.

Character 2: [defensive] Don't start with me, Sarah. [bitter laugh] You're the one who said I wasn't welcome at Christmas anymore. [quieter] But I'm here now, aren't I? That has to count for something with her.

780 Character 1: [exhausted sigh] The doctors say maybe days. [trembling] Her liver's completely shot—all those years of drinking finally caught up. [accusatory] Where were you when I was cleaning up her vomit at three in the morning?

Character 2: [raised voice] Living my life! [more controlled] You chose to stay, to enable her. [long pause] I couldn't watch her destroy herself anymore, and you just kept making excuses, kept pretending everything was fine.

781 Character 1: [through tears] Someone had to take care of her. [sharper] You just ran away to California the second things got hard. [wavering] Dad would've been so disappointed seeing us like this, standing here arguing.

Character 2: [scoffing] Dad would've understood. [firmly] He told me to leave—did you know that? [whispered confession] Said I didn't need to drown with her, that one of us should escape this family's curse.

782 Character 1: [shocked whisper] He never said that. [building anger] You're making things up again, just like when we were kids. [broken voice] God, even now, even here, you're trying to rewrite history to make yourself feel better.

Character 2: [weary] Believe what you want. [gentle now] Look at her though—she seems peaceful. [thoughtful pause] Remember when she'd braid our hair before school? Before the bottles, before everything went to hell?

783 Character 1: [soft laugh] She'd make those elaborate French braids. [wistful] You always got the pink ribbons; I got blue. [cracking voice] I found a box of those ribbons last week while cleaning out her apartment.

Character 2: [barely audible] I still have mine. [stronger] Keep them in my jewelry box. [quick exhale] Maybe we should talk to her together, let her know we're both here, that we're okay.

784 Character 1: [sniffling] What would we even say? [sardonic] Hey Mom, your daughters finally stopped hating each other long enough to watch you die? [quieter] She probably can't even hear us through all the medications anyway.

Character 2: [determined] She can hear us. [insistent whisper] I read that hearing is the last thing to go. [emotional] Mom, it's Katie—Sarah's here too. We're both here with you now, together.

785 Character 1: [joining in] We love you, Mom. [steadier] And we forgive you—for all of it. [breath catching] The missed recitals, the forgotten birthdays, the promises you couldn't keep. We understand now that you were sick.

Character 2: [crying softly] Sarah, her hand—did you see? [amazed] She squeezed my fingers just now. [urgent whisper] Mom, if you can hear us, we're going to be okay. We'll take care of each other.

786 Character 1: [disbelief] Her eyes are fluttering. [louder] Mom? Mom, can you see us? [desperately hopeful] Both your girls are here, just like you wanted. Katie came all the way from San Francisco.

Character 2: [breathless] She's trying to speak. [leaning closer] What is it, Mom? [shaking voice] I can't—Sarah, can you understand what she's saying? Something about the house? About Dad's study?

787 Character 1: [recognition dawning] The letter. [faster] She kept saying something about a letter in Dad's desk. [confused] I thought she was just rambling, but maybe—Katie, what if there's something there?

Character 2: [skeptical] After all these years? [considering] Though she never let anyone in that room. [decided] We should check, after—[pause] after everything's over. Together, we should go together.

788 Character 1: [peaceful] Together sounds right. [warm tone] Maybe grab coffee first, catch up properly? [tentative hope] I have two kids now—twins. They have your stubborn streak, believe it or not.

Character 2: [surprised joy] Twins? [laughing through tears] Oh Sarah, that's beautiful. [sincere] I want to meet them, if you'll let me. [softly] Maybe we can salvage something from all this wreckage after all.

Script: b5c0079b | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, I'm calling to cancel my subscription—I've been trying to do this online for, uh, three days now. [sighs heavily] My account number is K47-B92-MM4, and [more firmly] I really need this done today.

789 Customer Support: Thank you for calling StreamPlus support, I understand your frustration. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account—K47-B92-MM4, correct? I see you've had some trouble with our website, and I'm sorry about that.

Character 1: [impatiently] Yes, that's the number, and honestly, I haven't used the service since, um, probably February? [getting louder] I'm still being charged $24.99 every month [exasperated], which is just throwing money away at this point.

790 Customer Support: I completely understand, and looking at your account here, you've been a member since 2021. Before we proceed with the cancellation, may I ask what specific issues led to this decision—was it the content, or perhaps the pricing?

Character 1: [sighs] Look, it's nothing personal, I just—the content isn't what it used to be, you know? [matter-of-factly] Plus, I've got like four other streaming services now, and [chuckles dryly] my credit card statement looks like a subscription nightmare every month.

791 Customer Support: That's totally understandable, subscription fatigue is real these days. What if I could offer you our lite plan for just $7.99 a month? [hopefully] That's a 68% discount, and you'd keep access to our core library.

Character 1: [skeptically] Seven ninety-nine? I mean... [pauses] no, no, I really need to cancel. [more decisively] My wife's been on my case about the 1847 Maple Street credit card bills, and [groans] this is one thing I can actually control here.

792 Customer Support: I respect your decision, absolutely, and I'll process that cancellation right away. Just to confirm, you want to cancel effective immediately? You'll lose access at the end of your current billing cycle on November 15th, 2024.

Character 1: [relieved] Yes, immediately, thank you—wait, November 15th? [confused] But if I'm canceling now, why do I still have access for... [calculating] three more weeks? [suspiciously] You're not still charging me, right?

793 Customer Support: No additional charges at all—you've already paid through November 15th, so you're just getting what you've paid for. I'm sending a confirmation email to your registered address, and your cancellation reference number is CX-20241024-7789B. Is there anything else I can help with today?

794 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is Mike from Precision Home Inspections returning your call. I understand you have some concerns about the inspection report we completed yesterday?

Character 1: [frustrated] Concerns? That's putting it mildly! [voice rising] Your report says there's extensive mold in the attic, but—but you never even went up there. [accusingly] How exactly did you inspect it from the ground?

795 Customer Support: Sir, I assure you I did access the attic through the pull-down stairs. [more firmly] The moisture readings were off the charts, and there were visible——dark stains on several rafters.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh really? Because the seller just sent me photos from this morning. [slower, emphatic] Pristine. White. Rafters. [exasperated sigh] Not a single stain anywhere, Mike.

796 Customer Support: Well, sometimes these issues aren't visible in photos, especially if—if taken with flash. Mold can hide behind insulation, and my thermal camera picked up significant temperature variations.

Character 1: [incredulous] Your thermal camera? [laughs bitterly] The seller's inspector came by an hour ago with actual lab results. [pause] [firmly] Zero mold spores, Mike. Zero.

797 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, truly. Perhaps we should schedule a reinspection—no charge obviously—and I can bring my moisture meter documentation from yesterday's visit.

Character 1: [exhausted] This is costing me the house! [voice breaking slightly] They think I'm trying to negotiate in bad faith. [angrier] Do you know what your sloppy work has done to my credibility?

798 Customer Support: Sir, I've been doing this for fifteen years, and I stand by my findings. However, if there's been an error, we need to—to rectify this immediately. Can we meet at the property this afternoon?

Character 1: [resigned] Fine. Three o'clock. [threateningly quiet] But you better bring every piece of equipment you own. [deep breath] And Mike? Your company's insurance better be up to date.

799 Customer Support: I'll be there with my full kit and all yesterday's readings documented. [reassuringly] We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise you that.

Character 1: [skeptically] You promise? [short laugh] Like you promised a thorough inspection? [pause] Just—just make sure you actually climb into the attic this time.

800 Customer Support: [slightly offended] Mr. Davidson, I did access that attic, and I have the photos to—[catching himself] Let's review everything together at three, shall we?

Character 1: [tiredly] Yeah, we shall. [muttering] Though at this point, I'm wondering if I should bring my own inspector to watch you work.

801 Customer Support: That's absolutely your right, and honestly, I'd welcome a second opinion. [confidently] Professional oversight never hurt anyone, especially when there's this much confusion.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh. Well. [slowly] That's actually... reasonable of you. [suspiciously] You're not planning to suddenly find different results, are you?

802 Customer Support: Sir, I report what I see, nothing more, nothing less. If I made an error—which I doubt—but if I did, I'll own it completely.

Character 1: [sighs heavily] Alright, Mike. Three o'clock then. [warning tone] But if this kills my deal, we're going to have a very different conversation about liability.

803 Customer Support: Understood completely. I'll also bring contact information for remediation specialists, just in case my findings are confirmed and you need quick action for the sellers.

Character 1: [grudgingly] Fine. And Mike? [pause] [quietly] I really hope you're wrong about that mold. [defeated] I really love this house.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

804 [Sarcastic] Oh wow, thanks for, um, "accidentally" scheduling that meeting during my lunch break for the third time this week. [Tsk] [Fast] Real subtle.

805 [Disappointed] I just—I don't understand why every email has to have that little dig at the end, you know? [Sigh]

806 [Whisper] Did you hear what she said about my presentation? [Slow] Something about how it was "surprisingly competent for someone at my level."

807 [Happy] No no, I actually love getting credit for my work! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Even if it's, like, buried in the appendix where nobody'll see it.

808 [Angry] I'm gonna—actually, you know what, I'm done pretending those comments are just jokes. [Groan]

809 [Fast] Okay so basically they're saying I did it wrong but they won't actually tell me what the right way is? [Disappointed] [Tsk]

810 [Sad] It's kinda exhausting, honestly, trying to figure out if they're actually mad or just being... them. [Sigh]

811 [Shout] Yes, I heard you the first time! [Angry] [Fast] The passive-aggressive sticky notes aren't making your point any clearer!

812 [Slow] I mean, when someone says "whatever you think is best" but then, like, undermines every decision you make... [Disappointed] [Sigh]

813 [Chuckle] Sure, cc'ing the boss on every tiny thing is totally normal behavior, right? [Sarcastic]

814 [Whisper] [Fast] They literally waited until I left to redo the entire project setup—didn't even tell me, I just found out from Sarah.

815 [Happy] Oh, I'm fine! [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Just peachy with being volunteered for weekend work through a group email!

816 [Angry] The thing is—no, actually, forget professional courtesy, they're just being a jerk at this point. [Groan]

817 [Sad] [Slow] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, um, if I'm being too sensitive about this whole situation or if it's really happening.

818 [Disappointed] Another backhanded compliment about how I'm "getting better at least"—gee, thanks for the, uh, the encouragement. [Tsk]

819 [Fast] [Whisper] Quick question—is it normal for someone to "forget" to invite you to team drinks like four times in a row?

820 [Shout] I wasn't even—I didn't ask for your help! [Angry] [Fast] But sure, go ahead and tell everyone how you "fixed" my work!

821 [Chuckle] Y'know, I've started keeping screenshots of everything 'cause somehow my ideas become their ideas pretty quickly. [Sarcastic]

822 [Slow] [Sad] It's the constant little comments that just... they kinda wear you down after a while, I guess. [Sigh]

823 [Happy] Honestly? [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Nothing says "teamwork" like being told you're "brave" for presenting that "interesting" approach!

824 SCENARIO: Casually mentioning a small lie they told at work, then thinking about documentation, then realizing there's a paper trail that contradicts them, ending in professional lie anxiety

==================================================

[casual]

So I had this weird thing happen at work today. My manager asked if I'd finished reviewing those client contracts, and I was like, yeah, totally done. Which, you know, I wasn't completely done, but I was like ninety percent there.

[conversational]

It's not a big deal, right? I mean, everyone does that. You say you're done when you're mostly done. [light laugh] I figured I'd just wrap up the last few pages tonight and no one would know the difference.

[a bit uncertain]

But then I started thinking about it, because you know how they have us log everything in that system now? Like, every time we open a document, when we save it, all that digital footprint stuff?

[more worried]

And I'm realizing— wait. [nervous laugh] If they really wanted to check, they could just look at the timestamps, right? Like when I last accessed those files?

[growing anxiety]

Oh god. Oh no. The last entry was yesterday morning. Yesterday! [sharp exhale] If my manager pulls that report, it's gonna show I haven't even touched those contracts since before she asked me about them.

[spiraling]

What am I gonna do? I can't just— I can't go back and say "Actually, funny story..." [groan] She's gonna think I'm completely incompetent. Or worse, dishonest! Which I guess I am now? [frantic] Ugh, why did I say that?
