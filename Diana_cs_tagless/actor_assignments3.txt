Script: 15dba575_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three weeks. I was there for three weeks.

186 Character 2: I know, I—god, I know. I'm so sorry. I kept meaning to come, I swear I did, but then—okay that sounds terrible. That's not—let me start over.

Character 1: Don't bother.

187 Character 2: No no no, please, just—just let me explain. I was gonna come that first weekend, right? But then my mom had that thing and I thought, okay, I'll go Monday. But Monday turned into Tuesday and then—[groan] I'm the worst friend ever.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

188 Character 2: I deserve that. I totally deserve that. I just—I got so caught up in my own stupid stuff, y'know? Like work was insane and I kept thinking I'd have more time later, but that's not an excuse. Nothing is.

Character 1: Everyone else managed to find time.

189 Character 2: I know. Even Jake came and he lives like three hours away. I'm—I'm literally twenty minutes from the hospital and I couldn't—god, I really messed up, didn't I? [nervous laugh] Like majorly, majorly messed up.

Character 1: I kept asking the nurses if you'd called.

190 Character 2: Oh god. Oh god, that's—I'm so sorry. I should've at least called. I wanted to but then I felt guilty for not visiting and then I felt like calling would be worse somehow? Like insulting? I dunno, that's so stupid, I'm so stupid.

Character 1: It was scary. Being there alone.

191 Character 2: I know. I mean—no, I don't know, but I can imagine and I—you shouldn't have been alone. You shouldn't have had to wonder where I was. I'm supposed to be your best friend and I just... wasn't there.

Character 1: I really needed you.

192 Character 2: I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. There's literally nothing I can say that makes this okay, is there? I just—I wanna fix this but I don't know how. Tell me what to do. Please.

Character 1: You can't fix three weeks of wondering if you even cared.

193 Character 2: But I did care! I do care! I thought about you constantly, I just—I couldn't make myself go. [sigh] Hospitals kinda freak me out since my dad, but that's not—that's my problem, not yours. I should've sucked it up.

Character 1: Your dad. I forgot about that.

194 Character 2: No, don't—don't make excuses for me. That was five years ago, I should be over it by now. And even if I'm not, even if hospitals make me wanna throw up, I should've been there. You needed me and I wasn't there.

Character 1: I'm sorry too. For being so cold. I'm just hurt.

195 Character 2: No no no, you have every right to be cold. Every right to be furious actually. I'm just—I'm grateful you're even talking to me, honestly. And I promise, if there's ever a next time—which hopefully there won't be—but if there is, I'll be there. Day one. I promise.

Script: 26f9cdc1_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You said my presentation was great.

196 Character 2: It—it was good! I mean, okay, maybe not great great, but it wasn't bad either. You're acting like I completely lied to you or something.

Character 1: You did lie.

197 Character 2: That's not—[scoff] come on, that's not fair. I was trying to be supportive, y'know? You were so nervous about it and I didn't wanna pile on when you were already stressed.

Character 1: I asked for honest feedback. Specifically.

198 Character 2: And I gave you feedback! I told you about the slides and the—the timing thing. I just didn't mention every single little issue because honestly? I didn't think you wanted to hear it.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

199 Character 2: Okay okay, fine, but you gotta understand—you literally came to me right after, all excited, and you were like "did I do okay?" What was I supposed to say? [frustrated laugh] "Actually, no, you bombed it"?

Character 1: Yes. If that's what happened.

200 Character 2: But that's not what happened! It was—look, it was fine, it just wasn't as good as you thought it was. There's a difference between being honest and being cruel, y'know?

Character 1: I made a fool of myself in front of everyone.

201 Character 2: No you didn't—okay, maybe it was a little rough, but nobody's thinking about it as much as you are. Seriously. Everyone's forgotten about it already.

Character 1: My boss hasn't.

202 Character 2: Your boss is—[sigh] okay, I didn't know they were gonna be there. If I'd known that, I would've been more... I dunno, more direct about stuff. But you made it sound like just a practice run.

Character 1: I never said that.

203 Character 2: You didn't not say it either! Look look, I'm sorry you're upset, I am, but I was trying to help. Maybe I didn't do it perfectly, but at least I was there, right?

Character 1: Being there means being honest.

204 Character 2: And being a friend means—means sometimes protecting people from stuff they don't need to hear! You can't just expect me to be brutally honest all the time when you're clearly not ready for it.

Character 1: How would you know if I'm ready?

205 Character 2: Because I know you! And honestly? The fact that you're this upset kinda proves my point. You say you want honest feedback but then when things go wrong, you're acting like I'm the bad guy for trying to spare your feelings.

Script: 49c24cdc_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You weren't there when I needed you.

206 Character 2: I know, I know how it looks, but I was literally—my mom was in the hospital, okay? I couldn't just drop everything and—I mean, I wanted to be there, but I physically couldn't.

Character 1: You could've texted. Called. Something.

207 Character 2: That's—okay, that's not entirely fair. I was barely keeping it together myself. [Sigh] You're acting like I just decided to ignore you for fun when I was sitting in the ICU watching my mom on a ventilator.

Character 1: I didn't know about your mom.

208 Character 2: Because I didn't wanna dump that on you while you were going through your thing! I figured—I dunno, I thought I was doing the right thing by not making it about me. Apparently that was wrong too.

Character 1: So you just disappeared instead.

209 Character 2: I didn't disappear, I just—look look, I get that you're hurt, but come on. I was trying to handle my own crisis without making yours worse. [frustrated laugh] Can't exactly win here, can I?

Character 1: A simple "I can't talk right now" would've helped.

210 Character 2: You're right, okay okay, you're right about that. I should've—I mean, I could've sent something. But honestly? I wasn't thinking straight. I was just trying to survive each day, y'know?

Character 1: I thought you were avoiding me.

211 Character 2: Well I wasn't. I literally wasn't even on my phone for like three days straight. And now you're—fine, be mad, but don't act like I deliberately abandoned you when I was drowning too.

Character 1: You always show up. Always. Except this time.

212 Character 2: And that's—[scoff]—that's exactly the problem, isn't it? One time, ONE time I can't be there, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?

Character 1: It was important.

213 Character 2: So was my mom possibly dying! Jesus. I'm sorry I couldn't be in two places at once. I'm sorry I'm not—I dunno, superhuman or whatever you apparently need me to be.

Character 1: That's not what I meant.

214 Character 2: Then what? What did you mean? Because honestly, it feels like you're punishing me for having my own emergency at the wrong time, which—that's pretty messed up actually.

Character 1: I just needed you.

215 Character 2: And I needed to make sure my mom didn't die alone. [quieter] Look, I'm—I'm sorry I wasn't there. I am. But I'm not gonna apologize for prioritizing that. I just... I can't.

Script: 6544ecf3_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You just sat there.

216 Character 2: I know, I know—god, I'm so sorry. I just—your mom was being so intense and I froze up, okay? I wanted to say something, I really did, but she just kept going and going and I—[nervous laugh] I completely chickened out.

Character 1: While she tore me apart.

217 Character 2: That's not—okay, yeah. Yeah, she was being awful. And I should've—I mean, I literally had like ten different things I wanted to say but my brain just... shut down? You know how I get around parents.

Character 1: My best friend. Right there. Silent.

218 Character 2: Please don't—I mean, you're right. You're absolutely right. I failed you and I—I've been feeling sick about it since Saturday. Like genuinely nauseous thinking about how I just sat there like an idiot while she said all that stuff about your job and your choices and—ugh, I'm the worst friend ever.

Character 1: Yeah.

219 Character 2: I keep replaying it in my head, y'know? Like all the things I should've said. How I should've been like "actually, Mrs. Chen, that's not fair" or—or something. Anything. [groan] But no no no, I just smiled and nodded like a coward.

Character 1: She thinks you agree with her now.

220 Character 2: What? No! I don't—oh my god, I didn't even think about that. She probably—oh no. That makes it so much worse. I was just trying to be polite but that's—that's not an excuse, I know that's not an excuse.

Character 1: "Trying to be polite." To her.

221 Character 2: I know how that sounds—wait, that came out wrong. I wasn't choosing her over you, I swear I wasn't. I just—I dunno, I got so uncomfortable and my default is to just... avoid conflict? Which is stupid, I know it's stupid, especially when someone's attacking my best friend right in front of me.

Character 1: It hurt. A lot.

222 Character 2: I know. I know it did and I—[sigh] I can't imagine how alone you must've felt. Like, your own mom going at you like that and then me just... abandoning you basically. That's what I did, right? I basically abandoned you when you needed me.

Character 1: That's exactly what you did.

223 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right and I—I wanna make this right somehow. I mean, I can't go back and fix it but maybe I could talk to her? Like separately? Tell her how wrong she was and how amazing you're actually doing and—okay, I'm rambling but I just really really need you to know how sorry I am.

Character 1: You'd actually do that? Talk to her?

224 Character 2: Yes! God, yes, absolutely. I should've—that's what I should've done in the first place instead of sitting there like a deer in headlights. And honestly? I've been practicing what I'm gonna say. Like literally talking to myself in the mirror about how your choices are valid and she needs to respect them.

Character 1: That's... I mean. Okay. That would help.

225 Character 2: Really? You'd—you'd let me try? Because I swear I won't freeze up this time. I've got your back, I promise. I know I should've had it before and I completely failed but—but I'm gonna fix this. Or at least try to. You deserve that, you deserve so much better than how I acted. [quieter] I'm really, really sorry.

226 SCENARIO: trying to decide which line at the grocery store is fastest

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, which line is gonna be— which one's gonna be fastest here? Let me just, uh, let me scope this out real quick.

[thoughtful]

So there's the, um, the express lane, but that lady has like— that's definitely more than ten items, right? I mean, I'm not gonna be the grocery store police, but come on. That's, uh, that's clearly a full cart situation.

[slightly incredulous] 

And then there's— oh, wait wait wait, this cashier over here looks new. She's got that, um, that deer-in-the-headlights thing going on. [tsk] That's gonna be slow, right? Like, I don't wanna be mean, but I also don't wanna be here for— for thirty minutes buying, uh, buying yogurt and bananas.

[calculating]

Hmm. Middle lane has fewer people, but— but that guy's got produce that's not labeled. That's always a nightmare. The cashier's gonna have to call someone over and—

[resigned]

You know what? Screw it. I'm just gonna— I'm gonna pick one and, um, and accept my fate. This is fine. [sigh] It's all fine.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 5d369562 | Role: Character 1 (A)

227 Character 1: [nervously] So, um, I have something to tell you. [clearing throat] Remember how I've been feeling weird lately? [whispered] I took a test this morning, and... I'm pregnant. Like, actually pregnant. Two pink lines pregnant.

Character 2: [Sharp gasp] WHAT?! [voice cracking] Oh my God, oh my God! [suddenly quiet] Wait, this is insane because I literally have a test in my purse right now. I've been too scared to take it alone.

228 Character 1: [urgently] Take it! Take it right now! [pleading tone] I'll wait with you in the bathroom. [soft squeal] Can you imagine if we were pregnant together? That would be the most us thing ever to happen!

Character 2: [shaky breath] Okay, okay, I'm doing it. [determined] Three minutes never felt so long. [mumbling quickly] What if it's positive? What if it's negative? What if the test is broken? Oh God, my hands won't stop shaking!

229 Character 1: [soothing voice] Just breathe with me. [inhale] [exhale] Everything's going to be fine either way. We've been through worse, remember? Like that time we got food poisoning in Cabo and thought we were literally dying together.

Character 2: [hysterical laugh] Don't make me laugh right now! [panicked whisper] Oh my God, it's been three minutes. [trembling] I can't look. You look for me. Please? Just tell me what you see. I can't do this.

230 Character 1: [stunned silence] [barely audible] Two lines. [SHRIEK] TWO LINES! You're pregnant! We're both pregnant! At the same time! This is absolutely crazy! How did this even happen? Well, I know HOW, but like, the timing!

Character 2: [sobbing] I can't believe this! [laughing through tears] Our kids are going to be best friends! [getting louder] They're going to grow up together! Built-in playmates! Oh my God, we need to tell our husbands immediately!

231 Character 1: [giddy whisper] Wait, wait, let's just sit with this for a second. [dreamy tone] Just us two. [sniffling] Before the chaos starts, before the planning and panic. Right now it's just our little secret miracle.

Character 2: [warmly] You're right, this moment is ours. [quiet amazement] Nine months from now, everything changes. [giggling softly] Can you imagine us pregnant at the same time? The mood swings alone will be legendary. Our poor, poor husbands.

232 Character 1: [excitedly fast] Oh God, the cravings! The matching bumps! [squealing] The joint baby shower! We can do those cheesy maternity photos together! You know, the ones we always made fun of but secretly wanted to do anyway!

Character 2: [mock serious] Hold up, I call dibs on not finding out the gender. [playfully] You can find out yours if you want. [sing-song voice] But I want the surprise! Also, we're definitely getting those pregnancy pillows immediately.

233 Character 1: [overwhelmed] This is so surreal. [voice breaking] Last week we were complaining about being tired all the time. [soft laugh] Now we know why! The universe really said "plot twist" and delivered hard, didn't it?

Character 2: [contemplative] You know what's crazy? [slowly] We always joked about doing everything together. [getting emotional] College, weddings, and now this. Sometimes I think we share the same cosmic timing or something. It's beautiful and terrifying.

234 Character 1: [worried whisper] Are you scared? [rushed words] Because I'm terrified but also the happiest I've ever been. [shaky voice] It's like every emotion at once. Is this normal? Please tell me you feel it too.

Character 2: [reassuring tone] Of course I'm scared! [firm voice] But we're doing this together, like always. [chuckling] Remember our pact from high school? [tenderly] "No major life event alone." Well, we're definitely keeping that promise now.

235 Character 1: [through happy tears] I love you so much. [hiccup laugh] Our kids are going to have the best aunt ever. [getting louder] Oh my God, we're going to be moms! Actual moms! With actual tiny humans depending on us!

Character 2: [breathless] Stop, you're going to make me cry again! [snorting laugh] My mascara is already ruined. [whimpering] But yes, they're getting the best aunt ever. Both of them. This is the beginning of everything.

236 Character 1: [suddenly practical] Okay, we need a plan. [determined] Doctors appointments, vitamins, telling our families. [giggling nervously] My mom is going to absolutely lose her mind. Yours might actually faint. Should we tell them together too?

Character 2: [exhausted but happy] Yes to everything. [peaceful sigh] But first, let's just sit here another minute. [whispered awe] Two best friends, two babies, one incredible journey. [soft laugh] This is going to be the adventure of our lives.

Script: 7803949c | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, I'm calling about my new windows installed last month—order number WX-4521-B. [sighs heavily] There's a terrible draft coming through, and um, it's getting worse every day. [irritated] My heating bill for November was $387!

237 Customer Support: I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with your windows. Let me pull up your account—that's WX-4521-B, correct? I see here you had six double-pane units installed on October 15th at 1842 Maple Street.

Character 1: [exasperated] Yes, that's right, and I specifically paid extra for the energy-efficient model! [more loudly] The draft is so bad in my living room that, that the curtains are literally moving. [groans] This is completely unacceptable for $8,200 worth of windows.

238 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, and that certainly shouldn't be happening with our EcoSeal Pro series. Can you tell me which specific windows are affected? We'll need to schedule a technician to assess the installation and check the weatherstripping.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, where do I even start? The two in the living room, definitely, and [getting angrier] the master bedroom one whistles—actually whistles—at night! [exhausted sigh] My warranty number is EW-2023-7749A if that helps speed things up.

239 Customer Support: That sounds absolutely terrible, and I'm making detailed notes in your file right now. [more firmly] Under warranty EW-2023-7749A, you're covered for installation defects. Our next available appointment slot is Thursday at 2 PM, or we have Friday morning at 9:30.

Character 1: [incredulous] Thursday? That's five days away! [voice rising] Do you, do you understand it's 28 degrees outside right now? [desperately] I've got towels stuffed under the windows like it's 1952 or something—this is ridiculous!

240 Customer Support: I know this is incredibly inconvenient, and I wish I had something sooner. Let me check for cancellations... Actually, if you're flexible, I can put you on our priority list with code PRI-8834 for any earlier openings.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, put me on that list, but I'm taking Thursday at 2 PM regardless. [demanding] And I want the senior technician, not some, um, trainee who doesn't know what they're doing. [sighs] Can you guarantee they'll actually fix it this time?

241 Customer Support: I'm assigning Tom Harrison, badge number TH-445, who's been with us twelve years. He specializes in weatherization issues and will bring a full diagnostic kit. I'm also crediting your account $150 for the inconvenience—you'll see that as credit CR-20231127-B.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well, that's... that's something at least. [suspicious] But what happens if Tom finds major installation problems? [worried] I can't afford to pay for another installation, and I shouldn't have to after spending so much already!

242 Customer Support: Any installation errors are completely covered under your warranty, no questions asked. Tom will document everything with photos and file report number INS-5521-TH if repairs are needed. We stand behind our work one hundred percent, I promise you that.

Character 1: [cautiously optimistic] Okay, I'm holding you to that promise. [matter-of-factly] My phone number is 555-0147 if anything changes with the schedule. [sighs] I just want warm windows that, you know, actually work like windows should.

243 Customer Support: Absolutely, and that's exactly what you paid for and deserve. [organized tone] I have 555-0147 confirmed, and you'll receive a text reminder with Tom's photo ID the morning of. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this issue?

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Actually, yes—can you email me all this information? [more firmly] The appointment details, Tom's badge number, that credit reference, everything. [directly] My email is janet.morrison@email.com, and I want it all documented in writing, please.

244 Customer Support: Of course, I'm sending that to janet.morrison@email.com right now—you should have it within five minutes. It'll include case number CS-11247-DFT for your records. The email will also have Tom's direct line if you need to reschedule.

Character 1: [somewhat satisfied] Good, thank you for that. [sighs tiredly] I really hope this gets resolved because I've been recommending your company to neighbors. [pointedly] But if this doesn't get fixed properly, that's going to change pretty quickly, you understand?

245 Customer Support: I completely understand, and we value your referrals tremendously. Tom will take care of everything on Thursday, I assure you. We truly appreciate your patience with us during this frustrating situation, Ms. Morrison.

Character 1: [accepting] Alright, I'll be waiting for that email and for Tom on Thursday at 2 PM sharp. [warningly] He better not be late because I'm taking time off work for this. [sighs] Thank you for the credit and for listening, I suppose.

246 Customer Support: Tom is always punctual, and he'll call thirty minutes before arrival as per protocol. Thank you for calling ClearView Windows, Ms. Morrison. We'll get those drafts fixed and your home comfortable again—you have my word on that.

Script: ea1a48c1 | Role: Customer Support

247 Customer Support: Good afternoon, I see you've got another appointment today—your fourth one this month. [apologetically] I know this has been, uh, frustrating, but I promise we'll get this sorted. What seems to be happening with your service now?

Character 1: [exasperated] What's happening? The same thing that's been happening for three weeks! [louder] My internet cuts out every evening at exactly 7 PM. [groans] I've explained this to three different technicians, and somehow—somehow—it's still broken.

248 Customer Support: Right, I've got your service history pulled up here, and I can see the previous visits. The notes say they replaced your modem twice and, um, checked the lines. Today we're going to try a different approach entirely.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, a different approach? Like actually fixing it this time? [bitter laugh] The last guy told me everything was "within normal parameters" while my Zoom call was literally freezing. [frustrated] Do you know how embarrassing that is during work presentations?

249 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration—three visits with no resolution is unacceptable. [speaking faster] Look, I'm actually the senior tech they send when... when things get complicated. I've seen this pattern before with the 7 PM timing.

Character 1: [skeptically] You've seen it before? Then why didn't anyone else know about it? [sighs heavily] I've lost count of how many hours I've wasted waiting for you people. [more quietly] My kids can't even do their homework properly anymore.

250 Customer Support: The 7 PM issue usually indicates interference from, uh, neighborhood equipment kicking on—could be someone's ham radio or industrial equipment. Previous techs probably just ran basic diagnostics. I brought specialized equipment to track electromagnetic interference today.

Character 1: [incredulous] Ham radio? Are you seriously telling me someone's hobby is destroying my internet? [laughs bitterly] I pay $150 a month for this "premium" service. [demanding] How is this even legal if it interferes with paid services?

251 Customer Support: We can file an FCC complaint if needed, but let's first confirm that's actually the issue. I need to check your external connection box and run some tests during that 7 PM window. Would you be okay if I stay until then?

Character 1: [surprised] You'll actually stay until it happens? [softer] The other techs just... left after twenty minutes. [sighs] Yes, please stay—I'll even make coffee if it means finally fixing this nightmare.

252 Customer Support: Coffee sounds great, and yes, I'm staying until we solve this. That's the difference between a fourth visit and, well, getting it right. Let me grab my spectrum analyzer from the truck.

Character 1: [cautiously hopeful] This is the first time someone's brought actual specialized equipment. [more animated] The last guy just had a basic tablet and kept saying "hmm" at it. [curious] How long have you been doing this?

253 Customer Support: Fifteen years, and trust me, I've seen everything from squirrels chewing cables to—to microwave ovens taking down entire blocks. [laughs softly] Your case isn't even the weirdest this week. But it's definitely fixable.

Character 1: [relieved] Fifteen years? Thank God they finally sent someone experienced. [exhausted] I was about to switch providers, but my wife said they're all the same. [pleading] Please tell me she's wrong and this can actually work properly.

254 Customer Support: Every provider has issues, but this specific problem—we can fix it today. I'm already seeing some unusual readings on my equipment here. Has anyone new moved into the neighborhood recently, maybe three weeks ago?

Character 1: [thinking] Actually... yes! The house behind us, they moved in about a month ago. [excitedly] They have this massive antenna setup in their backyard. [realizing] Wait, is that seriously what's been ruining my internet?

255 Customer Support: Bingo! That's exactly the timeframe you mentioned. Amateur radio operators sometimes use amplifiers that, uh, aren't properly shielded. [confidently] I can install filters that'll block their interference completely.

Character 1: [angrily] Are you kidding me? Three service calls and nobody thought to ask about new neighbors? [groans loudly] I've been pulling my hair out, missing deadlines, and it's because of someone's antenna? [desperately] Can you install those filters right now?

256 Customer Support: Installing them as we speak—should take about ten minutes. [reassuringly] And I'm documenting everything so if you ever have issues again, any tech will know exactly what happened. No more guessing games.

Character 1: [gratefully] I can't believe it's finally getting fixed on the fourth try. [laughs nervously] You know what? Forget coffee—if this works, I'm ordering pizza. [hopefully] This will actually work permanently, right? Not just another temporary fix?

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

257 [Disappointed] Wait, wait, wait—you literally just told me five minutes ago that you were at home all night. [Slow] So how exactly did Marcus see you downtown?

258 [Sarcastic] Oh wow, that's, uh, that's really interesting because I have the receipts right here on my phone. [Chuckle] Should we look at them together?

259 [Whisper] You know what? I'm gonna pretend I didn't just hear that because—[Fast] actually no, I can't, that's the third different story you've told me today.

260 [Angry] Are you seriously gonna stand there and—[Shout] I WAS THERE! I saw you with my own eyes!

261 [Happy] This is actually kinda hilarious because, um, Sarah already told me everything. [Laugh] Did you really think she wouldn't?

262 [Sad] I just... I don't understand why you'd even need to lie about something so small, you know? [Sigh] It's like, what else aren't you telling me?

263 [Fast] Okay so let me get this straight—first it was Tuesday, then it was Thursday, and now suddenly it never happened at all? [Tsk]

264 [Slow] That's funny because, uh, your location was on the whole time and I can literally see where you were. [Disappointed] Wanna try again?

265 [Sarcastic] Right, right, your phone just mysteriously died at the exact moment you were supposed to be there. [Slow] How convenient is that?

266 [Whisper] Stop. Just... stop talking, okay? [Sad] Every word you're saying is making this worse and we both know it.

267 [Angry] I'm not stupid—I mean, do you honestly think I'm that gullible? [Fast] The timestamps don't even match up!

268 [Chuckle] You're, like, the worst liar I've ever met in my entire life. [Happy] Seriously, your eye is literally twitching right now!

269 [Disappointed] So basically what you're telling me is that everyone else is lying except you? [Sarcastic] Yeah, that seems super likely.

270 [Shout] Don't you dare—[Angry] DON'T YOU DARE try to flip this around on me when I have proof!

271 [Slow] Um, you do realize that you posted about it on Instagram, right? [Tsk] Like, it's still there if you wanna check.

272 [Sad] I gave you so many chances to just be honest with me and you—[Sigh] God, I feel like such an idiot.

273 [Fast] Hold up, hold up—you couldn't have been stuck in traffic because they closed that road like three weeks ago for construction. [Disappointed] Nice try though.

274 [Happy] Oh my god, your face right now is just—[Laugh] [Laugh] You totally forgot about the security cameras, didn't you?

275 [Whisper] You know what's really messed up? [Slow] I actually would've understood if you'd just told me the truth from the beginning.

276 [Sarcastic] Mmm-hmm, and I suppose your identical twin was the one using your credit card at that exact location? [Groan] Just admit it already.

277 SCENARIO: Excited about buying something, then finds out it's sold out, then discovers it in a different color they like better

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my God, you have no idea how perfect my timing was today! I've been stalking that leather jacket on the Madewell website for like— for weeks now, just waiting for it to go on sale, and today I finally just said screw it, I'm getting it.

[enthusiastic]

Like I had the whole thing planned out, I was gonna wear it this weekend to Sarah's party, and then obviously like every day after that because it's literally perfect. I've been thinking about this jacket for so long, it's like— it's basically already mine, you know?

[deflated]

So I go to check out and... sold out. Completely sold out in my size. Just, boom, gone. I'm sitting there staring at my laptop like an idiot, and I'm just like— [groan] of course. Of course this happens to me.

[frustrated]

I was so annoyed, I was like why did I wait so long? I should've just bought it full price when I first saw it, but no, I had to be all responsible and— and budget-conscious or whatever.

[surprised] [curious]

Wait, hold on. It's saying there's still— there's one left but it's in this burnt orange color instead of the black one I wanted. Let me just... 

[delighted] [amazed]

Oh wow. Oh this is actually— this is so much better! The orange is gorgeous, it's like perfect for fall, and it'll go with those boots I just got. God, sometimes things just work out exactly how they're supposed to, don't they?
