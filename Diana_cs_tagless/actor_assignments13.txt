Character 1: So you told Marcus about my panic attacks.

1042 Character 2: Oh god—okay, I didn't—I mean I did but it wasn't like... I wasn't gossiping or anything, I swear. We were just talking and it kinda slipped out and I immediately regretted it.

Character 1: It slipped out?

1043 Character 2: No no no, that's—that's not what I meant. Not slipped out like it was nothing. I just... Marcus was talking about his own anxiety stuff and I wanted to be supportive so I mentioned—[groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I?

Character 1: You told him about the medication too.

1044 Character 2: I... yeah. I did. God, hearing you say it like that makes me wanna just disappear. I know how private that was, I know you trusted me with that and I just—I completely betrayed that trust, didn't I?

Character 1: Three people asked me about it today. Three.

1045 Character 2: What? No, that's—Marcus wouldn't have told anyone else, he promised me he... [nervous laugh] okay that sounds really stupid now that I'm saying it out loud. Of course he told people. Of course he did.

Character 1: You had no right.

1046 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm honestly disgusted with myself right now. Like, you came to me when you were struggling and trusted me with something so personal and I just... treated it like it was nothing.

Character 1: It wasn't nothing to me.

1047 Character 2: I know. I know it wasn't. And I think—no, I know that's what makes this so awful. You were being so brave, y'know? Opening up about everything you're going through and I just... I ruined that.

Character 1: I can't even go to group study now without people looking at me weird.

1048 Character 2: Oh my god, I didn't even think about—that's where everyone hangs out. [sigh] I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I'll talk to them, I'll tell them to stop being weird about it or—or whatever you need me to do.

Character 1: Don't make it worse.

1049 Character 2: Right, yeah, talking to them would probably—yeah. Um, is there... is there anything I can do? Like literally anything to make this even a little bit better? I just wanna fix this somehow but I don't—I dunno how.

Character 1: You can't fix it. That's the point.

1050 Character 2: I know. You're right, I can't just—I can't undo what I did. But maybe I can... I mean, going forward, if you ever wanna talk about anything again—which you probably don't and I totally get that—but I promise I would never, ever break your trust again.

Character 1: I need time. I can't just pretend this didn't happen.

1051 Character 2: Yeah, no, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—I really am sorry. And I hope... I hope eventually you can forgive me, but I get it if you can't. I really messed up and I—I know that.

Script: 22ef2e8a_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You went to Mom's grave without me.

1052 Character 2: Oh god, I—I was gonna tell you, I swear. It wasn't planned or anything, I just—I was driving past the cemetery and I thought I'd stop for like five minutes, you know?

Character 1: Five minutes. On her birthday.

1053 Character 2: I know, I know how it sounds. But listen, I—I wasn't thinking, okay? I was having such a bad morning and I just needed to [nervous laugh] I dunno, talk to her? That's—that's not an excuse though.

Character 1: We always go together.

1054 Character 2: We do. We always do, and I—fuck, I'm so sorry. I wasn't trying to exclude you or anything like that. It was honestly just this impulsive thing where I pulled over and—and then I was already there, y'know?

Character 1: You posted flowers on Instagram.

1055 Character 2: That was—okay that was really stupid of me. Like genuinely, what was I thinking? I shouldn't have—I mean, of course you'd see it. [Groan] I'm such an idiot sometimes, I really am.

Character 1: Did you at least tell her I said happy birthday?

1056 Character 2: I did! I did, I promise. I told her—I told her you were probably gonna kill me for coming without you, actually. And that you'd probably bring those yellow roses she liked next time.

Character 1: I already bought them. They're sitting in my kitchen.

1057 Character 2: Oh. Oh no, I—we can go again? Like, together? I know it's not the same but maybe we could go this weekend and—and do it properly this time. The way we always do.

Character 1: It was supposed to be special. The tenth anniversary.

1058 Character 2: Shit. Shit shit shit, you're right. I didn't even—I wasn't thinking about that. God, I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? [Sigh] I completely ruined it.

Character 1: I had a whole thing planned.

1059 Character 2: Wait, you—you did? What kind of thing? No wait, that's—I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me. I don't deserve to know after what I—after this.

Character 1: Her favorite songs. That old portable speaker. Wine.

1060 Character 2: The—the rosé she used to sneak us? Oh man, that's... that's really beautiful actually. We can—we can still do that, right? I mean, if you'll let me come with you?

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe. I need to think about it.

1061 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, of course, take—take all the time you need. I really am sorry though. Like from the bottom of my heart. She meant everything to you and I—I should've remembered that. I should've waited.

Script: 104aefe2_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Third time this month.

1062 Character 2: Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm literally the worst, I get it. But there was this whole thing with my car and then—wait, that's not even the point. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

Character 1: You always have an excuse.

1063 Character 2: No no no, that's—okay, I hear how that sounds. It's not an excuse, I swear, it's just... [sigh] everything keeps happening at once, y'know? Like I genuinely wanna hang out, I do, but then something comes up and I—I dunno, I panic.

Character 1: Right.

1064 Character 2: Please don't do the one-word thing. I can't—I mean, I deserve it, obviously, but it's killing me. You're like, one of my favorite people and I keep screwing this up and I don't even know why I do this.

Character 1: Maybe because you don't actually care.

1065 Character 2: What? No! That's not—god, is that really what you think? [nervous laugh] I care so much it's actually embarrassing. I literally had our plans in my calendar, with like three reminders, and then my sister called crying about her boyfriend and I just—I forgot everything else existed.

Character 1: Your sister's boyfriend. That's the emergency this time?

1066 Character 2: Okay when you say it like that it sounds—it sounds stupid, I know. But she was really upset and I'm basically the only person she talks to about this stuff, and I meant to text you but then hours went by and—ugh, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Making excuses.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

1067 Character 2: I don't mean to be like this. Honestly, I think there's something wrong with me? Like I get so overwhelmed and then I just... freeze. And then I'm too anxious to reach out because I know you're mad—which makes it worse, I know I know.

Character 1: You could've just texted. Ten seconds.

1068 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right. That's—that's the bare minimum and I couldn't even do that. [groan] I keep telling myself I'm gonna be better, like next time I won't mess up, but then I do and I hate myself for it.

Character 1: I'm tired of being the only one who shows up.

1069 Character 2: I know. And that's—that's completely fair. Um, what if we just... what if you pick something and I'll be there no matter what? Like literally nothing will stop me. I'll turn off my phone, tell everyone I'm dead, whatever it takes.

Character 1: I've heard that before.

1070 Character 2: No but this time—okay, I hear myself. But I mean it, I really really mean it this time. You matter to me, like so much, and I've been a garbage friend and I wanna fix this. Please let me—just let me prove it? One more chance?

Character 1: One. That's it.

1071 Character 2: Yes! Okay, yes, one chance. I won't—I promise I won't mess this up. And if I even think about flaking I'll... I dunno, I'll Venmo you a hundred bucks or something. Actually yeah, let's do that. I'm putting it in writing right now.

Script: f8881a63_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You forgot my mom's surgery was today.

1072 Character 2: Wait, what? That was—I thought that was next week? I swear you said the fifteenth, not—god, I'm sorry, but I genuinely didn't know it was today.

Character 1: I texted you yesterday. Twice.

1073 Character 2: Okay, okay, I probably—look, I've been completely underwater with work stuff and I just... [sigh] I know that's not an excuse, but my brain's been like, completely fried lately.

Character 1: It's always something.

1074 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not fair. You know I have issues with this stuff. I'm not just being careless, I literally can't hold onto things sometimes, y'know?

Character 1: I needed you there.

1075 Character 2: And I wanna be there for you, I do, but you're acting like I'm doing this on purpose. Like I wake up and decide "hey, let's forget something important today." [frustrated laugh] That's not how it works.

Character 1: You remember things that matter to you just fine.

1076 Character 2: Seriously? You're gonna—that's such a low blow. Some things stick better than others, that doesn't mean I don't care about your stuff. I use reminders, I write everything down, I'm trying here.

Character 1: Not hard enough, apparently.

1077 Character 2: Look look, I get that you're upset, and you have every right to be, but I'm kinda getting tired of apologizing for something I literally cannot control sometimes.

Character 1: Then maybe stop forgetting.

1078 Character 2: Oh wow, thanks, never thought of that. Just stop forgetting. [scoff] Why didn't I think of—you know what? You're being really dismissive right now about something that's actually really hard for me.

Character 1: And you're being dismissive about my mom's surgery.

1079 Character 2: I'm not—I'm not dismissing it! I feel terrible that I missed it, honestly I do, but I'm also asking for like, a tiny bit of understanding here? Maybe?

Character 1: Understanding. Right.

1080 Character 2: Yeah, understanding. The thing friends are supposed to have for each other? I mean, I've been dealing with this my whole life and you're acting like it's some personal attack against you.

Character 1: It feels personal when it keeps happening.

1081 Character 2: And that's—okay, I hear that, I do. But I dunno what else to tell you. I'm doing my best, and if that's not enough for you, then... [trails off] I guess that's where we're at.

1082 SCENARIO: attempting to open packaging that won't cooperate

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, I just need to— I just need to open this thing. How hard can it be, right? It's just, uh, it's just cereal. [sigh] But this plastic is, like, welded shut or something.

[slightly strained]

Let me just— let me just try to find the, um, the little tab thing. There's always a tab, right? Or like a— a perforated edge or whatever they call it. [tsk] Nope, that's not— that's not doing anything.

[frustrated but trying to stay calm]

Okay okay okay, maybe I need, uh, maybe I need scissors? But then I have to go find scissors, and I'm already— I'm already standing here with my bowl out, and the milk is just, um, just sitting there getting warm or whatever.

[determined]

You know what, let me just— let me just use my teeth. I know that's probably not, uh, not the most elegant solution, but— [grunt] oh come on, seriously?

[deadpan]

Great. Now I've got plastic shreds in my mouth and the bag is still completely— completely intact. This is, um, this is going well.

[resigned but amused]

Scissors it is, I guess. [laugh] My cereal bowl can wait another two minutes while I go hunt down some basic tools to defeat this, uh, this impenetrable fortress of breakfast food.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 91620059 | Role: Character 1 (A)

1083 Character 1: [concerned] Your eight-year-old was at the park alone yesterday. [voice rising] Did you know that? [Deep breath] I saw him climbing that enormous oak tree with no supervision whatsoever—he could've fallen and seriously hurt himself.

Character 2: [casually] Oh, Tommy loves that tree! [chuckling] He's been climbing it since he was six. [warmly] Kids need space to explore and test their limits, you know? That's how they build confidence and learn risk assessment.

1084 Character 1: [incredulous] Risk assessment? [louder] He's eight! [Scoff] My daughter doesn't leave our yard without me or my husband present. There are strangers everywhere these days, and accidents happen in seconds when nobody's watching them.

Character 2: [gently] I get your concern, really. [more firmly] But we're creating anxious kids who can't problem-solve. [thoughtful pause] Tommy knows our boundaries—stay in the neighborhood, check in every hour. He's thriving with that independence.

1085 Character 1: [sarcastically] Thriving? [Sharp exhale] Last week he rode his bike into traffic chasing a ball! [trembling] What if a car had been coming faster? You can't just hope everything works out when children are involved.

Character 2: [defensive] He looked both ways first—I taught him that. [softer] Look, I grew up roaming freely until sunset, building forts and catching frogs. [wistfully] Those experiences shaped who I am today, made me resilient.

1086 Character 1: [exasperated] Times have changed! [Bitter laugh] We didn't have registered offenders online or distracted drivers on phones. [pleading] Please, at least consider going to the park with him? Other parents are starting to notice and talk.

Character 2: [annoyed] Other parents can mind their own business. [steadier] I watch from the window, and he has a phone for emergencies. [Sigh] Helicopter parenting creates dependent adults who can't handle real-world challenges later.

1087 Character 1: [hurt] Helicopter parenting? [voice cracking] I'm protecting my child! [more intensely] When something terrible happens—and statistics show it will—you'll wish you'd been more careful. Safety isn't negotiable when it comes to our babies.

Character 2: [sympathetically] I understand you're scared. [measured tone] But statistics also show kids today are safer than ever. [passionate] What about their mental health? Independence, outdoor play, and calculated risks are crucial for healthy development, aren't they?

1088 Character 1: [shakily] Mental health matters, yes, but so does physical safety. [growing firmer] There's a middle ground here. [Frustrated groan] Why not gradual independence with check-ins? Start with supervised freedom, then slowly expand their boundaries as they mature?

Character 2: [considering] That's actually not unreasonable. [more thoughtfully] Maybe I could be at the park sometimes, just sitting on a bench reading. [lighter] Tommy would still feel independent, but you'd feel better knowing an adult's nearby.

1089 Character 1: [relieved] Yes, exactly! [warmer tone] And perhaps our kids could play together sometimes? [hopefully] My Sarah needs more outdoor time, honestly. She's always asking to join Tommy's adventures but I've been too worried.

Character 2: [enthusiastically] That's a great idea! [Soft laugh] Tommy would love a partner in crime. [more seriously] How about we start with short supervised trips together? Then we can gradually give them more freedom as you feel comfortable.

1090 Character 1: [hesitant] I suppose we could try that. [steadying] But ground rules first—no tree climbing above ten feet, no leaving the park boundaries. [quickly] And they both need phones or watches to contact us immediately.

Character 2: [agreeably] Fair enough, we'll compromise. [amused tone] Ten feet is reasonable for starting out. [Chuckle] Though I bet within a month you'll be letting Sarah go higher once you see how capable she really is.

1091 Character 1: [defensively] We'll see about that. [softer] I admit, she has been asking for more independence lately. [Nervous laugh] Maybe I have been a bit overprotective. It's just so hard to let go sometimes.

Character 2: [understanding] Parenting is terrifying, I get it. [reassuring tone] But watching them grow confident and capable? [warmly] That's worth the anxiety. Let's try this Saturday—park playdate at ten, and we'll both be there.

1092 Character 1: [resigned] Saturday at ten it is. [more firmly] But I'm bringing hand sanitizer and a first aid kit. [Slight laugh] And don't judge me if I hover for the first few visits, okay?

Character 2: [laughing] Deal! Bring whatever makes you comfortable. [teasingly] I'll bring snacks and bandaids. [sincere] Look, we're both doing our best here. Our kids are lucky to have parents who care this much.

Script: c07d494e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Hi, um, I just installed my new SmartGuard Pro 2000 doorbell camera yesterday, model number SG2K-4B7X. [hesitantly] The manual keeps mentioning these "detection zones" but I—I honestly have no idea what that even means or how to set them up properly.

1093 Customer Support: Good afternoon! I can definitely help you with that. [reassuring] Let me just pull up your account—can you provide your customer ID number? Detection zones are basically areas where you want the camera to specifically monitor for motion, like your driveway or walkway.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh, okay, my ID is... [pause] let me see... CUS-847392-M. [curiously] So wait, does that mean it won't detect motion everywhere it can see? My driveway is at 42 Maple Street and goes pretty far back.

1094 Customer Support: [acknowledging] Perfect, I've got your account here, thank you. The camera can see everything in its 160-degree field of view, but you can create up to 5 customizable zones. This helps reduce false alerts from, say, trees swaying or cars passing on the street.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh! That makes so much more sense now. [frustrated] Because last night it kept alerting me every time a car drove by—probably sent me like 47 notifications between midnight and 3 AM. [groans] I barely slept.

1095 Customer Support: Oh, that sounds really frustrating, I'm sorry about that. [helpfully] Let's set up your zones right now through the app—do you have version 3.2.1 installed? We'll create zones just for your property boundaries at 42 Maple Street.

Character 1: [checking] Um, let me check... yeah, version 3.2.1, got it. [confused again] But when I tap on "zones" it shows this weird grid thing with numbers like Z1, Z2, all the way to Z5. [sighs] Should I just randomly select squares?

1096 Customer Support: No, no, don't worry, it's actually quite intuitive once you know how. Each zone, Z1 through Z5, can be shaped by dragging the corners to cover specific areas. Think of it like drawing a box around only the areas you care about monitoring.

Character 1: [concentrating] Okay, so I'm dragging now and—oh wow, it's actually working! [excitedly] I've got Zone 1 covering my front door and Zone 2 on the driveway. [questioning] But what about sensitivity settings? Mine shows 75% for each zone.

1097 Customer Support: Excellent work! You're getting the hang of it. The 75% sensitivity is our default, but for driveways I usually recommend dropping it to about 60% to avoid triggering from small animals. Unless you want alerts every time a squirrel runs by.

Character 1: [laughing] Definitely not the squirrels! There's like a whole family of them in my oak tree. [more seriously] So I'll set driveway to 60%, keep the door at 75%. [pause] What about the package detection zone—is that different from regular zones?

1098 Customer Support: Great question! Package detection is actually a separate AI feature that works within your zones. [explaining] Once you enable it in settings under PD-001, it'll specifically look for package-shaped objects. It's especially useful if you get lots of deliveries to 42 Maple Street.

Character 1: [interested] Oh, that's perfect because I probably get like 3 or 4 Amazon deliveries a week. [typing sounds] Okay, enabling PD-001 now... [confused briefly] Wait, it's asking for a verification code?

1099 Customer Support: That's normal for the premium features—check your email for code starting with VER-. It should have been sent to the email on file when you registered your SG2K-4B7X yesterday. [reassuring] Sometimes it goes to spam, so check there too.

Character 1: [searching] Let me look... spam folder, spam folder... [triumphantly] Found it! VER-9847-XKPA. [relieved sigh] Okay, package detection is now active. This is actually way easier than I thought it would be.

1100 Customer Support: Wonderful! You've done a fantastic job setting everything up. Just remember, it takes about 24-48 hours for the AI to learn your specific property patterns at 42 Maple. So you might still get a few extra alerts initially.

Character 1: [understanding] That makes sense, like it needs to learn what's normal for my house. [gratefully] Thank you so much for walking me through this—I was about ready to return the whole thing! [chuckles] My reference number is still CUS-847392-M, right?

1101 Customer Support: Yes, that's your permanent customer ID, keep that handy. I'm also sending you our quick reference guide to your email—document QRG-2024-ZONES. It has pictures showing different zone setup examples that might help even more.

Character 1: [appreciatively] Perfect, I love having visual guides! [curiously] One last thing—if I want to temporarily disable a zone, like when I'm doing yard work, can I do that? [hopefully] Without having to redraw everything later?

1102 Customer Support: [confidently] Absolutely! Just toggle the zone on or off using the switches next to Z1 through Z5 in your app. [reassuringly] Your settings stay saved, so you can reactivate anytime. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your SmartGuard Pro 2000 today?

1103 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Riverside Credit Union, this is Sarah speaking. How may I assist you with your account today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my loan application—it's been three weeks now. [sighs heavily] I submitted everything you asked for, but I haven't heard anything back, and I really need to know what's going on.

1104 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account right away—could you provide me your member number and last name please? [more reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out for you.

Character 1: [impatiently] It's Morrison, account 445-78-9021. [quieter] Look, I was told it would take five business days maximum, and now I'm... I'm getting worried because I need this for my house closing next week.

1105 Customer Support: Thank you Mr. Morrison, I'm seeing your application here. It appears there was a—well, a discrepancy with your employment verification form. Our underwriting team sent a request for additional documentation last Tuesday.

Character 1: [shocked] What? I never received any email or call about this! [louder] How was I supposed to know you needed more papers when nobody bothered to contact me?

1106 Customer Support: Let me check the contact log here... Shows we sent it to the email on file ending in gmail-dot-com. Sometimes these messages do end up in spam folders unfortunately.

Character 1: [groans] Of course it did—I just checked and there it is. [defeated] But even if I send this today, there's no way it'll be processed in time, is there? My closing is literally in four days.

1107 Customer Support: Actually, Mr. Morrison, I can help expedite this. If you can email those documents within the next hour, I'll personally walk them to underwriting. We offer priority processing for time-sensitive closings.

Character 1: [skeptically] Priority processing? Why wasn't I told about this before? [sighs] What exactly do you need from me, and... and how much extra is this going to cost?

1108 Customer Support: No additional charge for members in your situation, sir. Just need the updated pay stubs from the last sixty days and a letter from HR confirming your position. I'll stay on to confirm receipt.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank God, okay, I can—I can get those from my office right now. [hurriedly] Should I use the same email address from before, or is there a direct line to avoid the spam filter mess?

1109 Customer Support: Use loans-urgent at riverside-c-u dot org—that comes straight to me. Put your member number in the subject line, and I'll confirm within five minutes of receiving them. We'll make this deadline work.

Character 1: [gratefully] You have no idea how much this means, Sarah. [chuckles nervously] I was about to lose my mind thinking the whole house deal would fall through over some missing paperwork.

1110 Customer Support: That's what we're here for, Mr. Morrison. [speaking rapidly] Once I receive your documents, underwriting typically takes twenty-four hours for priority cases. You should have your approval letter by Wednesday morning latest.

Character 1: [cautiously] And if there are any other issues? [worried] I mean, I can't handle another surprise—my seller isn't exactly the patient type, you know?

1111 Customer Support: [firmly] I'll personally monitor your application through completion. My direct extension is 4-5-2 if you need anything, and I'm here until six-thirty today. We've handled tighter deadlines than this successfully.

Character 1: [exhales] Alright, sending the documents now—just got them from HR. [anxiously] You'll really confirm you got them? Because I'm refreshing my email like a madman over here.

1112 Customer Support: And... perfect, just received them Mr. Morrison. Everything looks complete—I'm walking these to underwriting right now while we're still on the phone. Expect an update by tomorrow afternoon.

Character 1: [relieved] Sarah, you're an absolute lifesaver, seriously. [chuckles] Next time I'll check my spam folder before panicking—lesson learned the hard way, right?

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1113 [Sad] I don't—I don't understand, you said the tests were just routine, right? [Slow] This can't be happening.

1114 [Angry] No, no, you've gotta be looking at someone else's results because I feel completely fine! [Fast] Check again!

1115 [Whisper] Um, should I... should I call my wife now or wait until I get home? [Sigh]

1116 [Disappointed] [Slow] So all those years of eating kale and running marathons were just—what, pointless?

1117 [Happy] Wait, you're joking, right? [Laugh] This is like one of those hidden camera things my kids watch!

1118 [Fast] Okay so how long do I have to—actually, don't answer that yet, I need a minute. [Groan]

1119 [Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect timing, really, 'cause I just booked a non-refundable cruise. [Tsk]

1120 [Sad] My mom went through this same thing and she, um... [Whisper] she didn't make it.

1121 [Shout] I want a second opinion! [Angry] I want three opinions, actually!

1122 [Slow] Can you just, like, explain it again but use smaller words this time? [Disappointed] I'm kinda lost here.

1123 [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Sarcastic] I literally just paid off my student loans yesterday—thirty years of payments.

1124 [Fast] [Whisper] Is this the kind of thing where I gotta quit my job or can I still work?

1125 [Sad] I promised my daughter I'd walk her down the aisle and she's not even engaged yet. [Sigh]

1126 [Angry] This is—no, I'm gonna sue somebody, the insurance company or whoever missed this! [Groan]

1127 [Happy] Honestly? [Chuckle] Part of me is relieved 'cause at least now I know why I've been feeling so weird.

1128 [Slow] [Disappointed] So basically you're telling me Christmas might be... different this year, huh?

1129 [Whisper] I haven't even told my kids about the divorce yet and now there's—God, this is too much. [Tsk]

1130 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, sure, let's just pile it all on at once, why not throw in a meteor strike while we're at it?

1131 [Sad] But Doctor, I just turned thirty, I mean, this isn't supposed to happen to people like—to people my age. [Slow]

1132 [Shout] Don't touch me! [Angry] [Fast] I need to get out of here, I can't breathe in this stupid little room!

1133 SCENARIO: Lightheartedly talking about unfollowing someone, then checking if they noticed, then seeing they've unfollowed back and subtweeted about it, ending in social media regret

==================================================

[casual]

So you know how Sarah's been posting like twenty Instagram stories a day about her juice cleanse? [light laugh] I finally just— I unfollowed her. Like, I still follow her main account, but I muted her stories because I cannot see one more photo of green sludge, you know?

[conversational]

And then of course I got curious, right? Like, does she notice when people unfollow? So I may have... checked her follower count a couple times today. [sheepish] Which is ridiculous, I know, but I was bored.

[a bit concerned]

But then I noticed she unfollowed me back? Which, okay, fine, whatever, that's fair I guess. People notice these things apparently.

[more worried]

And I'm scrolling through Twitter and— oh wait. [pause] Wait, hold on, she just posted something. "Some people really show their true colors when you're trying to better yourself." [nervous laugh] 

[anxious]

That's— that's about me, right? Oh god, that's definitely about me. The timing is too weird. She's subtweeting about unfollowing her stupid juice stories!

[spiraling]

[groan] Why did I even do that? Now I look like some bitter friend who can't handle her wellness journey or whatever. This is so much worse than just seeing the smoothie posts! Ugh, I've become Instagram drama! [exasperated] Over juice!
