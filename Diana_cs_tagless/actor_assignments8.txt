Script: 5e259344_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I got cast in that indie film.

646 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? The one you auditioned for like, last month? Oh my god, I thought you said it was a long shot! This is—this is huge!

Character 1: Yeah. I start next week.

647 Character 2: Next WEEK? Okay, um, why are you being so casual about this? [Laugh] Like, you're literally gonna be in a movie! What's your role? Is it the—was it the one you wanted?

Character 1: Supporting lead. The sister character.

648 Character 2: The sister! Yes! I remember you talking about her, she had that whole like, complicated backstory thing, right? With the—wait, doesn't she have all those emotional scenes?

Character 1: Three crying scenes. I don't cry on command.

649 Character 2: Oh. Oh no, okay but—but they cast you, right? So obviously they think you can do it. Maybe they'll use like, fake tears or something? I dunno how that works honestly.

Character 1: Maybe.

650 Character 2: Are you—hold on, are you actually nervous? Because that's so normal, like completely completely normal. I'd be [Groan] terrified probably. But also excited? Are you excited at all?

Character 1: I don't know. It's weird. Everything feels different now.

651 Character 2: Different how? Like, good different or... oh god, you're not gonna back out are you? Because this is—I mean, this is kinda what you've been working toward forever.

Character 1: No. Just... what if I'm terrible?

652 Character 2: Okay no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You got cast for a reason, they saw like, hundreds of people probably and they picked YOU. [Softer] That means something, y'know?

Character 1: My parents think I should keep my day job.

653 Character 2: Oh man, of course they—ugh, sorry, that's frustrating. But like, can you do both? The filming schedule, is it gonna conflict with work?

Character 1: Three weeks of nights and weekends. It'll be exhausting.

654 Character 2: Three weeks of—okay yeah, that's... that's actually brutal. But also? Kinda badass that you're gonna do it anyway. Have you told anyone else yet or am I like, the first to know? [Laugh]

Character 1: Just you. Haven't even told my roommate.

655 Character 2: Wait, really? I'm—oh my god, I'm so honored. Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating this weekend, and I don't wanna hear any of your "it's not a big deal" stuff because it absolutely is.

Script: 9badedca_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Nice photo you posted.

656 Character 2: Oh! Um, which—wait, are you talking about the one from last night? I thought it was cute! You looked so happy and I just wanted to—oh no. Oh no no no, you're mad.

Character 1: That was private.

657 Character 2: I didn't—I mean, I didn't think it was that big of a deal? Like, it was just you at the party and—[nervous laugh] okay yeah, I can see your face right now and I'm realizing I really messed up.

Character 1: You tagged my location. While I was supposedly at work.

658 Character 2: Oh god. Oh my god, I didn't even—I wasn't thinking about that. I just, you know how I get when I post, I just kinda autopilot and tag everyone and—shit, did your boss see it?

Character 1: Take a guess.

659 Character 2: I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. I can take it down! I'll take it down right now, hold on, let me just— [groan] Okay it's gone. It's deleted.

Character 1: Bit late for that.

660 Character 2: I know, I know, but maybe—maybe we can tell them you were on lunch? Or that it was an old photo? I mean, technically you were gonna leave work early anyway, right? That's what you told me—not that that makes it okay! I'm not saying it's okay.

Character 1: Three hundred people saw it. Including my entire family.

661 Character 2: Wait, your family? But I thought—oh. Oh no, was this the day you told them you were visiting your aunt? I—god, I really just ruined everything, didn't I? I'm such an idiot sometimes, I swear I don't think before I—

Character 1: Sometimes?

662 Character 2: Okay, fine, a lot of the time. Most of the time? I just get excited and wanna share stuff and I forget that not everyone—that's not an excuse though. I should've asked you first. I always forget to ask.

Character 1: You never think about consequences.

663 Character 2: You're right. You're—you're completely right and I hate that about myself, honestly. Like my mom says the same thing and usually I just brush it off but [sigh] when it hurts people I care about—when it hurts you—I just feel like garbage.

Character 1: This isn't the first time.

664 Character 2: I know. Remember the group chat thing? And the—the birthday surprise I ruined? God, why do you even keep me around? I'm basically a walking disaster who can't keep her mouth shut, online or offline.

Character 1: Because you're my friend. Somehow.

665 Character 2: I am. I'm your friend who's gonna—who's gonna do better, I promise. Like, actually promise this time. Maybe you could, um, maybe check my posts before I hit send? Like a filter? I dunno, whatever helps. I just—I really don't wanna lose you over my stupid social media habits.

Script: 2e3d09e0_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You just sat there.

666 Character 2: I—okay, wait, that's not exactly how it went down. I was trying to figure out if you wanted me to jump in or if that would've made things worse with your mom.

Character 1: I looked right at you.

667 Character 2: Yeah, and I didn't know what that meant! Was it like "help me" or "please don't make this worse"? You know how your family gets when outsiders—when other people get involved. [Sigh] I've seen it happen before.

Character 1: So you did nothing.

668 Character 2: That's—no, that's not fair. I tried to change the subject like three times. I literally brought up the weather, which was super awkward, but I was trying to give you an out without overstepping.

Character 1: They were attacking me.

669 Character 2: I know, I know, and that sucked to watch, honestly it did. But you're acting like I—look, last time I defended you to your dad, you told me afterwards that I made everything ten times worse, remember?

Character 1: That was different.

670 Character 2: How? How was it different? Because from where I'm sitting, it's like—I can't win here. [frustrated laugh] Either I'm overstepping or I'm not doing enough, and I never know which one you want until after.

Character 1: You could've asked.

671 Character 2: In front of your whole family? Like, "Hey, excuse me everyone, should I defend my friend right now?" Come on. That would've been—you know that would've been weird.

Character 1: Weirder than abandoning me?

672 Character 2: Okay okay, that's—I didn't abandon you. That word is kinda harsh, don't you think? I was literally sitting right there, trying to figure out how to help without making your mom go completely nuclear on both of us.

Character 1: You're my best friend.

673 Character 2: And you're mine, which is why I—ugh, this is so frustrating. I'm sorry I didn't handle it perfectly, alright? But I was genuinely trying not to make your situation worse. That's gotta count for something.

Character 1: Does it?

674 Character 2: I mean... yeah? I think it should? Look look, I get that you're hurt, and maybe I should've—I dunno, done something different. [Scoff] But you're not even acknowledging that I was in an impossible position here.

Character 1: I needed you.

675 Character 2: And I was there! Just not—not in the exact way you wanted, apparently. But I was there, and I'm here now, even though you're basically treating me like I'm the enemy when your family's the one who—whatever. This is exhausting.

Script: dd16d357_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You always have to be right.

676 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's literally not true. I don't always have to be right, I just... when I know something, I say it. There's a difference.

Character 1: Name one time you admitted you were wrong.

677 Character 2: Seriously? You're gonna make me—fine, remember last month when we were arguing about that movie thing? I said you were right about the director. [scoff] But apparently that doesn't count now.

Character 1: After googling it for twenty minutes.

678 Character 2: So what? I still admitted it, didn't I? Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here, but like... if I think something's true, I'm gonna say it. That's not me being stubborn, that's just—that's just being honest.

Character 1: It's exhausting.

679 Character 2: Okay okay, but you're acting like I do this to annoy you on purpose. I don't! I genuinely—when I say something, it's because I believe it's right. Would you rather I just... pretend to be wrong when I'm not?

Character 1: Sometimes, yeah.

680 Character 2: That's—wow. [frustrated laugh] So you want me to lie? Just nod along and agree with everything even when I know it's not accurate? That's not who I am, y'know?

Character 1: Not everything's a debate.

681 Character 2: And I get that, I do, but you're making it sound like I turn everything into an argument when really I'm just—I'm trying to help. Like, if you're wrong about something, wouldn't you wanna know?

Character 1: Not from you. Not anymore.

682 Character 2: That's... that's actually really hurtful. Look look, I know I can be—intense or whatever, but I'm not doing it to make you feel stupid. That's never been the point.

Character 1: Feels like it is.

683 Character 2: Well it's not, okay? It's not. And honestly? You're kinda doing the same thing right now—deciding you're right about my intentions without even listening to what I'm saying.

Character 1: That's different.

684 Character 2: How? How is it different? Because from where I'm sitting, you've already decided I'm this horrible person who has to win every argument, and nothing I say is gonna change your mind. [sigh] Which is pretty ironic if you think about it.

Character 1: I just want a friend, not a fact-checker.

685 Character 2: And I—I am your friend. Or I'm trying to be. But I can't just turn off my brain, y'know? I can't pretend not to know things. Maybe that makes me annoying, but it's also just... me.

Script: ce3eaf14_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I saw you with Alex last night.

686 Character 2: Oh. Oh no. Wait wait wait, that wasn't—okay I know how it looked but I swear it wasn't what you think. We were just talking about the project and then—I mean, yeah, we were laughing but that's just—

Character 1: You were touching their arm.

687 Character 2: I was? I—okay maybe I was but like, you know how I am, right? I'm just naturally touchy with everyone and I didn't even realize—[nervous laugh] god, I'm such an idiot. I wasn't thinking about it like that at all.

Character 1: You knew I liked them.

688 Character 2: I know. I know I knew, and that's—that's the worst part. I just got caught up in the conversation and honestly, Alex was being really funny and I kinda forgot to—no, that sounds terrible. I didn't forget, I just wasn't being careful enough.

Character 1: Really funny, huh.

689 Character 2: No no no, not like—I didn't mean it like that. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I absolutely was not trying to flirt with them. Like, I have zero interest in Alex that way, I promise you.

Character 1: Could've fooled me. And apparently Alex too.

690 Character 2: Wait, what? What do you mean? Did they—did they say something to you? Oh god, if they think I was hitting on them—okay this is bad. This is really really bad and I'm gonna fix it, I swear.

Character 1: How exactly are you going to fix it?

691 Character 2: I'll talk to them! I'll—I'll make it super clear that I'm not interested and actually, y'know what? I'll tell them how amazing you are. Like casually drop it into conversation that you're—wait, is that weird? That might be weird. But I wanna help somehow.

Character 1: Don't. Just... don't make it worse.

692 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right. I should just—I should back off completely, shouldn't I? [sigh] God, I really messed this up for you. I'm so so sorry. I never wanted to get in the way of—of whatever could happen between you two.

Character 1: I was going to ask them out this weekend.

693 Character 2: You were? Oh man, you still should! Honestly, you really really should because I don't think—look, from what I could tell, Alex seems pretty interested in you too. They kept asking about you actually, which I probably should've mentioned earlier but—

Character 1: They asked about me?

694 Character 2: Yeah! Like multiple times! They wanted to know what kinda music you're into and if you were dating anyone and—oh my god, I'm literally the worst friend ever for not putting two and two together. They were totally fishing for info about you.

Character 1: Why didn't you tell me this before?

695 Character 2: Because I'm an idiot? Because I was too busy being my usual chatty self to realize what was happening? I dunno, I just—[nervous laugh] I guess I was so worried about looking like I was flirting that I didn't notice they were basically interviewing me about you. Still gonna ask them out?

696 SCENARIO: realizing they left their loyalty card at home

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh, come on. Come on, where is— I know I have it somewhere. The, um, the little card thing for— [sigh] I literally just need the stupid loyalty card and I— wait, did I even bring my wallet?

[slightly panicked]

Okay, okay, wallet's here, that's good. But the card is— it's not in the, uh, it's not in the little slot where I usually— [groan] Oh no. Oh no no no, I think I left it on the kitchen counter.

[resigned but still searching]

Maybe it's loose in here somewhere? Like, maybe it just, um, maybe it fell out or something? Let me just— no, that's a receipt. That's another receipt. Why do I have so many— [tsk] this is just grocery receipts from like three weeks ago.

[defeated]

Yeah, no, it's definitely at home. Sitting right there on the counter next to the, uh, next to the coffee maker where I left it like an idiot. [exhale] Great planning, really.

[brightening slightly]

But wait, can't I just, um— don't they have like an app now? Or I could just give them my phone number, right? That's— that's a thing they do now.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 6984f796 | Role: Character 1 (A)

697 Character 1: [trembling voice] I keep thinking this isn't real, that tomorrow you'll still be here. [Shaky breath] We've been through everything together since we were kids, and now [voice breaking] I don't know how to do this without you.

Character 2: [quietly] Hey, come here. [warm but sad] It's not forever—eighteen months will fly by, I promise. [Deep sigh] Remember when we thought summer camp was the end of the world? This is just [pause] a longer version of that.

698 Character 1: [bitter laugh] Summer camp didn't involve bullets and bombs. [more desperately] What if something happens and I never get to tell you how much you mean to me? [Choked sob] What if our last conversation is about something stupid?

Character 2: [firmly] Nothing's going to happen to me. [softer now] But if it makes you feel better, let's promise—no stupid conversations from here on out. [slight chuckle] Though technically, that eliminates about ninety percent of what we usually talk about together.

699 Character 1: [through tears] Remember the treehouse? [nostalgic whisper] We swore we'd live there forever, just the two of us against the world. [Sniffling] Sometimes I wish we could go back to being eight and believing that was actually possible.

Character 2: [wistfully] I still have that terrible drawing we made of it. [getting thicker] The one where we gave it rocket boosters? [voice cracking] God, I'm taking it with me—need something to remind me what I'm fighting to come back to.

700 Character 1: [suddenly urgent] Promise me you'll write. [rapid words] Real letters, not just emails—something I can hold when everything feels too empty here. [pleading] Even if it's just one line saying you're okay, that you're still you.

Character 2: [steadier] Every week, without fail. [in measured tones] I'll tell you about the boring stuff too—what I ate, how hot it is, [softer] all the mundane details that'll make you roll your eyes and feel normal.

701 Character 1: [angry suddenly] This is so unfair! [louder] Why does it have to be you? There are millions of people in this country. [Breaking down] But no, my best friend has to be the hero. [Bitter sob] I hate this.

Character 2: [gently] I'm not trying to be a hero. [more seriously] Someone has to do it, and I'd rather it be me than someone who has nobody waiting for them. [pause] At least I know I have something worth coming home for.

702 Character 1: [hollow whisper] Your mom made me promise to look after your dog. [trying to smile] Like I wouldn't have stolen him anyway. [voice wobbling] He's going to sleep on your pillow every night until you come back to claim him properly.

Character 2: [laughing weakly] He'll be so spoiled by then. [more emotional] Thank you for that, for taking care of things here. [quieter] It makes leaving a tiny bit easier, knowing you'll keep my life warm for me while I'm gone.

703 Character 1: [desperate] What if you change? [faster] What if the person who comes back isn't the one who left? [Ragged breath] What if we can't find our way back to this, to us, to everything we've built together here?

Character 2: [confidently] The core of me isn't going anywhere. [thoughtful tone] Yeah, I might see things that change me, but [firmly] the part that's your best friend? That's carved in stone. [whispered] That's the part I'll protect most over there.

704 Character 1: [exhausted] I brought you something. [rustling sounds] It's stupid, just that keychain from the arcade—[voice lifting] remember when we spent forty dollars trying to win it? [Soft laugh] Figured you could use some good luck from our misspent youth.

Character 2: [touched] Are you kidding? This is perfect. [getting emotional] I can't believe you kept it all these years. [Shaky exhale] Now I'll have to come back—can't leave you without your half of our legendary arcade victory, can I?

705 Character 1: [suddenly clear] When you come back, we're taking that road trip. [building energy] No excuses, no delays—straight to the coast like we always planned. [fiercely] Two weeks of terrible music and gas station coffee, and absolutely no talk about any of this.

Character 2: [matching energy] Deal. You better start making the playlist now. [lighter] I want twenty hours of music minimum, and at least [chuckling] three songs that'll make us cry for good reasons. [pause] Happy tears only on that trip, agreed?

706 Character 1: [breaking completely] I love you, you know that right? [through sobs] Not romantically, just—you're my person, my family. [gasping] The thought of this world without you in it makes me feel like I'm drowning in advance.

Character 2: [voice thick] I love you too. [pulling together] And hey, I'm too stubborn to not come back. [watery laugh] You're stuck with me for at least sixty more years. [whispered promise] This is just a chapter, not the ending.

707 Character 1: [shouting] What do you mean my daughter has a broken arm?! [voice cracking] I dropped her off at 8:15 this morning perfectly fine, and now you're telling me she's at—at Memorial Hospital on 2847 Oak Street?!

Customer Support: D2: [apologetically] Mrs. Henderson, I understand you're upset. [steadier] Emma fell from the playground equipment around 10:30 AM, and we immediately called 911. [softer] Your emergency contact, your mother I believe, is already with her.

708 Character 1: [furiously] The playground equipment? [louder] Which one exactly, because I specifically filled out form 23-B stating she wasn't allowed on the climbing tower! [voice trembling] This is completely unacceptable!

Customer Support: D4: [nervously] Actually, it was the—the smaller slide structure, not the tower. [more calmly] According to our incident report number INJ-4521, she was going down backwards when another child accidentally bumped into her.

709 Character 1: [incredulous] Backwards?! [shouting] Where was the supervision? [sarcastically] Don't I pay $1,850 a month for you people to actually watch these kids?

Customer Support: D6: [defensive] Ms. Rodriguez was supervising, she has—has over 12 years of experience. [more firmly] The ratio was 1 to 6, well within state regulations. [quieter] Sometimes accidents just happen despite our best efforts.

710 Character 1: [voice breaking] Don't give me that! [more angrily] I want to see the security footage from cameras 3 and 4 in the playground area. [demanding] And I want copies of every single staff certification by tomorrow morning!

Customer Support: D8: [hesitant] The footage can be reviewed but, um, you'll need to submit a formal request to our main office at 5500 Wilshire Boulevard. [more confidently] However, I can email you the incident documentation right now to your registered email.

711 Character 1: [bitterly] Oh, how convenient, more paperwork! [louder] My four-year-old is in the hospital with a fractured radius, and you're worried about—about protocols? [scoffs] This is lawsuit material, you understand that?

Customer Support: D10: [pleading] Mrs. Henderson, please, we're—we're devastated this happened. [more sincerely] Our insurance claim number is already filed as CLM-789-2024A. [gently] Right now though, shouldn't you be heading to the hospital to be with Emma?

712 Character 1: [quieter] I'm already in my car, doing 75 on Interstate 405! [voice shaking] But don't think this conversation is over. [firmly] I want a meeting with the director Monday at 9 AM sharp!

Customer Support: D12: [relieved] Of course, I'll—I'll schedule that with Director Johnson immediately. [more professionally] She'll be in our conference room B at that time. [warmly] Please give Emma our best wishes for a speedy recovery.

713 Character 1: [sarcastically] Your best wishes? [louder] That's really helpful right now! [sighs heavily] Just have all the documentation ready, including Teacher Rodriguez's file and that other child's information.

Customer Support: D14: [cautiously] We can't release other children's information due to privacy laws, but, um, everything else will be prepared. [more assertively] The full report, staff schedules from today, and our safety inspection records from last month.

714 Character 1: [frustrated] Privacy laws! [groans] My baby is hurt and you're protecting the kid who caused this? [more controlled] Fine, but I want the parents contacted—room 4B, the Mitchell boy, right?

Customer Support: D16: [uncomfortably] I—I can't confirm any names, Mrs. Henderson. [steadier] But all involved parties' parents have been notified per our policy 7.3.2. [sympathetically] I know this is incredibly difficult for you.

715 Character 1: [exhausted] You have no idea. [voice cracking] She's four years old, she was so excited about show-and-tell today, brought her—her favorite stuffed unicorn. [sniffling] Now she's getting X-rays instead.

Customer Support: D18: [gently] We actually saved her unicorn, it's—it's safe in her cubby number 27. [more warmly] Ms. Rodriguez said Emma was very brave when it happened. [reassuringly] She even helped calm down the other children who were scared.

716 Character 1: [softer] She did? [sighs] That sounds like my Emma. [more firmly] Look, I'm pulling into the hospital now, parking garage level C-3. [determined] But this isn't over, not by a long shot.

Customer Support: D20: [understanding] Absolutely, we'll discuss everything on Monday. [sincerely] The incident report will be in your inbox within the hour, case reference DC-20241108-EM. [quietly] Please take care, Mrs. Henderson, and—and give Emma a hug from all of us.

Script: 969122ab | Role: Customer Support

717 Customer Support: Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your recent premium notice. Yes, I can definitely help explain the increase—let me just pull up your account here and, um, we can go through everything together.

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I've been with you guys for twelve years, twelve! [voice rising] My premium just jumped forty percent and I—I haven't even filed a claim. [sighs heavily] How is this even justified?

718 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, truly. The increase is actually market-wide—we've seen rising repair costs, medical expenses are up thirty percent, and unfortunately these factors affect everyone's rates.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, so everyone's suffering equally. [slower] That really doesn't help when I'm already stretched between my mortgage and, well, [exhausted] everything else that's gone up this year.

719 Customer Support: You're absolutely right, everything's more expensive now. Let me check what discounts we can apply—are you still, um, working from home? [hopeful] We have new low-mileage options that could save you fifteen percent.

Character 1: [skeptically] Fifteen percent off of what though? [groans] The new inflated price? [quieter] I work from home three days a week now, but that's still—that's still not making this affordable.

720 Customer Support: Actually, three days qualifies you for our hybrid work discount! [more enthusiastically] Plus, if you bundle with homeowners—wait, do you have that with us? We could potentially get you back closer to your original rate.

Character 1: [tired] My homeowner's is with State Farm. [sighs] I suppose I could switch, but [reluctantly] that sounds like such a hassle right now, transferring everything over.

721 Customer Support: It's actually much easier than you'd think! We handle all the paperwork, coordinate the switch date, and—here's the thing—bundling would save you about [calculating] two hundred monthly across both policies.

Character 1: [surprised] Two hundred? [pause] That's... actually significant. [cautiously optimistic] But what's the catch here—are you cutting coverage or raising deductibles without telling me?

722 Customer Support: No catch, same coverage levels exactly. The savings come from the multi-policy discount, plus that hybrid work reduction, and honestly, we really value long-term customers like yourself.

Character 1: [considering] Alright, so if I'm understanding correctly... [trails off] Wait, would this lock me into some long contract? [worried] Because I don't want to be stuck if rates jump again next year.

723 Customer Support: No long-term contracts whatsoever! You can adjust or cancel anytime—we keep customers by, you know, actually providing value. Not by trapping them with contracts.

Character 1: [relieved] Well that's refreshing, I guess. [sighs] Can you email me the exact numbers? [more firmly] I need to see everything spelled out before I make any decisions here.

724 Customer Support: Absolutely, I'm preparing that right now actually. I'll include both the standalone auto rate and the bundled option, with all applicable discounts itemized—should be in your inbox within five minutes.

Character 1: [appreciatively] Thank you, that's helpful. [pause] One more thing though—what about my daughter? [concerned] She's getting her license next month and I'm dreading what that'll do to the premium.

725 Customer Support: Perfect timing to ask! We have a good student discount, defensive driving course credits, and if she's using a car with our safe-drive monitoring app, that's another ten to fifteen percent off her portion.

Character 1: [skeptically] Monitoring app? [groans softly] You mean tracking her every move? [resigned] I suppose that's just how things are now—no privacy for anyone anymore.

726 Customer Support: I understand the concern about privacy, really. The app only tracks driving behaviors—speed, braking, that sort of thing—not locations or destinations. [quickly] It's completely optional but the savings are substantial.

Character 1: [decisively] Alright, send me everything—the quotes, the app information, all of it. [sighs] I'll review it with my husband tonight and [somewhat defeated] probably call you back tomorrow to switch everything over.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

727 [Slow] I'm just gonna, um, close my eyes for like one second—just to rest them, you know? [Yawn] Not sleeping, definitely not sleeping.

728 [Fast] Wait, who's that guy again? [Confused] Is he the—no, that's the other one, right?

729 [Whisper] If I fall asleep, just, uh, elbow me or something, okay? [Chuckle] But like, gently.

730 [Angry] This movie is so damn slow—I mean, honestly, when does something actually happen? [Groan]

731 [Happy] Oh! Oh, this is the good part! [Fast] I'm awake, I'm totally awake now!

732 [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm riveted by this, uh, ten-minute establishing shot of a building. [Tsk]

733 Maybe I should get some—actually, you know what, I'm gonna grab another coffee real quick.

734 [Disappointed] I really wanted to like this one, but it's just... [Sigh] it's kind of a slog, isn't it?

735 [Shout] What?! [Fast] No way, I wasn't sleeping—I was just, um, resting my neck!

736 [Slow] The cinematography is really... really beautiful though, I guess. [Yawn] Very... artistic.

737 How much longer is this thing anyway—like, are we halfway through or...?

738 [Sad] I'm sorry, I know you were excited about this one, but I'm just—I'm struggling here. [Sigh]

739 [Fast] [Laugh] Did I just snore? Please tell me I didn't just snore in the theater!

740 [Whisper] [Slow] Everything feels so heavy right now, like my eyelids weigh a thousand pounds or something.

741 I'm gonna try that thing where you, uh, pinch yourself—does that actually work? [Groan]

742 [Happy] [Chuckle] You know what, let's just make fun of it—that'll keep me entertained at least!

743 [Sarcastic] [Disappointed] Great, another dream sequence—or wait, is this real? I honestly can't tell anymore.

744 [Angry] [Fast] Why do they keep the theater so warm and cozy? It's like they want people to pass out!

745 This popcorn is literally the only thing keeping me conscious right now. [Chuckle]

746 [Sad] [Whisper] I feel so bad, but I just—I cannot follow what's happening anymore, my brain is like, completely gone.

747 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly recounting a shortcut they took driving, then remembering a camera they passed, then wondering if they ran a red light, ending in ticket anxiety

==================================================

[casual]

So I took that back route through downtown today, you know the one that cuts behind the mall? Saved me like ten minutes, which was great because I was already running late for my appointment.

[matter-of-fact]

There was this one intersection where I had to gun it a little bit because the light was changing, but whatever, that happens. Traffic was moving, I was moving with it.

[slight concern]

Actually, now that I think about it... [pause] there was this camera thing at that intersection. One of those big flash camera setups? I remember seeing it as I went through.

[a bit worried]

Wait, was that light yellow or red when I went under it? I mean, I thought it was yellow, but I was focused on the car in front of me, and— [nervous laugh] oh god, what if it was red?

[increasingly anxious]

Those cameras are like, super sensitive, right? They'll ticket you for being in the intersection even if you're just— [sharp exhale] I can't afford a red light ticket right now. Those are like three hundred dollars!

[spiraling] [panicked]

Oh my god, what if there's already a ticket in the mail? What if it's sitting in my mailbox right now? [groan] I'm never taking shortcuts again. Never! Why did I think— [whimper] I'm gonna be checking my mail obsessively for the next two weeks!
