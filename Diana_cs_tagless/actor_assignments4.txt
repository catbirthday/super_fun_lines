Script: 26e6f143_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about your texts lately.

278 Character 2: Oh—oh god, okay. Um, what about them? I mean, I know I've been kinda weird lately but I didn't think—wait, are you mad at me?

Character 1: The passive aggressive comments need to stop.

279 Character 2: I wasn't being passive—okay no, that's not true. I was. I totally was and I'm sorry, I just—I've been in such a weird headspace lately, y'know? That's not an excuse though.

Character 1: "Sure, must be nice." "Okay whatever you say." Really?

280 Character 2: [Groan] God, hearing it back like that... yeah, that sounds terrible. I didn't—I wasn't trying to be mean, I swear. I was just feeling left out and instead of saying that like a normal person I got all... petty.

Character 1: You could have just talked to me.

281 Character 2: I know, I know! I should've just—I wanted to, honestly. But then I'd start typing and I'd delete it because what if I sounded needy or like, clingy? So instead I just... acted like a jerk apparently. [nervous laugh]

Character 1: It hurt.

282 Character 2: Oh no, I—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. The last thing I ever wanna do is hurt you. You're literally one of my favorite people and I just—I really messed this up, didn't I?

Character 1: Why didn't you just tell me you felt left out?

283 Character 2: Because I'm an idiot? No but seriously, I think I was scared that—that maybe you were pulling away on purpose? And if I asked directly and you said yes, then... I dunno, it would make it real.

Character 1: I wasn't pulling away. I've just been busy.

284 Character 2: Yeah no, I see that now. I totally see that. I was being paranoid and reading into everything and—god, those texts were so passive aggressive. I hate that I did that. I hate being that person, y'know?

Character 1: It made me not want to text you at all.

285 Character 2: Wait wait wait, please don't—I mean, I get it, but please don't stop talking to me. [Sigh] I promise I'll work on it. Like actually work on it, not just say I will.

Character 1: How do I know this won't happen again?

286 Character 2: Because I'm gonna—okay, from now on, if I'm feeling weird about something, I'm just gonna tell you straight up. No more hints or whatever that passive aggressive crap was. Just... honest communication. I can do that.

Character 1: Okay. I appreciate that.

287 Character 2: Really? You're not—you're not still mad? Because I would totally understand if you were. I mean, I'm still kinda mad at myself honestly, so...

Script: ff46a38f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You brought up the Jamie thing again.

288 Character 2: I mean—yeah, because it's literally the same situation. You're doing the exact same thing you did back then, and I'm just trying to—[sigh] I'm trying to help you see the pattern here.

Character 1: That was three years ago.

289 Character 2: Okay okay, but time doesn't make it irrelevant? Like, you're about to make the same mistake with Alex that you made with Jamie, and I'm supposed to just... not say anything?

Character 1: It's not the same.

290 Character 2: It's—come on, it's basically identical. You get all intense, you ignore the red flags, then boom—you're devastated when it falls apart. I'm not trying to be mean here, I just... I dunno, I thought that's what friends do.

Character 1: Friends don't throw past mistakes in your face.

291 Character 2: That's not—[frustrated laugh] wow, okay. So now I'm throwing things in your face? I'm literally just pointing out that maybe, y'know, we could learn from what happened before.

Character 1: Every argument. Every single time.

292 Character 2: Because you keep—ugh, fine. You keep repeating the same stuff! And then when I bring it up, suddenly I'm the bad guy who can't let things go? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?

Character 1: Maybe I don't need you to be my historian.

293 Character 2: Oh, so now I'm keeping score? Look look, I get that you're upset, but I'm not like, sitting here with a list of your failures. It just—it comes up because it's relevant, y'know?

Character 1: Is it though?

294 Character 2: Um, yeah? Yeah it is. When you're literally about to text Alex the same desperate paragraph you sent Jamie at 2am? [scoff] I mean, how is that NOT relevant?

Character 1: You memorized my texts now?

295 Character 2: I didn't—no, I just remember because I was there, holding your phone, telling you not to send it. And you did anyway. And then we spent like three weeks dealing with the fallout, so yeah, I remember.

Character 1: Must be nice being perfect.

296 Character 2: That's—seriously? I never said I was perfect. I've made plenty of mistakes, but at least when you point them out, I actually listen instead of getting all... whatever this is.

Character 1: This is me being tired of the reruns.

297 Character 2: And this is me being tired of watching you crash into the same wall over and over. But fine fine, next time I'll just—[groan] I'll just shut up and let you figure it out yourself. Again.

Script: 826bfd0d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I got the lead.

298 Character 2: Wait wait wait—the lead? Like, the actual lead lead? Oh my god, I knew you were auditioning but I didn't—this is huge! When did you find out?

Character 1: Yesterday. They called around three.

299 Character 2: And you're just now telling me? I'm—okay, I'm actually kinda offended but also like, totally proud of you right now. What's the play? Is it the Shakespeare one you mentioned?

Character 1: Yeah. Hamlet.

300 Character 2: You're playing Hamlet? That's—that's literally iconic. I mean, do you even realize how big this is? [Gasp] Wait, when do rehearsals start?

Character 1: Monday. Six weeks until opening night.

301 Character 2: Six weeks? That's like—okay that's actually really soon. How are you feeling about it? Because you seem weirdly calm for someone who just landed, y'know, the role of a lifetime.

Character 1: I don't know. Nervous, I guess.

302 Character 2: Nervous is—honestly? Nervous is totally normal. I'd be freaking out. Actually, no, I'd probably have thrown up by now [Laugh]. Have you told your parents yet?

Character 1: Not yet. Might not.

303 Character 2: What? No no no, you have to—I mean, they're gonna find out anyway, right? Unless you're planning to, like, perform in secret or something.

Character 1: They'll make it weird. You know how they are.

304 Character 2: Okay, yeah, fair point. Your mom would probably invite the entire neighborhood and make those embarrassing signs. But still, this is—you worked really hard for this, y'know?

Character 1: What if I'm terrible?

305 Character 2: Stop. Just—stop right there. You're not gonna be terrible. You literally made me cry reading that monologue in your living room, remember? And that was just, like, practice.

Character 1: That was different. This is real people. Critics.

306 Character 2: Critics are just—okay, they're basically professional haters anyway [Chuckle]. But seriously, you've got this natural thing when you perform. It's like you become someone else entirely, it's actually kinda scary how good you are.

Character 1: I almost didn't audition.

307 Character 2: But you did. And that's—I mean, that's the whole point, right? You showed up, you were brave, and now you're gonna be amazing. I'm definitely getting front row tickets, by the way. Like, try and stop me.

Script: cb307013_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about yesterday.

308 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I've been thinking about this all night. I know I—I know I messed up when you were trying to tell me about work and I just... I didn't handle it right.

Character 1: You laughed.

309 Character 2: I wasn't—I wasn't laughing AT you, I swear! It was just nervous, you know? Like when you said your boss was being passive aggressive, I thought you were making a joke and—wait wait, that's not an excuse. I'm not trying to make excuses.

Character 1: Right. Because my problems are hilarious.

310 Character 2: No no no, that's not—[groan] I'm making this worse. Your problems aren't funny, they're not. I just... sometimes I don't know how to respond to serious stuff and I kinda default to trying to lighten the mood? Which is stupid, I know it's stupid.

Character 1: You told me everyone deals with difficult bosses. Like it's nothing.

311 Character 2: I didn't mean it like—okay, I hear how that sounded now. Really dismissive. Like, really really dismissive. I think I was trying to relate? But instead I just... basically invalidated everything you were going through. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: This isn't the first time.

312 Character 2: I know. I—I've been thinking about that too, actually. Remember when you told me about your anxiety stuff and I said everyone gets nervous sometimes? That was—that was so shitty of me. I've been wanting to apologize for that for literally months but I didn't know how to bring it up.

Character 1: So you just kept doing it instead.

313 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I did. I think I'm just—I'm really bad at sitting with heavy stuff, y'know? Like my brain goes "quick, make it lighter, make it better" but that's not... that's not what you need from me. [sigh] That's not what being a good friend looks like.

Character 1: I just needed you to listen.

314 Character 2: I know. And I should've—I should've just shut up and listened. You were literally having such a hard time and instead of being there for you, I made it about... I dunno, my own discomfort with serious conversations? That's messed up.

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

315 Character 2: I'm gonna—I wanna do better. Like, genuinely. I know I can't just say that and make it okay, but... maybe you could call me out? When I do it? Because honestly sometimes I don't even realize until way later and then I'm like lying in bed at 3am going "oh shit, I did it again."

Character 1: I shouldn't have to teach you how to be supportive.

316 Character 2: No, you're right. You're totally right. That's—that's on me to figure out. I just meant... um, I mean... [nervous laugh] okay, I'm gonna work on it. By myself. And maybe, like, actually think before I speak for once?

Character 1: That would be new.

317 Character 2: Yeah, it would. But hey, I'm—I'm really sorry. Like truly, deeply sorry. You deserve a friend who takes your problems seriously, and I haven't been that person. But I want to be. If you'll... if you'll still let me try.

Script: 7c061766_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I did it.

318 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you mean the marathon? You actually—oh my god, you did it! How do you feel? Like physically, emotionally, spiritually, everything?

Character 1: Everything hurts.

319 Character 2: Oh no no no, of course it does! I mean, you just ran twenty-six point whatever miles, that's—[Laugh] that's literally insane. Are your legs even working right now?

Character 1: Barely. Had to crawl up my stairs.

320 Character 2: Stop it, you didn't actually crawl—wait, did you? Oh my god, you're gonna be feeling this for like, what, a week? Did you at least get one of those shiny blankets?

Character 1: Yeah. Still have it on.

321 Character 2: You're still—okay that's actually adorable. So like, what was the worst part? Was it the wall everyone talks about? That whole hitting-the-wall thing at mile twenty or whatever?

Character 1: Mile eighteen. Thought I was dying.

322 Character 2: Eighteen? That's—oof, that's early to hit it, right? But you kept going! You literally kept going even though your body was like, um, absolutely not. That's incredible.

Character 1: Some old guy passed me. He was seventy.

323 Character 2: Okay but—[Chuckle] honestly? Good for him. And good for you! You both finished, that's what matters. Did you cry at the end? I would've totally cried.

Character 1: Maybe a little.

324 Character 2: I knew it! See, this is why I love you—you're all tough and quiet but like, deep down you're just... you felt something big, didn't you? That's so human.

Character 1: My toenail fell off.

325 Character 2: Your—wait, what? Just now? Or like during the race? That's disgusting but also kinda badass? I dunno how you runners just accept that as normal.

Character 1: In my sock. Found it after.

326 Character 2: That's—okay I'm gonna pretend you didn't just tell me that. [Groan] But seriously though, are you proud of yourself? You should be so, so proud. Not everyone can do what you just did.

Character 1: Yeah. I think I am.

327 Character 2: You think? No no no, none of this "I think" business. You ran a whole marathon! Your first one! That's like—that's a forever thing, y'know? Nobody can ever take that away from you.

328 SCENARIO: waiting for a website to load on slow wifi

==================================================

[muttering]

Come on, come on, just— just load already. I mean, it's not like I'm asking for, um, for something crazy here, it's just— [sigh] it's just a basic webpage, right?

[slightly impatient]

Okay, so the little spinny thing is, uh, it's still spinning, which means it's trying, I guess? But like, how long does it— how long does it actually take to load one page? This wifi is supposed to be, um, it's supposed to be decent.

[drawn out]

Maybe I should, uh— maybe I should refresh? No wait, that's— that's probably gonna make it worse, right? Like, starting over from scratch when it's already, um, it's already trying to—

[brightening slightly]

Oh! Okay, something's happening. I can see, uh, I can see the header loading. That's progress. That's, um— [exhale] okay, we're getting somewhere.

[deadpan]

Aaaaand it's frozen again. Cool. This is, uh, this is exactly how I wanted to spend my lunch break. Just staring at a, um, at a half-loaded website like it's gonna magically—

[resigned]

You know what? I'll just— I'll just wait. What else am I gonna do, right? [tsk] Maybe I should get better internet.

Script: e21a45ad | Role: Character 1 (A)

329 Character 1: [triumphant roar] The castle is OURS! [breathless] Look how our banner catches the wind atop their highest tower. [getting louder] Twenty years of fighting, and finally—FINALLY—we've brought these tyrants to their knees!

Character 2: [exhausted but elated] My sword arm burns like fire, but by God, it was worth every swing. [deep satisfied sigh] Their so-called impenetrable walls crumbled like bread. [building excitement] We actually did it, brother!

330 Character 1: [quieter, awed] Remember when we were squires, dreaming of glory like this? [nostalgic chuckle] Now their throne room echoes with our footsteps. [voice breaking] My father would've wept to see this cursed place finally fall.

Character 2: [gravely] The cost was steep though. [slower pace] Young Marcus, brave Thomas, that fool Geoffrey with his jokes... [bitter laugh] They should be here planting this flag with us, not lying cold in the mud below.

331 Character 1: [fiercely] They died as warriors should—with honor! [softer now] Their names will be carved in stone, sung in every tavern. [rising intensity] This victory belongs to them as much as to us standing here!

Character 2: [weary tone] What now, though? [contemplative] We've toppled kings, conquered the unconquerable. [nervous laugh] Do we become lords ourselves, or does the road call us to more battles, more blood, more glory somewhere else?

332 Character 1: [dismissive snort] Lords? Us? [incredulous] Can you imagine me in silk robes, collecting taxes? [getting faster] No, no—there are other tyrants, other walls to breach, other wrongs that need our swords, brother!

Character 2: [relieved laughter] Thank God you said it first! [warmly] I was terrified you'd want to settle down, grow fat on wine. [loud declaration] Our work isn't finished until every corrupt castle bears a righteous flag!

333 Character 1: [sudden shout] Look there! [hushed amazement] The sun breaks through the storm clouds, shining on our colors. [reverent whisper] If that's not a sign from Heaven blessing our cause, then I'm a court jester's monkey.

Character 2: [joyful bellow] Then let them hear us from the valleys to the mountains! [commanding tone] Victory is ours! [Thunderous roar] The age of tyranny ends today, and the age of justice begins NOW!

334 Character 1: [breathless] Did we just—? [voice cracking] Oh my god, we actually did it! [louder, triumphant] The lift, the impossible lift that broke my ribs in rehearsal—we nailed it perfectly on opening night!

Character 2: [shaking voice] I can't stop trembling. [Sobbing laugh] When you landed, the audience gasped and I thought we'd failed, but then— [getting louder] they erupted! My legs are jelly but my heart is soaring through the ceiling!

335 Character 1: [whispered awe] Six months of bruises. [more intensely] Six months of ice packs and doubt and our director screaming we'd never get it. [Shriek] Look at us now! Champions of gravity, defying every single law!

Character 2: [slow, disbelieving] Your hands found my waist at exactly the right millisecond. [faster now] Like magnets clicking into place after searching forever. [Gasp] I flew! Actually flew for those three seconds—weightless, fearless, infinite!

336 Character 1: [choked up] My mother is in row five. [quieter] She watched me fail this a hundred times on video. [building excitement] Tonight she saw her daughter become art, become impossible, become everything I promised myself!

Character 2: [hysterical giggle] The spotlight hit us perfectly too! [in wonder] Like the universe conspired for this exact moment. [Whimper] I'm crying into my costume and makeup is everywhere but who even cares anymore? We're legends!

337 Character 1: [urgent whisper] Feel my pulse—it's insane! [more loudly] Two hundred beats per minute of pure adrenaline and joy. [softening] This is why we destroy our bodies, for this singular moment of absolute transcendence.

Character 2: [quavering] Remember when I dropped you last month? [stronger] You got a concussion and I thought you'd quit. [Sob] But you came back the next day, trusting me completely. That trust just paid off!

338 Character 1: [giddy] We should frame this costume! [in disbelief] No, bronze it! [Cackle] The exact leotard that witnessed history, still damp with triumph sweat and these beautiful tears that won't stop falling down my face!

Character 2: [reverent tone] Opening night magic is real. [building energy] Every superstition, every ritual, every prayer to the dance gods worked. [explosive joy] We transformed impossible into inevitable! My whole life led to these three seconds!

339 Character 1: [hoarse whisper] My ankles are screaming but my soul is singing. [more intensely] That moment of suspension, when time stopped— [Gasp] Did you feel it too? Like we bent reality itself to our will?

Character 2: [trembling] The other dancers are crying too. [steadier] Even Marcus, who never shows emotion, has tears streaming. [Whispered scream] We inspired them! We showed everyone that impossible is just another word for not yet!

340 Character 1: [rapid words] Quick, before we forget—remember every micro-second! [slower, desperate] The angle, the momentum, the exact way the air felt. [Whimper] I need to hold this feeling forever, bottle it, never let go!

Character 2: [laughing through tears] Your face during the lift! [quieter] Pure concentration then sudden joy, like sunrise breaking. [getting louder] The audience saw it too—that's when they started screaming! We gave them magic tonight!

341 Character 1: [soft wonder] Three seconds that erased three years of rejection letters. [building strength] Every "you're not good enough" just got deleted. [Shriek] This lift is my answer to everyone who said I should quit!

Character 2: [shaky exhale] I can't feel my legs anymore. [more solidly] Doesn't matter—I could float home on this feeling alone. [Sob-laugh] We're going to remember this forever, when we're old, we'll still remember!

342 Character 1: [fierce whisper] Tomorrow every dance company will know our names. [louder, prouder] The duo who conquered the unconquerable lift on opening night. [Breaking voice] But tonight, right now, it's just ours to feel!

Character 2: [overwhelmed] My hands are still shaking—look! [steadying] But not from fear anymore, from pure electricity. [Gasp] We channeled lightning through our bodies and survived! We're made of stars and stubborn dreams!

343 Character 1: [exhausted joy] I love you so much right now. [more intensely] My partner, my trust-fall, my co-conspirator against gravity! [Whimper-laugh] We really did it. We really, actually, impossibly did it on opening night!

Character 2: [peaceful exhaustion] Let's just stand here one more minute. [deeper, satisfied] Before the reviews, before tomorrow's show, before reality returns. [whispered triumph] Right now we're infinite, we're perfect, we're exactly who we dreamed we'd become!

Script: 7bf93e55 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I've been trying to get my dental claim approved for three weeks now. [sighs heavily] My claim number is DEN-447823-X and I've already submitted it twice through your portal at benefits.company.com/claims. [more angrily] Why was it denied again?

344 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson. Let me pull up your account using your employee ID—can you confirm it's E-90234-B? I'll review the denial reason right away for claim DEN-447823-X.

Character 1: [impatiently] Yes, that's my ID, and—and before you ask, my procedure was on October 15th at 2:30 PM. [groans] Dr. Martinez at 4500 Riverside Drive already confirmed it was pre-authorized under code D2740. [sarcastically] So what's the problem now?

345 Customer Support: [calmly] I see the issue here, Mr. Thompson. The claim shows a discrepancy between the pre-authorization amount of $1,250 and the submitted invoice for $1,380. [more carefully] Did you receive any additional services during that visit that weren't originally planned?

Character 1: [exasperated] No! That's—that's just the standard fee they charged everyone. [louder] I even called your helpline at 1-800-555-HELP last Tuesday, reference number HC-88912, and they said it would be fine. [accusingly] Are you telling me your own team gave me wrong information?

346 Customer Support: I'm reviewing the call log for HC-88912 now. [pause] [concerned] It appears there was a miscommunication about coverage limits for out-of-network providers. Your plan, the Premium Select PPO-200, only covers 80% for that specific code when it's out-of-network.

Character 1: [incredulous] Out-of-network? [scoffs] I specifically checked your website, and Dr. Martinez was listed as in-network on page three of the provider directory! [getting louder] I have a screenshot dated October 1st showing his NPI number 1234567890 as covered!

347 Customer Support: You're absolutely right to be confused. Our provider directory was updated on October 10th, and unfortunately, Dr. Martinez's contract expired September 30th. The system should have shown a notification, but I see there was a glitch between September 28th and October 12th.

Character 1: [angrily] So I'm supposed to just—just eat this $380 difference because of your glitch? [frustrated grunt] My wife already hit our deductible of $3,000, we've paid every premium since January. [desperately] Can't you make an exception given it's your system's fault?

348 Customer Support: Let me escalate this to my supervisor for a special review. Given the documented system error and your reference number HC-88912, we might be able to process this as an administrative adjustment. Can you hold while I conference in Manager Davies from extension 4421?

Character 1: [skeptically] Fine, but—but this is the fourth time I've had to explain this whole situation. [sighs] I've already sent three emails to benefits@company.com with all my documentation attached. [tiredly] How long will this take, because I have a meeting at 3:00?

349 Customer Support: It shouldn't take more than five minutes, Mr. Thompson. Actually, Manager Davies just messaged me on our internal system. [pleased] She's pre-approved an override code, OVR-2024-1847, for the full amount based on the system error documentation.

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, really? [cautiously optimistic] So the entire $1,380 will be covered, not just the—the original $1,000 they approved? [quickly] When will I see this reflected in my account, and will you send confirmation?

350 Customer Support: Yes, the full amount under override OVR-2024-1847. You'll receive an email confirmation within 24 hours to your registered address, jthompson@email.com. [helpfully] The reimbursement check will be mailed to 782 Oak Street, Apartment 5B, within 7-10 business days.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank God, I was about to—to file a formal complaint with the state insurance board. [chuckles nervously] Their complaint form is like twelve pages long. [gratefully] I really appreciate you actually listening and fixing this, unlike the last three reps.

351 Customer Support: I'm glad we could resolve this today, Mr. Thompson. I've also added a note to your account about the provider directory issue to prevent future problems. Is there anything else regarding your benefits or claims I can help you with while I have your file open?

Character 1: [thoughtfully] Well, actually, since you mention it... [hesitantly] My vision claim VSN-3421 from LensCrafters was also denied last month. [hopefully] The invoice was only $340, but they said something about frequency limitations?

352 Customer Support: Let me check that claim for you. I see you used your vision benefit in January 2024 for $450 at Pearl Vision. [explaining] Your plan allows one complete pair every 24 months, so you wouldn't be eligible again until January 2026.

Character 1: [disappointed] Ah, damn, I—I forgot about the January purchase completely. [sighs] My prescription changed in August, that's why I needed new ones. [resigned] I guess there's no override for legitimate prescription changes?

353 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Unfortunately, prescription changes don't qualify for frequency overrides under plan PPO-200. [more helpfully] However, you might check if your FSA account still has funds—you show a balance of $675 that expires December 31st. [encouragingly] That could cover your out-of-pocket vision expenses.

Character 1: [frustrated] I've been waiting here for two hours—two hours!—and your cleaning crew never showed up. [getting louder] I took time off work for this, rearranged my entire schedule, and [groans] now my house is still a disaster before my in-laws arrive tomorrow.

354 Customer Support: Oh my goodness, I am so, so sorry about this situation. Let me pull up your account right away—can you give me your confirmation number? We'll definitely get this sorted out for you immediately.

Character 1: [exasperated] It's, uh, 78234-B. [sarcastically] You know, this is the second time this month you've done this to me. [sighs heavily] What exactly am I paying premium service fees for if nobody actually shows up?

355 Customer Support: I see the booking here, scheduled for 2 PM today. There's no cancellation on our end, which means—let me check—yes, there was a miscommunication with the crew. This is absolutely unacceptable.

Character 1: [incredulous] A miscommunication? [louder] My mother-in-law literally arrives in eighteen hours! [desperately] I have three bathrooms that look like a tornado hit them, and my kitchen... [trails off weakly] I can't even describe the kitchen.

356 Customer Support: I completely understand your panic. Here's what I can do—I'm dispatching our emergency team right now, they can be there within the hour. Plus, we're waiving all fees and adding a complimentary deep clean next month.

Character 1: [skeptically] Within the hour—that's what you said last time. [bitter laugh] How do I know they won't just, I don't know, disappear into thin air again? [pleadingly] I really, really need this to work.

357 Customer Support: I'm personally monitoring this dispatch myself. The team leader, Marcus, will call you in exactly ten minutes to confirm. If they don't arrive by 4:30, we'll pay for any other service you book today.

Character 1: [cautiously hopeful] Okay... okay, that's—that actually sounds reasonable. [sighs] But they need to do the bathrooms first, then the kitchen. [more urgently] Can they handle pet stains? My dog had an incident yesterday that I haven't even—[groans] it's bad.

358 Customer Support: [efficiently] Absolutely, pet stains are no problem at all. I'm adding that note right now—bathrooms, kitchen, pet stain priority. Marcus has fifteen years experience, and honestly, [chuckles] he's seen everything. Your house will be spotless, I promise.

This must be read out in a single delivery as one file

379 SCENARIO: Offhandedly talking about a social media post they made, then checking the likes, then seeing a comment from their boss they didn't expect, spiraling into anxiety about what they posted

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, I posted that thing about the coffee shop earlier, you know? The one with the weird latte art that looked like a blob. [light laugh] I thought it was pretty funny.

[conversational]

Let me just check if anyone— oh, nice, okay, getting some likes. Sarah commented with the crying-laughing emoji, which, yeah, she gets it.

[slightly pleased]

Actually doing pretty well, like twenty-three likes already. Not bad for— wait. [pause] Wait, who is... 

[uncertain]

Oh. Oh no. My boss liked it. Which is... fine, I guess? But then she— [nervous laugh] she commented too.

[growing concern]

She wrote "So this is what you call 'working from the coffee shop' haha." With the little winky face emoji. [forced laugh] Which is... it's a joke, right? She's joking?

[anxious]

But like, I was actually working there this morning when I posted that. I had my laptop, I was answering emails, I was being productive! [rambling faster] But now I'm thinking, did it look like I was just goofing off? Taking pictures of coffee instead of working?

[spiraling]

Oh my god, what if she thinks I'm not taking my job seriously? What if this gets brought up in my review? [panicked] I'm gonna get fired because of a stupid latte post! [groan] Why did I even post that?
