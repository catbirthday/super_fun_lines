Character 1: You made fun of my music in front of everyone.

380 Character 2: What? No, I was just—come on, I was joking around. You know I didn't mean it like that. Everyone was laughing about their own stuff too, it wasn't just you.

Character 1: It wasn't funny.

381 Character 2: Okay okay, but you're acting like I—like I deliberately tried to humiliate you or something. [Scoff] That's not what happened and you know it. We always mess with each other like that.

Character 1: Not about that. You knew how much it meant to me.

382 Character 2: I mean... did I though? You never said it was off limits. I'm supposed to just, what, read your mind about which things are okay to joke about and which aren't?

Character 1: Common sense would've helped.

383 Character 2: That's—wow, okay. So now I don't have common sense. Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're kinda blowing this way out of proportion here. It was literally five seconds of teasing.

Character 1: Five seconds that everyone remembers.

384 Character 2: Nobody's gonna remember it by next week, I promise you. You're the only one still thinking about it. And honestly? [Frustrated laugh] You've said way worse stuff about my hobbies before.

Character 1: That's different.

385 Character 2: How? How is it different? Because—no seriously, explain it to me. Because from where I'm standing, it looks pretty much the same except you can dish it out but can't take it.

Character 1: I never did it to hurt you.

386 Character 2: And I didn't—ugh, I didn't do it to hurt you either! That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was supposed to be fun, y'know? Light. Not this whole... thing.

Character 1: Well it wasn't fun for me.

387 Character 2: Yeah, I'm—I'm getting that now, obviously. But like, instead of just telling me "hey that bothered me," you're giving me the silent treatment and acting like I'm some terrible friend. [Sigh] That's not really fair either.

Character 1: You haven't even apologized properly.

388 Character 2: Because you won't let me! You're so busy being mad that you're not even—fine fine, I'm sorry I teased you about your music. There. But I still think you're overreacting.

Character 1: That's not an apology.

389 Character 2: Well it's the best you're gonna get right now because honestly? I'm kinda hurt too that you think I'd ever intentionally—whatever. I need some air. We can talk when you actually wanna listen.

Script: 022e2776_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You missed my promotion dinner.

390 Character 2: I know, I know, I'm sorry—but I literally couldn't. I was having a full-on panic attack in my car and I—I couldn't even text you properly because my hands were shaking so bad.

Character 1: This keeps happening.

391 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's not entirely fair. I've shown up to plenty of things. You're making it sound like I never come through for you, which is just... [scoff] that's not true.

Character 1: Name the last important thing you actually showed up for.

392 Character 2: Um, your birthday? Your—wait, no, I had to leave early. But I was there! And before that, I went to your sister's wedding, remember? Even though I was basically dying inside the whole time.

Character 1: You left after twenty minutes.

393 Character 2: Because I was literally having trouble breathing! What do you want me to do, pass out at the reception? I'm trying here, I really am, but my anxiety isn't just—it's not something I can turn off.

Character 1: I defended you to everyone at that dinner. Again.

394 Character 2: And I appreciate that, I do, but honestly? I didn't ask you to. [frustrated laugh] Like, I'm already beating myself up about this stuff constantly, y'know? I don't need the guilt trip on top of it.

Character 1: Right. My fault for caring.

395 Character 2: That's—no, come on, that's not what I meant. You know that's not what I meant. I just... I'm doing my best here, okay? I'm in therapy, I'm on meds, I'm trying trying trying to get better.

Character 1: Your best isn't enough anymore.

396 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So what, you're just—you're done with me then? Because I have a mental illness that sometimes means I can't show up the way you want me to?

Character 1: I have anxiety too. I still show up.

397 Character 2: Yeah, well, good for you! Seriously, that's—that's great that yours is manageable enough for that. Mine isn't. [sigh] And I hate that about myself, trust me, but acting like I'm choosing this is just... it's kinda cruel, honestly.

Character 1: You choose not to communicate until after.

398 Character 2: Because I'm always hoping I can push through! I don't wanna be the friend who cancels, so I wait and wait and then suddenly I can't and—okay, yeah, maybe I should text sooner. Fine. That's valid.

Character 1: Maybe?

399 Character 2: Okay okay, I should. I should text sooner. But you gotta understand, I'm not flaking 'cause I don't care about you. It's literally the opposite—I care so much that the pressure makes everything worse, y'know?

Script: 0aa37718_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Made my last car payment yesterday.

400 Character 2: Wait wait wait—are you serious? Oh my god, that's like—that's huge! How long have you been paying on that thing?

Character 1: Four years.

401 Character 2: Four years of just... ugh, I can't even imagine. Do you feel, like, different? Because honestly when I paid off my student loans I literally [Laugh] cried in my car for like twenty minutes.

Character 1: It hasn't hit me yet. Still waiting for them to call and say they made a mistake.

402 Character 2: No no no, don't even—don't put that energy out there! You did this, okay? That's like, what, hundreds of dollars back in your pocket every month now?

Character 1: Three-fifty.

403 Character 2: Three hundred and—okay that's basically rent money! What are you gonna do with all that extra cash? Please tell me you're gonna treat yourself to something.

Character 1: Probably just save it.

404 Character 2: Of course you are. [Sigh] I mean, that's smart, that's really smart, but like... you gotta celebrate a little bit, right? This is a big deal!

Character 1: I might get the windows tinted.

405 Character 2: Oh—oh that's perfect actually! Because now it's like, really yours, y'know? No more bank breathing down your neck about every little scratch or whatever.

Character 1: Never had to worry about that. They don't care as long as you pay.

406 Character 2: Right right, but still—I dunno, there's something about actually owning it that just... it hits different. Like you could literally drive it off a cliff tomorrow and nobody could stop you. Not that you would! [Laugh] Obviously.

Character 1: Tempting some days.

407 Character 2: Okay but seriously though, this is like—this is such a grown-up milestone. I'm kinda jealous honestly. I've still got two more years on mine.

Character 1: Goes faster than you think.

408 Character 2: Yeah? Did you do anything special to pay it off early or just... stuck with the regular payments?

Character 1: Just kept paying. Nothing special.

409 Character 2: See that's—that's what I admire about you though. You just quietly get stuff done while the rest of us are out here like, making these big dramatic plans that never actually happen, y'know?

Script: 5a435b98_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You missed my graduation party.

410 Character 2: Oh my god, I know—I know I did and I'm literally the worst friend ever. I had it in my calendar, I swear I did, but then my phone died and I—that's not even a good excuse, is it?

Character 1: It's the third time this month.

411 Character 2: Wait wait wait, the third—okay yeah, you're right. The dinner thing and then your promotion celebration... [groan] I'm just—I've been such a mess lately, you know? Like my head's been all over the place but that's not—that's not fair to you.

Character 1: I'm done making plans with you.

412 Character 2: No no no, please don't say that. I mean—I get it, I totally get why you'd feel that way but like... I wanna fix this. I really, really wanna make this right because you're—you're super important to me, honestly.

Character 1: Am I though?

413 Character 2: Yes! God, yes, of course you are. I know it doesn't—okay I know my actions haven't been showing that lately [nervous laugh] but you are. I've just been really bad at... at following through on stuff and I hate that about myself right now.

Character 1: You promised you'd be there. You literally promised.

414 Character 2: I did. I—fuck, I did promise and I... I broke it. Again. There's no excuse that makes that okay, y'know? Like I could tell you about work being crazy or my anxiety being bad but that's—none of that matters because I let you down.

Character 1: It was important to me.

415 Character 2: I know it was. And I should've—god, I should've been there. You worked so hard for that degree and I just... [sigh] I missed celebrating with you because I can't get my shit together. I'm so, so sorry.

Character 1: Sorry doesn't really fix it this time.

416 Character 2: You're right. It doesn't. I keep—I keep saying sorry and then doing the same thing over and over, don't I? That's like... that's basically the definition of being a shitty friend. I need to actually change, not just—not just apologize.

Character 1: Yeah. You do.

417 Character 2: Would you—okay, I know I don't deserve it, but would you maybe give me one more chance? Like one actual last chance? I'm gonna put everything in multiple calendars, set alarms, I'll even—I'll text you the day before to confirm, every single time.

Character 1: Why should I believe you now?

418 Character 2: Because I'm—honestly? Because I'm scared of losing you. Like genuinely terrified. This conversation is making me realize how much I've been taking you for granted and I—[quieter] I can't lose you over my own stupidity. I won't let myself.

Character 1: I need you to actually show up. Not just say you will.

419 Character 2: I will. I mean—no, I know that's what I always say. But I'm gonna prove it, okay? Actions, not words this time. Just... please don't give up on me yet? I know I don't deserve it but I'm—I'm gonna do better. I promise. And I know my promises don't mean much right now but... I'm gonna make them mean something again.

Script: 8db55d2d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We won.

420 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you WON? Like actually won won? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna crush it but—[Gasp] this is huge! Tell me everything!

Character 1: Yeah. First place. Twenty thousand dollars.

421 Character 2: Twenty THOUSAND—okay no, I'm literally gonna pass out. That's like... that's life-changing money! What was your project again? The thing with the—the AI something?

Character 1: Accessibility tool for visually impaired coders.

422 Character 2: That's so—god, that's actually so important though. Like, you basically just made tech more inclusive and got paid for it? I'm honestly getting emotional right now.

Character 1: My teammates did most of the work.

423 Character 2: Oh no no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you minimize your contribution. [Sigh] You always do this! You were literally up for like 36 hours straight coding, remember?

Character 1: Coffee helped.

424 Character 2: Coffee helped, he says. Right, okay, sure. So um, what happens now? Do you get to like—is there more to it or do they just hand you a giant check?

Character 1: There's an incubator program. Three months. Optional.

425 Character 2: Are you gonna—I mean, you're gonna do it, right? This is like, this is your chance to turn it into something real! Unless you're not—sorry, I'm being pushy aren't I?

Character 1: Haven't decided. It means quitting my job.

426 Character 2: Oh. Oh shit, okay that's—that's actually a big deal. But like... when else are you gonna get an opportunity like this? [Chuckle] Sorry, I know, I know, it's complicated.

Character 1: My parents think I should stay at my job. Stable income.

427 Character 2: Of course they—I mean, they're parents, y'know? They worry. But honestly? You just proved you can literally create solutions that judges thought were worth twenty grand. That's gotta count for something.

Character 1: Maybe.

428 Character 2: Okay but like—can we at least celebrate first before you spiral into the whole practical adulting thing? Because you just WON A HACKATHON and I wanna buy you so many drinks right now!

Character 1: I don't really drink. You know that.

429 Character 2: Fine fine fine, mocktails then! Or—or ice cream? Pizza? Something! I'm not letting you just go home and pretend this didn't happen. This is literally the coolest thing ever and we're gonna—we're celebrating, okay?

430 SCENARIO: noticing a weird smell they can't identify

==================================================

[confused, sniffing]

Okay, what is— what is that smell? That's, um, that's definitely not normal. It's like, I don't know, it's not bad exactly, but it's just... [inhale] weird? Like, um, like if you mixed vanilla with, uh, with something musty maybe?

[muttering, moving around]

Is it coming from the kitchen? I mean, I didn't cook anything weird today, just— just the usual stuff. But maybe something went bad in the, um, in the fridge? [sniff] No, no that's not it. It's not that kind of smell.

[slightly puzzled]

Wait, is it— is it coming from upstairs? [pause] Huh. It's like, it's following me around, which is, um, which is either really concerning or I'm just, uh, I'm just being paranoid about it now.

[realization creeping in]

Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [sniff sniff] Is this my sweater? Did I, um— [laugh] oh my god, did I grab the wrong fabric softener or something? That would be so—

[relieved, slightly embarrassed]

Yep. Yep, it's definitely the sweater. Mystery solved. I'm just, uh, I'm just wearing weird-smelling laundry. [chuckle] Cool. Very detective of me.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: bafc5efc | Role: Character 1 (A)

431 Character 1: [sniffling] Oh my god, Sarah, look at them in their tiny caps! [voice breaking] Remember when we couldn't even get them to wear pants? [louder, wavering] Now they're singing the alphabet like actual humans!

Character 2: [through tears] Don't start, Lisa, or I'll completely lose it. [gasping breath] My mascara is already gone. [whimpering] When did they stop being babies who ate crayons and needed help with everything?

432 Character 1: [high-pitched wail] Jackson just waved at me from the stage! [quieter] He looks so proud in his construction paper diploma. [sobbing] I can't handle how grown up he thinks he is right now.

Character 2: [choked up] Emma keeps fixing her friend's tassel. [more emotionally] She's already taking care of people. [shaky exhale] Yesterday she was scared of the toilet flushing, today she's ready for kindergarten apparently.

433 Character 1: [trembling whisper] They're about to sing that rainbow song. [increasingly hysterical] The one they practiced every single morning while I made lunches. [wailing] I'll never hear them practice it again in our kitchen!

Character 2: [barely audible] Stop it. [growing louder] You're making it worse! [full sob] I already pre-cried in the car for twenty minutes and thought I was done with this emotional nightmare!

434 Character 1: [gulping air] Did you see them holding hands walking in? [steadier] All twenty tiny humans in a perfect line. [breaking again] Like they actually learned something about following directions this year!

Character 2: [nasally] My phone storage is full from recording this. [snorting laugh] I've taken three hundred photos of the back of other parents' heads. [weeping] But I need every second documented forever and ever!

435 Character 1: [whispering intensely] Mrs. Peterson is crying harder than us. [normal volume] Her twins are her last ones going through preschool. [sympathetic moan] She just mouthed "help me" from across the auditorium, poor thing.

Character 2: [hiccupping] Look at them attempting to stand still for the group photo. [giggling wetly] Tyler's picking his nose, Maya's dress is tucked into her underwear. [tenderly] These beautiful, perfect disasters are graduating!

436 Character 1: [dramatically] Why did we want them to grow up so fast? [softer, sadder] All those wishes for them to sleep through the night, walk, talk. [anguished] Now I'd give anything for one more baby snuggle!

Character 2: [thick voice] The teacher's doing the slideshow now. [panicking] Oh god, there's baby photos! [shrieking whisper] That's Emma on her first day, crying in my arms, and now I'm crying in these uncomfortable plastic chairs!

437 Character 1: [monotone] Other parents are staring at us. [defensive] Judge away, stone-hearted robots! [proudly sobbing] Our babies learned to share, use scissors, and not lick everything - that deserves these tears of pure joy!

Character 2: [squeaking] They're giving out the handprint art projects. [more controlled] Remember when Jackson printed the dog instead? [losing it again] These tiny hands won't be tiny next year - they'll hold pencils and write words!

438 Character 1: [determined] We need to pull ourselves together for pictures. [shaky] My mother-in-law will never let me forget if I look like this. [desperate laugh] Do you have any tissues that aren't completely soaked through yet?

Character 2: [rustling sounds] I brought a whole box but it's empty somehow. [pitifully] That dad over there has pocket tissues. [pleading] Think he'd share with two women who look like raccoons with emotional problems?

439 Character 1: [suddenly calm] Oh wait, they're singing the goodbye song. [building hysteria] The one where they wave their hands like butterflies. [completely broken] This is it, this is the end of preschool innocence forever!

Character 2: [raggedly] It's not even noon and I'm emotionally exhausted. [laughing while crying] We still have elementary, middle, high school graduations. [overwhelmed groan] How do parents survive watching their kids grow up constantly?

440 Character 1: [philosophical] Honestly, I'm proud of us for feeling this deeply. [more warmly] These kids know they're loved by moms who ugly cry at every milestone. [firm] That's better than perfect mascara any day, right?

Character 2: [exhausted] Absolutely right. [brightening slightly] Want to go get celebration ice cream with the kids after this? [hopeful giggle] Then probably cry again looking at all their preschool artwork we have to take home?

Script: 90426b2e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [nervous] Hi, um, I'm calling about my smart meter readings? [hesitantly] My account number is, uh, 4-7-2-9-1-6-B, and I've just moved into 42 Oakwood Avenue. [confused] The readings seem way too high for an empty property.

441 Customer Support: Good morning, let me pull up your account. Ah yes, I can see the property at 42 Oakwood Avenue. You're showing a reading of 8,742 kilowatt hours for just this month, which does seem unusual.

Character 1: [exasperated] Exactly! I only got the keys on the 15th, and I haven't even, you know, moved my furniture in yet. [sighs] The previous reading in September was 6,231, so how could it jump by over 2,500 units?

442 Customer Support: Let me check the meter serial number—is it SM-90-K-2847? Sometimes these smart meters can malfunction or, well, they might be reading from a neighboring property. When did you last physically check the meter yourself?

Character 1: [frustrated] I tried checking it yesterday but the display just shows these random numbers flashing—98.4, then 00.0, then back to some crazy high number. [groans] Should it be doing that? [worried] My estimated bill is already showing £487!

443 Customer Support: That definitely sounds like a fault. I'm going to log this as case number TK-2024-0913 for you. [helpfully] We'll need to send an engineer out, probably within 3 to 5 working days, to investigate.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank god, I thought I was going mad! [curiously] But what happens with my bill in the meantime? [anxiously] I can't afford to pay nearly £500 for an empty house, especially with the deposit I just paid.

444 Customer Support: [reassuring tone] Don't worry, we'll put a hold on the payment until this is resolved. I'm adding note reference MH-47B to freeze any direct debit attempts. We usually find these issues are resolved quickly once the engineer takes a look.

Character 1: [gratefully] That's such a relief, thank you. [suddenly remembering] Oh, will someone call before they come? [quickly] I work until 5:30 most days, but I can arrange to be there if I know when.

445 Customer Support: Absolutely, you'll get a text to 07—is it 07856-234-190?—with a 2-hour window. The engineer's reference will be ENG-8834-QM. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your account today, or shall we get that engineer visit sorted first?

Script: dfcb0e25 | Role: Customer Support

446 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Dr. Martinez's office, this is Rachel speaking. How can I help you today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I've been waiting for my referral to the specialist for, um, six weeks now? [sighs heavily] My doctor said it would take two weeks [more urgently] maximum, and I'm still in pain every single day.

447 Customer Support: Oh, I understand your frustration, let me just... pull up your file here. [pause] Can you verify your date of birth and the specialist you were referred to?

Character 1: [impatiently] March fifteenth, nineteen eighty-seven. [groans] It's for Dr. Chen, the neurologist? [more desperately] Look, I've called three times already and each time someone tells me they'll expedite it.

448 Customer Support: I see the notes here about your previous calls. [quickly] The referral was sent on the tenth, but it looks like—well, there might have been an insurance verification delay.

Character 1: [loudly] Insurance delay? [incredulous] My insurance approved it weeks ago! I called them myself because [voice breaking] nobody from your office would give me a straight answer about what's happening.

449 Customer Support: Sir, I understand you're upset, but we process dozens of referrals daily and sometimes the specialist's office takes time to—actually, let me call them right now while you're on hold.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, more waiting. [sighs] Can you at least tell me if the paperwork even made it there, or [desperately] did it just disappear into the medical void like everything else?

450 Customer Support: I'm going to place you on a brief hold—two minutes maximum—and I'll contact Dr. Chen's scheduling department directly. [firmly] We'll get this sorted today, I promise.

Character 1: [skeptically] You promise? [bitter laugh] That's what Jennifer promised last week, and Mark the week before that. [pleading] I just need to see someone before this gets worse.

451 Customer Support: Actually sir, I'm looking at your file more closely here. It shows Dr. Chen's office sent us a request for additional medical records on the twenty-second, but we never... responded?

Character 1: [outraged] Are you serious right now? [voice rising] So this whole time I've been waiting, suffering, calling, and it's just been sitting there [exasperated] because nobody checked their fax machine or whatever?

452 Customer Support: This is absolutely our error, and I'm so sorry. I'm marking this as urgent priority right now, and I will personally fax those records within the next ten minutes.

Character 1: [tiredly] Ten minutes. [sighs deeply] You know what, fine, but I need—[more firmly] I need something in writing that confirms this is happening today, because I can't do this dance anymore.

453 Customer Support: [professionally] Absolutely, I'll email you a confirmation with a tracking number for the referral. Also, I'm giving you my direct extension—two two seven—so you can reach me personally for updates.

Character 1: [cautiously] Okay, that's... that's actually helpful. [pause] But what happens if they need more information, [worried] because I literally cannot wait another six weeks for someone to notice another missing form.

454 Customer Support: I'm putting a flag in our system to alert me of any incoming requests from Dr. Chen's office. Plus, I'll call them after I send the fax to confirm receipt and get you a tentative appointment date.

Character 1: [relieved] Thank you, that's all I wanted from the beginning—just [emotionally] someone to actually follow through. [more calmly] When should I expect to hear back from you or them?

455 Customer Support: I'll call you back within two hours with confirmation, and Dr. Chen's office typically schedules within forty-eight hours of receiving completed referrals. I've noted your cell number here—is that still the best way to reach you?

Character 1: [grateful] Yes, that number's fine. [sighs] Look, Rachel, I'm sorry if I was harsh earlier, I'm just—[quietly] I'm exhausted from being in pain and fighting to get basic healthcare, you know?

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

456 [Disappointed] Oh. Oh no, I—I really thought I had it this time, you know? [Sigh] This is, uh, this is embarrassing.

457 [Fast] Wait wait wait, so you're telling me that the whole thing was—that I completely misunderstood? [Laugh] Wow, okay, I'm an idiot.

458 [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I spent three hours arguing about this and I was just—completely wrong the entire time?!

459 [Slow] So let me get this straight... everything I've been saying for the past, like, six months has been based on bad information? [Tsk]

460 [Happy] You know what? I'm actually kinda relieved to be wrong about this one! [Chuckle] That's, um, that's way better than what I thought.

461 [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, just fantastic—I only told, what, literally everyone I know? [Groan] This is gonna be fun to explain.

462 [Whisper] I can't believe I just—in front of all those people, I said... [Sad] God, they must think I'm such a fool.

463 [Disappointed] Honestly? I was so sure, like absolutely certain that I—[Sigh] I guess I should've actually checked first, huh?

464 [Fast] No no no, that can't be—I mean, I literally have the email right here that says—oh. [Slow] Oh, I misread it completely.

465 [Angry] This is such—ugh, I hate being wrong about stuff like this! [Tsk] Especially when I was so confident about it.

466 [Happy] Well, um, at least we figured it out before the presentation tomorrow, right? [Laugh] That would've been a disaster!

467 [Sad] I really wanted to be right about this one, you know? It's just—it made so much sense in my head. [Sigh]

468 [Sarcastic] Great, so basically I've been living my entire life thinking that—wow, okay, that's not humiliating at all. [Chuckle] Perfect.

469 [Whisper] Could you, uh, could you maybe not tell anyone about this? [Fast] I mean, I'll fix it, I'll totally fix it, but just—yeah.

470 [Slow] You're absolutely sure though? Because I could've sworn that the book said—actually, you know what, doesn't matter anymore. [Disappointed] [Groan]

471 [Shout] How did I miss something so obvious?! [Angry] It was literally right there the whole time and I just—I completely ignored it!

472 [Happy] Okay so, plot twist—I'm totally wrong but honestly? [Chuckle] Kinda makes the whole thing funnier if you think about it.

473 [Sad] I, um, I owe you an apology then, don't I? [Slow] All those times I corrected you and I was actually the one who was—yeah. [Sigh]

474 [Fast] Hold on, let me just—I gotta process this for a second because my entire worldview just kinda—[Laugh] This changes literally everything!

475 [Disappointed] Mm-hmm, yep, there it is in black and white. [Tsk] I dunno how I managed to convince myself otherwise, but here we are.

476 SCENARIO: Casually talking about a sticker they put on something, then trying to remove it, then seeing it's leaving residue and damage, spiraling into sticker regret

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, so, um, I put this cute little sticker on my laptop today. It was like, uh, this rainbow holographic thing? I thought it would, um, you know, brighten up the boring black cover a bit.

[matter-of-fact]

But then I was like, eh, maybe it's, um, maybe it's a bit much for work meetings and stuff. So I figured I'd just, uh, just peel it off real quick before my next call.

[slightly concerned]

Except it's not— it's not coming off clean, you know? Like there's this, um, this weird sticky residue and it's— oh no, wait. [sharp exhale] I think it's actually, um, it's actually taking some of the laptop finish with it?

[more worried]

Oh god, there's like— there's like a pale spot now where the sticker was. The, uh, the black coating is literally— it's literally peeling off in little, um, in little flakes with the adhesive.

[panicking]

This is a work laptop! This is— oh my god, what am I gonna— how do I explain to IT that I, um, that I damaged company property with a— with a rainbow sticker? [nervous laugh] They're gonna think I'm twelve years old!

[spiraling]

And now I can't get the sticky stuff off and it's worse— it's so much worse than just leaving the sticker! It looks like, um, like I attacked it with— with sandpaper or something! [groan] Why did I— why did I do this? It was fine! It was perfectly fine!
