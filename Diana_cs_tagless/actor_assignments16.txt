Character 1: You screenshotted our conversation.

1273 Character 2: I—okay, yeah, but it's not what you think. I only showed it to Jordan because they were literally going through the exact same thing and I thought—I dunno, I thought it might help them.

Character 1: That wasn't your decision to make.

1274 Character 2: Look, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I posted it online or something. It was one person—one—who doesn't even know you. [Sigh] And honestly? They really needed to hear it.

Character 1: My messages. My privacy.

1275 Character 2: Okay okay, but come on, it's not like I shared anything super personal. It was just the part where you were talking about dealing with anxiety at work—that's it. I cropped out everything else.

Character 1: Still wasn't yours to share.

1276 Character 2: Fine, you're right, technically—but can you maybe understand why I did it? Jordan was having a literal breakdown and your words were—they were perfect. [frustrated laugh] I was trying to help someone.

Character 1: By violating my trust. Cool.

1277 Character 2: That's—wow, okay, "violating" is a pretty strong word for showing one screenshot to help someone who was crying in my apartment. But sure, make me the villain here.

Character 1: You could've asked first.

1278 Character 2: Yeah, I could've, you're right. But it was like 2 AM and Jordan was—whatever, you don't wanna hear it. I'm sorry I didn't ask, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I was trying to do something good.

Character 1: Good intentions don't fix this.

1279 Character 2: I mean, they should count for something though, right? Like, there's a difference between me being careless with your privacy and me deliberately—[Groan] you know what, forget it. You've already decided I'm terrible.

Character 1: I never said terrible. Just disappointed.

1280 Character 2: Oh great, disappointed is so much better. Look look, I messed up, I get it. But you're being really—I dunno, rigid about this? Like we've been friends for how long and this is gonna be the thing?

Character 1: It's about boundaries.

1281 Character 2: And I respect that, I do, but—okay, honestly? You've shared stuff about me before too. Remember when you told Kyle about my thing with my ex? Without asking? But I didn't make it into this whole production.

Character 1: That's different and you know it.

1282 Character 2: Is it though? Is it really? Because from where I'm sitting, we both shared something to help someone else, except I'm the only one getting crucified for it. [Scoff] But yeah, sure, totally different.

1283 SCENARIO: waiting for the microwave while hungry

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, two minutes. Two minutes for leftover pizza. That's— that's not that long, right? I mean, I could, uh, I could probably wait two minutes without, like, completely losing my mind here.

[slightly impatient]

But I'm so hungry though. Like, really hungry. When did I even eat last? Was it— was it breakfast? Did I have breakfast? [sigh] I feel like I had coffee, but that's not— that's not really food, is it.

[drawn out, watching microwave]

One minute fifty. Okay. Um, okay, so maybe I should've just eaten it cold? Cold pizza's not that bad, right? People do that. College students do that all the time, so—

[faster, second-guessing]

No, no, warm pizza is definitely better. Melted cheese and all that. I made the right choice here. I'm just, uh, I'm just being dramatic because I'm hungry and when you're hungry everything takes forever and—

[fidgety]

One minute twenty. [groan] This is like watching paint dry. Actually, paint probably dries faster than this. Do I have anything else I could— I could grab some crackers or something while I wait? That's not, um, that's not cheating, right?

[resigned but lighter]

You know what, one minute left. I can do one minute. I'm an adult, I can wait sixty seconds for properly heated food. This is fine.

1284 Character 1: [sternly] You cannot go to this party with that boy. [voice rising] I don't know his family, his background—nothing! [Sharp exhale] What will people say when they see you alone with him at night?

Character 2: [exasperated] Mom, it's not "alone"—there'll be thirty people there! [pleading] Everyone from my class is going, and his parents are hosting it. [softer] Why can't you trust me like other parents trust their kids?

1285 Character 1: [incredulous] Other parents? [scoffing] Other parents don't care what happens to their children! [more firmly] We came to this country to give you opportunities, not to watch you throw away your reputation for some boy.

Character 2: [frustrated groan] He's not "some boy"—he's been my friend for three years! [defensive] And what reputation? [sarcastically] The one where I'm the only senior who's never been on a single date?

1286 Character 1: [proudly] Good! Dating is distraction. [quieter] When I was your age, I was studying every night, helping my mother with housework. [accusingly] Now you want to waste time on romance instead of focusing on college applications?

Character 2: [hurt] I have straight A's, Dad! [voice cracking] I got into three colleges already. [more desperately] When is it enough for you? When do I get to actually live my life instead of just achieving things?

1287 Character 1: [dismissively] This is living? [bitter laugh] Running around with boys who will forget you next week? [slower pace] In our culture, we date with purpose, with family involvement. Not this American nonsense of "having fun."

Character 2: [angrily] Well, I AM American! [voice breaking] I was born here, remember? [quieter, sadly] Sometimes I feel like you hate that about me—like I'll never be good enough because I'm not exactly like you.

1288 Character 1: [shocked whisper] How can you say that? [emotionally] Everything we do is for you! [voice trembling] But you're forgetting where you come from, becoming like these kids with no respect for family values.

Character 2: [tearfully] I'm not forgetting anything. [steadier] I'm just trying to belong somewhere. [exhausted sigh] Do you know how exhausting it is being stuck between two worlds, never fully accepted in either one?

1289 Character 1: [softer tone] You belong with us, with family. [hesitant] This boy... what does he know about our struggles, our sacrifices? [firmly] American boys, they don't understand commitment. They don't understand real responsibility.

Character 2: [gently] His grandparents were immigrants too, Mom. [hopeful] From Poland. He understands more than you think. [voice rising slightly] And he's teaching himself our language because he wants to speak with you properly someday.

1290 Character 1: [surprised] He's learning our language? [suspicious] Why didn't you tell me this before? [quick exhale] Still, words are easy. Actions matter more. What are his intentions with you?

Character 2: [embarrassed laugh] We're seventeen, not getting married! [reassuring] He asked me to winter formal, that's all. [pleading softly] One dance, with hundreds of teachers and parents watching. Please, just this once?

1291 Character 1: [long sigh] Winter formal... [contemplating] With chaperones? [more sternly] And you come home by ten-thirty, no later. I will pick you up myself, and I want to meet this boy first.

Character 2: [excitedly] Really? [disbelief] You're actually saying yes? [quickly] Ten-thirty is perfect, and of course you can meet him! [grateful whisper] Thank you for trying to understand. This means everything to me.

1292 Character 1: [warning tone] This is not permission for dating. [clearer] This is one event, one time. [nervous chuckle] And your aunt will probably have my head when she hears about this decision.

Character 2: [laughing] Aunt always has opinions about everything! [warmly] But you're my parent, not her. [sincere] I promise I'll be responsible, and I'll text you every hour if that helps you worry less.

1293 Character 1: [reluctantly amused] Every hour is too much. [gentler] Every two hours. [deep breath] Maybe I am too strict sometimes, but it's because this world... it's not always kind to young girls, especially our girls.

Character 2: [understanding] I know you're scared for me. [lovingly] But you raised me well—I know my worth. [confident] Trust the values you taught me. I won't let you down, I promise.

1294 Character 1: [firmly] Dr. Martinez, I need to discuss a serious breach of professional boundaries involving my therapist, Dr. Sarah Chen—license number 47B-2019. [pause] She friended me on Facebook last Tuesday, May 14th, and [voice rising] has been commenting on all my personal posts.

Customer Support: D2: [concerned] I understand this must be very uncomfortable for you. [reassuring tone] Let me pull up Dr. Chen's file—case number 892-XY—and we'll document this properly. [more seriously] Can you tell me, um, when exactly did you first notice these interactions?

1295 Character 1: [frustrated] It started innocently enough with a friend request around 9:30 PM, but then—[sighs heavily]—she liked seventeen photos from my 2018 vacation. [incredulous] She even commented "Looking great!" on my beach photos, which felt... invasive.

Customer Support: D4: [professionally] This is absolutely inappropriate behavior that violates Section 5.06 of our ethical guidelines. [pause] [more gently] I need to ask—have there been any other boundary crossings during your sessions at our 4521 Maple Street location?

1296 Character 1: [hesitant] Well, during our last three sessions she kept mentioning her divorce proceedings. [voice breaking] She spent maybe 20 minutes—20 minutes!—of my $175 session talking about her ex-husband Gary. [sarcastically] Really therapeutic for ME, you know?

Customer Support: D6: [apologetically] I'm so sorry you've experienced this unprofessional conduct. [more firmly] These violations—both the social media contact and the self-disclosure—require immediate intervention. [carefully] Have you, uh, responded to any of her online communications?

1297 Character 1: [defensively] I blocked her immediately after she sent me a private message at 11:47 PM asking if I wanted to grab coffee! [groans] My anxiety is through the roof—isn't she supposed to be helping with that?

Customer Support: D8: [shocked] A social invitation outside of therapy is a severe violation of protocol 7-A in our handbook. [reassuring] We're going to file a formal complaint with report number QM-2024-0892 today. [more softly] How are you managing emotionally with all of this?

1298 Character 1: [upset] Honestly? I feel betrayed and—[voice shaking]—I don't know if I can trust another therapist here. [bitterly] I've been coming to this clinic since 2021, and now I'm considering filing with the state board, license complaint form 45-C.

Customer Support: D10: [empathetically] Your feelings are completely valid, and you have every right to file that complaint. [determined tone] I'm suspending Dr. Chen effective immediately, pending investigation code R-77. [warmly] Would you like me to personally match you with a new therapist who specializes in, um, boundary-respectful treatment?

1299 Character 1: [skeptically] How do I know this won't happen again with therapist number—what would this be—four? [sighs] I specifically requested someone experienced when I filled out intake form 12-B, and look where that got me.

Customer Support: D12: [confidently] I personally supervise Dr. James Wong, license 51A-2020, who has zero complaints in five years. [reassuring] He's available Thursdays at 2:00 PM in suite 203, and I'll monitor your case myself. [more seriously] Would that provide enough oversight for you?

1300 Character 1: [considering] Dr. Wong... I've heard good things about him from the support group that meets Wednesdays. [cautiously hopeful] If you're personally guaranteeing oversight with your supervisor license—SV-8823, right?—then maybe I'll give it one more try.

Customer Support: D14: [warmly] That's correct, SV-8823, and I stake my reputation on this. [professional tone] I'll waive your next three copays—that's $105 saved—as an apology for this experience. [sincerely] Your trust means everything to us.

1301 Character 1: [relieved] Thank you for taking this seriously, unlike the office manager who said I was "overreacting" yesterday. [more firmly] I want everything documented though—every incident from May 14th through today, May 21st.

Customer Support: D16: [disapproving] The office manager dismissed your concerns? [frustrated] That's another issue we need to address—employee ID number? [determined] Everything will be in writing by 5:00 PM today, complaint reference TH-2024-521.

1302 Character 1: [tired] Employee 10847—Rebecca something—she practically rolled her eyes at me. [sighs deeply] I just want to feel safe in therapy again, you know? [quietly] Is that too much to ask for my mental health investment?

Customer Support: D18: [firmly] Absolutely not too much to ask—it's the bare minimum we owe you. [compassionate] Rebecca from reception will be retrained immediately on complaint protocols. [reassuring tone] Your new intake with Dr. Wong is scheduled for May 28th at 2:00 PM.

1303 Character 1: [gratefully] I appreciate you listening and actually doing something about this mess. [pause] [cautiously] Will Dr. Chen still have access to my files—all those notes from our 23 sessions?

Customer Support: D20: [decisively] Her access was revoked at 10:32 AM this morning—security protocol 9-Delta activated immediately. [gentle but firm] Only Dr. Wong and I will have file access, authorization code PM-447. [warmly] We're going to make this right for you, I promise.

1304 Customer Support: Thank you for calling Extended Shield Warranty Services, how can I— yes, I see your claim here. [more quickly] Unfortunately, your transmission failure isn't covered under your basic powertrain plan.

Character 1: [confused] Wait, what? The transmission IS the powertrain! [frustrated] I've been paying you people ninety dollars a month for three years, and now— [voice rising] now you're telling me it's not covered?

1305 Customer Support: [apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, really, but the CVT transmission in your vehicle falls under a different category— [clears throat] it's specifically excluded on page forty-seven of your contract.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, page forty-seven, of course! [groans] Nobody mentioned that when they sold me this— [pause] [angrily] this useless piece of paper that apparently covers nothing.

1306 Customer Support: [defensively] It's not useless, sir, it covers many components like— water pumps, alternators, starter motors. Just not continuously variable transmissions manufactured after 2018.

Character 1: [incredulous] Are you seriously— [stutters] I mean, the whole reason I bought coverage was for the expensive stuff! [desperately] Seven thousand dollars to fix this, and you're worried about water pumps?

1307 Customer Support: I can transfer you to our retention department who might— [speeding up] they sometimes have upgrade options available. Though I should mention there's a ninety-day waiting period for pre-existing issues.

Character 1: [laughs bitterly] Pre-existing? It just broke yesterday! [accusingly] You know what, I bet you deny everything— [pause] probably got a script right there telling you exactly how to say no.

1308 Customer Support: [offended] Sir, I don't work from a script, I'm trying to— [more quickly] Look, let me check with my supervisor. Sometimes we can file an exception for long-term customers.

Character 1: [skeptically] Oh, now there's exceptions? [mutters] Funny how those appear when I mention lawyers. [more firmly] Just tell me straight—will you cover this repair or not?

1309 Customer Support: [hurriedly] The supervisor says we can offer a one-time courtesy credit of— five hundred dollars toward your repair. [apologetically] It's not full coverage, but it's something we don't normally do.

Character 1: [outraged] Five hundred? [voice cracking] That's not even ten percent! [pleadingly] Come on, I've never made a claim before this, doesn't that count for anything?

1310 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I really wish I could do more, but— [speaking quickly] the underwriters set these limits, not me. Have you considered our platinum plan for future coverage?

Character 1: [incredulous] You're trying to UPSELL me? [laughs angrily] While I'm sitting here with a dead car? [slowly] This is exactly why people hate insurance companies.

1311 Customer Support: That's not what I— Sir, I'm documenting everything in your file for the review board. Sometimes they overturn initial decisions within five business days.

Character 1: [exhausted] Five more days without a car, fantastic. [mutters] You know what, just— [resignedly] just send me whatever paperwork I need for this supposed review.

1312 Customer Support: I'll email those forms right now, and— actually, I just noticed you might qualify for our hardship provision. It requires additional documentation though.

Character 1: [suspiciously] Hardship provision? [sarcastically] Let me guess, it covers everything except actual hardships? [sighs] What documentation are we talking about here?

1313 Customer Support: Three months of bank statements, two repair estimates, and— a notarized affidavit stating this failure impacts your ability to work. But it could increase coverage to seventy percent.

Character 1: [defeated] Fine, whatever, I'll do it. [mutters] Seventy percent is better than— [pause] [bitterly] better than the nothing you wanted to give me initially. [tiredly] Just email me everything, please.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1314 [Disappointed] Yeah, I get it, Sarah's the smart one—I've only heard that, like, a thousand times before. [Sigh]

1315 [Angry] [Fast] Stop, just stop comparing us, okay? We're different people with different—God, why do I even bother explaining this anymore?

1316 [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another story about my brother's promotion, how refreshing and not at all predictable. [Tsk]

Okay, so there's no cars coming from that direction, and there's no cars coming from— I mean, there's literally nobody here. Why can't I just— but no, no, that's how you get hit by a car, right? The one car you don't see.

[slightly overwhelmed]

There's that true crime one, but it's, uh, it's kind of heavy for a Tuesday morning, you know? And then there's the, um— the comedy one, but I'm like three episodes behind and I feel like I'm gonna be lost if I just jump in. [tsk] Why do I do this to myself?

[brightening slightly]

Oh, wait, what about that new one? The, uh, the food one that Sarah recommended? But is it— is it actually good or is it just, like, trendy right now? [hmm] I hate when I pick something and then it's boring and I'm stuck with, um, with dishes and boredom.

[resigned but decisive]

You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna hit shuffle on the comedy ones. Even if I'm behind, it's not like, uh, it's not like there's some complex plot I'm missing. [laugh] Problem solved. Sort of.

But I was, uh, I was rushing this morning because of the, um, the thing with my coffee maker, and I had to— I had to use the French press instead, which took forever, and then I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna be—

Wait wait wait. Let me just— let me think about this. I grabbed my keys, I walked to the door, I opened it, stepped out, and then I— did I turn around? I feel like I turned around, but maybe I was just, uh, maybe I was just thinking about turning around?

[frustrated sigh]

[more animated]

This is— this is so annoying. Like, why can't I just remember doing something I literally do every single day? It's muscle memory, it should be— [tsk] I mean, it's not like it's complicated.

[slightly nervous]

But I mean, we were laughing about it, so that's— that's a good sign, right? Right? [sigh] God, why is this so— why do I always overthink these things? It's literally just a text. People send texts all the time.

[faster]

Okay, but what if they don't respond? What if they think I'm being too, um, too forward or something? Because we don't really text that much, and this is kind of— it's kind of random, isn't it?

[hesitant]

Unless... unless it's not that random? I mean, they did give me their number, so they probably— they probably want me to use it, right? [hmm] That's how numbers work.

[decisive, then wavering]

You know what? I'm just gonna— I'm gonna send it. Life's too short to, uh, to worry about every little— [pause] or maybe I should wait until tomorrow?

I mean, it was completely dead, so that's— that's on me, I guess. But like, shouldn't there be enough juice by now to at least, um, to at least turn on? Even for like two seconds? [tsk] I just need to check if— if Sarah texted me back about tonight.

Let me just— let me try pressing the button again. Maybe it'll— [pause] nope. Still nothing. Just that stupid black screen judging me for my, uh, for my poor charging habits. Which, okay, fair enough.

I should probably just, um, just leave it alone for like ten more minutes, right? That's what normal people would do. Patient people. But I'm not— I'm clearly not patient people because here I am talking to a dead phone like it's gonna, uh, like it's gonna suddenly care about my schedule.

Okay, so, um, so what can I do here? I could return it, right? But then I'd have to, uh, I'd have to drive all the way back, wait in that line again, and then— and then rebuy the exact same thing? That seems, um, that seems kind of ridiculous.

[matter-of-fact]

And I'm like, "Yeah, just, um, just grab the holds and pull yourself up, it's— it's not rocket science." [light laugh] So he goes over to try one, and I'm, uh, I'm watching him, and he's just— he's really struggling, you know? Like, uh, like really struggling with this, um, this basic green route.

Because I kept saying "easy" and "basic" and, um, and "just do this" and— oh god, I made him feel like an idiot, didn't I? Like, uh, like I was talking to him like he was— [groan] like he was five years old or something.

I'm gonna have to call the bank tomorrow and sit on hold for like an hour, and then wait two weeks for new cards, and I have that dinner thing on Friday that I'll have to—

[surprised]

Oh wait. Wait wait wait. I'm— hold on, let me just...

[sheepish] [relieved]

Oh my God. [nervous laugh] It's in my other jacket. The one I wore yesterday.

I just— I felt something in the pocket and... yep. There it is.

[embarrassed] [laughing]

1345 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a broken coffee maker, then finding a great cafe nearby

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my god, so I wake up this morning, right? And I go to make coffee and the stupid machine just— it won't even turn on. Like nothing. Not even a little light or anything.

[annoyed]

And of course this happens on a Monday when I have that early meeting, so I'm just standing there like an idiot pressing buttons, and I'm like, I don't have time for this. I don't have time to deal with broken appliances right now.

[exasperated] 

So I'm gonna have to go to work with no caffeine, which you know how I get, and I'm already calculating like okay, how much is this gonna cost me to replace, when am I gonna have time to go shopping for a new one... [sigh]

[irritated]

And I'm walking to the bus stop all grumpy and whatever, and I'm like, this day is just— this day is already ruined before it even—

[surprised] [brightening]

Wait, oh my god. There's this little place right here I've never noticed before. Like literally two blocks from my apartment. "Rosewood Coffee" or something cute like that.

[delighted]

Dude, this place is amazing. The coffee is incredible, way better than my stupid machine makes anyway, and the guy behind the counter was so nice, and it's like— it's cheaper than Starbucks!

[warm] [realizing]

I think... I think my coffee maker breaking was actually like the best thing that could've happened. I have a new spot now!

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, you know what happened earlier? This tourist stopped me on Fifth Street asking for directions to the art museum. Nice older couple, seemed really excited about it. [light laugh] I was like, oh yeah, super easy, just go straight down to Main, take a left, and you can't miss it.

[conversational]

They were so grateful too, you know? Like, "Oh thank you so much, you're so kind!" Made me feel all helpful and local. [chuckle] I was practically strutting after that, like look at me being a good citizen and everything.

[slight pause] [a bit uncertain]

But wait, actually... [trailing off] Main Street, left... that would take them to... [pause] Hold on, where does that actually go?

[growing concern]

Oh no. Oh no no no. [nervous laugh] That's— that's not the art museum. That's the industrial district. There's literally nothing down there except, like, warehouses and that weird fish processing plant.

[increasingly distressed]

They're probably still walking around right now! This sweet elderly couple wandering through loading docks because I— [groan] because I mixed up my lefts and rights like some kind of— [frustrated exhale]

[spiraling] [guilty]

Oh my god, they trusted me! They probably think I did it on purpose! [whimper] They're lost and it's all my fault and I'll never see them again to apologize and— [defeated] Great. Just great.

==================================================

[matter-of-fact]

So I returned that bluetooth speaker yesterday, you know, the one I got last week? It just— the sound quality was terrible, like really tinny, and for eighty bucks I expected better. Pretty straightforward return, got my receipt, they said seven to ten business days.

[casual]

Actually, let me just check if it went through yet. [pause] I mean, it's only been a day but sometimes these things are faster than they say, right?

[slightly confused]

Hm, that's weird. It says here the return was... denied? [scoff] That doesn't make sense, I literally just dropped it off yesterday with all the original packaging.

[more concerned]

Wait, denied for what reason? "Item shows signs of damage not consistent with normal use." What? [frustrated laugh] What damage? I used it for like three days!

[building frustration]

Oh, oh this is rich. So now I don't have the speaker AND I don't have my money? They're just keeping both? [sharp exhale] How is that legal?

[spiraling]

Eighty dollars! Just— gone! For a product I don't even have anymore that they're claiming I somehow destroyed! [huff] What am I supposed to do, drive back there and argue with some teenager about "damage" that doesn't exist?

[exasperated] [bitter laugh]

This is insane. This is actual theft. They have my money and my product and I have nothing but a stupid email telling me I'm a liar!

==================================================

[excited] [breathless]

Oh my God, okay, so you know how Sarah's birthday is on Saturday? I've been planning this whole surprise party for like three weeks now and it's— it's going to be perfect. I got everyone to agree to come, even her sister who lives like two hours away.

[giddy]

And I found this little bakery that makes those lemon cupcakes she's obsessed with, you know the ones from that place that closed down? They do the exact same recipe and I ordered like four dozen because you know how she gets about sharing dessert. [laugh]

[animated]

I've been so good about keeping it secret too, like when she was like "oh I don't know what I'm doing for my birthday, probably just staying in" I was like "yeah totally, low-key sounds nice" when inside I'm just— I'm dying to tell her about all the decorations I bought.

[suddenly worried]

Wait, hold on, she's texting me right now... um...

[voice cracking] [emotional]

Oh. Oh my God. She says "thank you for planning something so special for me, I can't wait to be surprised on Saturday."

[crying happy tears] [overwhelmed]

She— she knows and she's just... she's letting me surprise her anyway? That's so— [sniff] God, that's so Sarah. She probably figured it out days ago and just wanted me to have my moment.

[annoyed]

And I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to be understanding because babies cry, whatever, but I had such a long day and I just wanted to close my eyes for like five minutes. But no, this kid is just— [groan] it was so loud.

[irritated]

The mom looked exhausted too, but like, I don't know, maybe walk around with it? Do something? I kept turning around and giving these looks, which I know is terrible but I was just so—

[quieter]

Oh wait. Actually, hold on.

[softer] [realizing]

The baby just... it just went completely quiet. Like, dead silent. And I can see the mom over the seat, she's just holding this tiny little thing and it's totally passed out on her shoulder.

[guilty] [warm]

God, she looks so relieved. Like, actually about to cry herself. [small laugh] I feel like such an asshole now for being annoyed. She was probably more stressed than anyone, trying to calm down her kid while people like me are glaring at her.

[sheepish]

Yeah, I'm... I'm definitely the villain in this story.

[frustrated]

Just gone. Black screen, won't restart, the whole thing. And I'm standing there on the corner like jabbing at my phone like an idiot because I was right in the middle of this crazy part where they're about to reveal who was behind the whole scheme, you know?

[irritated]

So I'm like great, just great. Now I have to remember where I was, probably gonna have to scrub through the whole episode again to find my spot. You know how impossible that is with these true crime things? Like every part sounds the same when you're trying to— 

[surprised]

Wait, hold on. Let me just... I'm opening it now to show you how annoying this is gonna be.

[amazed] [pleased]

Oh. Oh wow, it— it actually saved my place perfectly. Like exactly where it cut out. That little timeline thing is sitting right at 23 minutes and 40 seconds.

Oh, so, um, I had this weird thing today. There was this, uh, this charge on my credit card for like forty-three dollars from some, um, some company I'd never heard of? So I was like, you know, whatever, I'll just, uh, I'll just dispute it real quick.

[matter-of-fact]

It was called like, um, "Premium Services Solutions" or something equally, uh, equally sketchy sounding, you know? I mean, I definitely didn't— I didn't sign up for any premium, um, any premium anything recently, so, uh, yeah, seemed pretty obvious.

[conversational]

So I'm, um, I'm telling you this because I just got the, uh, the email back from my bank and— oh wait, hang on. [exhales] Let me just, um, let me check what they said about—

[confused]

Oh. Oh wait. Okay so, um, so they're saying it was— it was legitimate? And they're like, uh, listing all this evidence and— wait, what is— what is this?

[growing concern]

It says here that it was for, um, for my software subscription that I, uh— [sharp exhale] Oh no. Oh no no no. That's— that's my, um, my design software that I use for work. The one that, uh, that auto-renews every month.

[panicking]

[groaning] Oh my god, I just— I just disputed my own, um, my own legitimate charge! They probably think I'm some kind of, uh, some kind of scammer now! I'm probably flagged in their system as like, uh, as someone who tries to— [frustrated laugh] who tries to steal forty-three dollars!

[spiraling] [mortified]

Great! Just— just great! Now I have to, um, I have to call them back and be like "Hey, sorry, I'm just, uh, I'm just an idiot who can't remember what I, um, what I pay for!" [defeated groan] This is— this is so embarrassing!

[conversational]

He seemed pretty grateful, you know? Said he was gonna check it out this afternoon since he had that interview nearby. I was like, yeah, perfect timing, you'll beat all the traffic on Main Street.

[slight pause] [thoughtful]

Actually, now that I think about it... when was the last time I even went through there? It's been a while, hasn't it? Maybe like... [trailing off] maybe a few months?

[a bit uncertain]

Wait, didn't they... didn't they tear down some of those buildings recently? For the construction project? [nervous laugh] I mean, it's probably fine, right? It's not like they'd block off a whole—

Oh. Oh no. [sharp intake] The news story. About the break-ins in that area. That was— that was last week, wasn't it?

Oh my god, I sent him through there alone! With his laptop bag! For an interview! [voice rising] What if something happens to him? What if he gets mugged or— [frantic] I have to call him. I have to call him right now. This is all my fault!

[heated]

And of course they didn't leave a note or anything, because why would they? Why would anyone take responsibility for their actions? [scoff] I literally just got that car detailed like two weeks ago, it was perfect.

[frustrated]

I'm gonna have to take it to a body shop, get an estimate, deal with insurance— this is gonna cost me like hundreds of dollars probably. And for what? Because some idiot can't park properly or open their door like a normal human being?

I was walking around the whole parking lot trying to figure out who did it, like looking at other cars for paint marks or whatever, but— God, people are just so inconsiderate, I swear.

Wait, hold on. Let me just— I'm looking at it again right now and... huh. Actually, um...

Oh. Oh wow, okay. It's— it's coming off. Like I'm just rubbing it with my finger and it's... that's just dirt or something. It's not actually scratched.

[conversational]

It's about those budget projections she asked for. Nothing major, just some numbers she needed for the board meeting. I remember being pretty thorough with it actually, did all the charts and everything.

[slightly concerned]

Wait, let me just check when I actually wrote this thing. [pause] Okay, pulling up my drafts now... where is it... there it is. Um. [nervous laugh] This says... March fifteenth?

[growing worried]

March fifteenth. That's— that's like three weeks ago. The board meeting was... [trailing off] oh no. Oh no no no.

[panic building]

The board meeting was March twentieth! She needed this for the board meeting and I— [sharp exhale] I just let it sit in my drafts like some kind of— ugh!

It finally comes today and I'm just, ugh, I'm so irritated about it, you know? Like it's got this little note about how sorry she is it's late, blah blah, and I'm like— just send it on time? It's not that hard to put something in the mail.

[still annoyed]

I almost didn't even want to open it because I was so— I was just being petty about the whole thing. Like why does she always do this? Birthdays, Christmas, everything's always late with her.

[surprised]

But then I— oh wait, there's like— [rustling sound] there's cash in here. Like actual cash, not just a check.

[softer] [slightly guilty]

Oh. There's... there's like a hundred bucks in here. And this note about how she wanted to get me something special but didn't know what, so she thought I could pick something out myself.

I'm so mad, like I specifically told everyone to keep it quiet, and she just— [sigh] I don't know why I even bothered. I spent so much time coordinating with everyone, getting the cake, decorating...

I was so ready to quit my stupid retail job and actually do something, you know, meaningful with my summer.

[defeated]

And the worst part is I turned down that thing at my mom's friend's office because I was so sure I was gonna get this one. So now I'm just— I'm stuck folding sweaters for another three months while everyone else gets these amazing opportunities and—

[surprised]

Wait, hold on. My phone's buzzing and it's... oh. Oh wow, it's Professor Chen from my portfolio class.

[excited] [disbelieving]

She— okay she says the creative director at her old agency just called her looking for an intern and she immediately thought of me? And it's paid. Like, actually paid. Way more than that other place was offering.

I literally cannot believe this. This is so much better than— God, maybe getting rejected was actually the best thing that could've happened.
