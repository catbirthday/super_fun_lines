Character 1: We need to talk about last night.

825 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know, I know exactly what this is about. Listen, I was having such a weird night and I didn't mean to—actually no, that's not an excuse. I'm sorry.

Character 1: You made them cry.

826 Character 2: Wait, they cried? Oh no no no, I didn't—I had no idea they actually... [groan] This is so much worse than I thought. I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

827 Character 2: I just—okay, I was trying to be funny, y'know? Like that thing where you tease someone to break the ice but I totally misread the room and went way too far. I didn't realize they'd take it so personally.

Character 1: They're shy. You know this.

828 Character 2: I do! I do know that, which makes it even worse honestly. I just got carried away with the whole—ugh, I dunno, trying to seem cool or whatever. [nervous laugh] Which obviously backfired spectacularly.

Character 1: They almost left the party because of you.

829 Character 2: They—what? No, are you serious? God, I'm literally the worst friend. I should've just kept my mouth shut instead of making those stupid comments about their job.

Character 1: And their clothes. And their hometown.

830 Character 2: Right, yeah, that too. I was just—I was nervous meeting them properly for the first time and when I'm nervous I just kinda... word vomit everywhere. But that's not—they don't deserve that.

Character 1: No. They don't.

831 Character 2: Can I—would it be okay if I called them? To apologize? Or would that make it worse? I genuinely wanna make this right but I don't know if they'd even wanna hear from me at this point. [sigh]

Character 1: I don't know. They're pretty hurt.

832 Character 2: Yeah, of course they are. God, I really really messed up. Look, I'll—I'll write them a proper apology. Like not a text, an actual letter or something. Would that help?

Character 1: Maybe. It's a start.

833 Character 2: And you—are we okay? I mean, I know we're not okay okay, but like... you're my best friend and I basically insulted the person you love. That's so messed up of me.

Character 1: I need some time. But yeah, we'll be okay. Eventually.

834 Character 2: Okay. Yeah, that's—that's fair. Thank you for even talking to me about this instead of just... cutting me off. I promise I'll fix this. Whatever it takes, seriously.

Character 1: So my potato thing got three million views.

835 Character 2: Wait wait wait—your what? The potato— [Gasp] oh my god, the crispy smashed potato thing? That went viral?

Character 1: Yeah. Woke up to like eight hundred comments.

836 Character 2: That's—okay that's actually insane. Like, literally insane. How are you feeling about it? Because I'd be, um, totally freaking out right now, honestly.

Character 1: It's weird. People are making it in Australia.

837 Character 2: Australia! Okay no no no, that's—you're literally international now! Have you been, like, reading all the comments and stuff?

Character 1: Some lady in Portugal said it changed her life. It's potatoes.

838 Character 2: But it's YOUR potatoes! I mean—okay yeah, but like, you created something that people actually love, y'know? That's kinda [Laugh] that's amazing though.

Character 1: Food bloggers keep messaging me. Want to "collaborate."

839 Character 2: Oh god, the—ugh, the influencer types? They're probably gonna, like, steal your recipe and pretend they invented it or something. Are you gonna respond?

Character 1: I don't even have a food blog.

840 Character 2: Well maybe you should! I mean—wait, actually, do you even want one? Because like, this could be a whole thing if you wanted it to be.

Character 1: My mom keeps sending me screenshots. From Facebook.

841 Character 2: Of course she does! [Chuckle] That's so—that's such a mom thing. She's probably telling literally everyone she knows, right? Like "my child's famous on the internet!"

Character 1: Someone made a TikTok remix. With my potatoes.

842 Character 2: Stop it—there's a remix? Of potatoes? I need to—okay you're sending me that immediately because that sounds absolutely ridiculous and I'm kinda here for it.

Character 1: They're selling my recipe on Etsy now. As a PDF.

843 Character 2: They're WHAT? No no no, that's—that's not okay! That's literally your thing! Are you gonna, like, do something about that? Because that's basically stealing, right?

Character 1: It's five ingredients. Not exactly intellectual property.

844 Character 2: Okay but still—I mean, you're being way too chill about this. You basically broke the internet with potatoes and you're just... sitting there. That's the most you thing ever, honestly.

845 SCENARIO: discovering their phone charger only works at a certain angle

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so my phone's at, like, twelve percent, which is— which is not great. Let me just, um, let me plug this in and— [sigh] oh, come on. It's not— it's not charging.

[slightly annoyed]

Is it the outlet? No, the outlet's fine, I literally just used it for my, um, for my laptop charger yesterday. So it's gotta be— wait, let me just wiggle this thing a little bit.

[concentrating]

Okay, if I just— if I hold it like this and kind of— [huh] oh! There it goes. It's charging now. But like, why do I have to— I mean, that's not normal, right?

[resigned]

So apparently I have to, um, I have to hold my charger at this weird little angle now. Great. That's, uh, that's super convenient for my lifestyle. Let me just— can I lean it against something? Maybe if I prop it with this book...

[testing]

Okay, okay, it's still going. As long as nobody breathes on it too hard, we should be— we should be fine. This is fine. Everything's fine.

Script: a2dc1637 | Role: Character 1 (A)

846 Character 1: [whispered] Look at them up there. [voice breaking] My little Emily's actually remembering all her lines. [sniffling] I thought she'd freeze like in the living room rehearsals, but she's absolutely glowing under those lights.

Character 2: [choked up] I know, right? [steadier] Jake practiced that sword fight scene a hundred times in our garage. [laughing through tears] He accidentally broke two lamps, but watching him nail it now makes everything worth it completely.

Character 3: [trembling] They've been inseparable since kindergarten, planning this moment. [more composed] Remember when they made us sit through their backyard Shakespeare? [soft chuckle] Five years old, making up half the words, but so utterly serious about it.

Character 4: [nostalgic tone] Those cardboard crowns and bedsheet capes! [getting emotional] Now look—real costumes, actual staging, a packed auditorium. [proud whisper] Sometimes I can't believe these confident kids on stage are the same babies we used to rock to sleep.

Character 5: [urgently] Quick, get your phone out—the balcony scene's coming up! [excited whisper] Emily told me they've been practicing this part extra. [voice cracking] She wanted it perfect because she knew we'd all be watching together tonight.

Character 6: [shaky breath] Already recording, been filming since curtain rise. [more firmly] My wife's gonna kill me for missing this—stupid business trip. [emotional] But she'll forgive me when she sees Jake delivering these lines like a real professional actor.

Character 7: [hushed awe] The way the spotlight catches her face during this monologue. [voice wavering] She looks so grown up, so capable. [barely audible] Where did my pig-tailed girl who needed help tying her shoes disappear to?

Character 8: [thick voice] They grow up when we're not looking, between soccer practices and homework battles. [clearer] One day they need us for everything. [falling to whisper] Next thing, they're commanding a stage, making hundreds of people feel something profound.

Character 9: [suddenly urgent] Oh god, here comes Jake's big emotional scene. [nervous laugh] He made me practice being the dying friend twenty times yesterday. [proudly] Kid made me actually tear up in our kitchen with his performance.

Character 10: [breathless] He's absolutely nailing every word, every gesture! [amazed] That's not our goofy boy who puts ketchup on everything. [gentle sob] That's an artist up there, making everyone in this room believe his character's grief completely.

Character 11: [strained whisper] Emily just looked right at us during her bow. [louder, emotional] Did you see that little wave she snuck in? [laughing and crying] She promised she wouldn't do that, said it wasn't professional enough.

Character 12: [warmly] Jake did the same thing, that little rascal! [voice breaking] They planned it, I bet—synchronized parent acknowledgment. [through tears] These kids know exactly how to destroy us emotionally in the best possible way, don't they?

Character 13: [quietly intense] We should do dinner together after, all four of us plus the kids. [more animated] Celebrate properly at that Italian place they love. [gentle] Let them tell us every backstage story while they're still buzzing with adrenaline.

Character 14: [enthusiastically] Perfect idea, yes, absolutely! [calming down] They deserve the full star treatment tonight—flowers, fancy dessert, embarrassing parental speeches. [affectionate laugh] We'll mortify them with our pride, but they secretly love the attention and fuss we make.

Character 15: [reflective tone] You know what amazes me most about all this? [building emotion] How they support each other up there, little touches and encouraging looks. [proud] They're not just castmates; they're genuinely making each other better, braver performers.

Character 16: [agreeing softly] Their friendship shaped who they've become as people. [stronger] From playground adventures to this stage—they've pushed each other forward. [emotional whisper] We're lucky our kids found each other, found this bond that challenges and nurtures them.

Character 17: [suddenly bright] Standing ovation time—come on, get up! [laughing joyfully] My legs are shaky but who cares? [shouting over applause] That's our babies taking their final bow up there, soaking in this perfect moment they've earned!

Character 18: [yelling happily] Emily! Jake! You were absolutely incredible! [voice cracking with pride] Can you hear us over all this cheering? [more quietly] Probably not, but I'll keep shouting anyway because I can't contain this feeling!

Character 19: [breathlessly] My face hurts from smiling, eyes burn from crying. [giddy laugh] Haven't felt this emotional since their first day of school. [tenderly] These milestone moments just grab your heart and squeeze until you can't breathe properly.

Character 20: [contentedly] Same here, completely wrecked in the best way possible. [peaceful tone] Tomorrow they'll be regular kids again, leaving socks everywhere, arguing about video games. [wistful whisper] But tonight, just for tonight, they're absolute stars.

Script: 68f04709 | Role: Character 1 (A)

847 Character 1: [growling] Twenty years, Sal. [louder] Twenty goddamn years we ran this neighborhood together! [Bitter laugh] And now I find out you've been feeding information to the Torrelli family behind my back this whole time.

Character 2: [defensive shout] You think I'm the only rat here? [quieter, venomous] Check your own books, Tommy. [Pause] [spitting words] Your nephew's been skimming off our shipments for months—where you think that money went?

848 Character 1: [shocked whisper] My nephew? [building rage] You're lying through your teeth! [Slamming sound] That kid would never cross me, unlike you, selling us out for what—a bigger cut of the waterfront action?

Character 2: [cold and measured] Bigger cut? [Harsh laugh] I was protecting what was left of our operation. [faster, desperate] The Torrellis were coming for us anyway—at least this way, I thought we'd survive the war.

849 Character 1: [trembling with fury] Survive? [screaming] We're dead men walking now! Every family in the city knows we can't keep our house clean. [lower, menacing] You signed our death warrants with your greed.

Character 2: [mocking tone] Oh, please. [more angrily] You were too busy playing king to notice the wolves circling. [Bitter chuckle] While you counted money in your ivory tower, I watched our soldiers switch sides.

850 Character 1: [through gritted teeth] I trusted you with everything—my business, my family's safety. [voice cracking] My daughter calls you Uncle Sal! [Roaring] How do I explain to her that Uncle Sal got her father killed?

Character 2: [guilty whisper] Leave the kids out of this. [defensive again] You think I wanted this? [more desperately] They had photos, recordings—they threatened my mother at the nursing home, for Christ's sake!

851 Character 1: [disbelieving] Your mother? [Hollow laugh] That's your excuse? We swore an oath on our fathers' graves! [quieter, deadly] Blood before everything else, remember? Or did that mean nothing to you?

Character 2: [exhausted] Blood before everything. [Sarcastic snort] Yeah, that worked real well for Marino, didn't it? [sharper] Found him in pieces last week—still think loyalty means something in this game?

852 Character 1: [quiet rage] Marino was different. He was stealing from the family, not protecting it. [voice rising] But you? [Disgusted exhale] You sold our routes, our contacts, our entire operation's blueprint to our enemies!

Character 2: [pleading] What choice did I have? [angrier] You were making deals with the feds! [Pause] [accusatory] Yeah, I know about your meetings with that FBI agent downtown—who's the real traitor here?

853 Character 1: [stunned silence] [whispering] How did you... [explosive] That was to keep them off our backs! I was feeding them false information about the Torrellis, you idiot! It was all part of the plan!

Character 2: [remorseful] The plan? [voice breaking] What plan, Tommy? [louder, frustrated] You never told me about any plan! All I saw was you meeting with cops while our territory got smaller every month!

854 Character 1: [weary] Because I couldn't trust anyone. [more bitterly] Turns out I was right. [Shaking voice] The paranoia, the sleepless nights—all justified. Even my oldest friend would stick a knife in my back.

Character 2: [wounded] Oldest friend? [getting louder] We stopped being friends when you became boss! [Harsh breathing] I became your employee, your errand boy—taking orders while you forgot who helped build this empire!

855 Character 1: [softly] Is that what this is about? [incredulous shout] Your ego? [quieter, dangerous] People are going to die because you felt disrespected? Our whole crew will be slaughtered within the week!

Character 2: [resigned] They're already dead. [matter-of-fact] The Torrellis are moving tonight. [Pause] [desperately fast] We could run—both of us—take what's left in the safe and disappear before midnight hits!

856 Character 1: [contemplative] Run? [Bitter laugh] After everything we built? [firm resolve] No, if I'm going down, I'm taking every last one of those bastards with me, including the rat who sold us out.

Character 2: [panicked] Tommy, don't be stupid! [quieter plea] We can still fix this! [Shaky breath] Look, we've survived worse—remember the docks in '98? We can get through this if we work together!

857 Character 1: [confused] Hi, I'm calling about my appointment—I think it's Thursday at 2:30? [hesitant] My confirmation number is, uh, K47-B92, but [trails off] the text message says something different about Dr. Peterson?

Customer Support: D2: [professionally] Let me check that for you. [typing tone] I see a K47-B92 for Wednesday, not Thursday, [more carefully] at 3:15 PM with Dr. Martinez at our 4829 Oak Street location.

858 Character 1: [frustrated] No, no, that can't be right—I specifically asked for Thursday because, well, [sighs] I work Wednesdays. [more insistently] And who's Dr. Martinez? I've been seeing Dr. Peterson for three years!

Customer Support: D4: [apologetic] I understand your confusion, sir. [calmly] Dr. Peterson is actually booked through next month, so we assigned you to Dr. Martinez. [reassuring] Would you like me to reschedule for Thursday instead, maybe the 18th?

859 Character 1: [exasperated] The 18th? That's—wait, [groans] that's two weeks away! [pleading] Look, my prescription expired last Tuesday, patient ID number 558921, and I literally can't see properly without my glasses.

Customer Support: D6: [sympathetic] Oh, I see the urgency now. [more helpfully] Let me check... there's a cancellation tomorrow at 11:45 AM, [cautiously] but it's at our North Hills branch, 7661 Maple Avenue—is that too far?

860 Character 1: [relieved] North Hills, that's... [calculating] maybe twenty minutes? [eagerly] Yes, I'll take it! [quickly] But wait, do they accept my BlueCross insurance, plan number BC-44829-X?

Customer Support: D8: [cheerfully] They absolutely do accept BlueCross. [informatively] However, you'll need to arrive fifteen minutes early for paperwork since you're new to that location. [clearly] Your co-pay will be $45, same as Oak Street.

861 Character 1: [worried] Fifteen minutes early means... [mumbles] 11:30. [anxiously] And you're sure, absolutely sure it's tomorrow, November 3rd? [desperately] Because last time there was a mix-up and I waited for an hour.

Customer Support: D10: [confidently] Yes, November 3rd at 11:45 AM, confirmed. [professionally] I'm sending a text to 555-0147—is that still your number? [helpfully] It'll have the address, your confirmation code J89-C21, and Dr. Martinez's direct line.

862 Character 1: [uncertain] That's my old number—no, wait, [correcting] it ends in 0174, not 0147. [sighs heavily] This is why I can't see anything clearly, these numbers all blur together without my glasses.

Customer Support: D12: [understanding] Of course, let me update that—555-0174. [patiently] I've corrected it in our system and the text is sending now. [warmly] Dr. Martinez specializes in prescription updates, so you're in excellent hands.

863 Character 1: [suddenly remembering] Oh God, I just remembered—[panicked] my insurance card says I need referral code from my primary doctor! [frantically] Do I need to call Dr. Walsh's office first, or can you handle that?

Customer Support: D14: [reassuring] No need to panic, sir. [calmly] BlueCross Plan BC-44829-X doesn't require referrals for vision care. [informatively] That's only for specialist visits outside of optometry—you're all set for tomorrow.

864 Character 1: [doubtful] Are you absolutely certain? Because last year at your Riverside office, [frustrated mumble] they made me wait while they called to verify, and—[trails off] actually, maybe that was for something else entirely.

Customer Support: D16: [patiently] I'm looking at your plan details right now. [clearly] Vision care is covered without referrals, including your exam and prescription update. [helpfully] Just bring your insurance card and photo ID tomorrow, nothing else needed.

865 Character 1: [relieved sigh] Okay, okay, so tomorrow, 11:30 arrival for 11:45 appointment. [confirming] North Hills, 7661 Maple Avenue, Dr. Martinez, confirmation J89-C21. [chuckles nervously] I should probably write this down somewhere.

Customer Support: D18: [cheerfully] Perfect summary! [kindly] The text message will have all those details too. [additionally] If you need to cancel or change anything, call us before 9 AM tomorrow; otherwise, there's a $35 fee.

866 Character 1: [grateful] Thank you so much for your patience—I know I'm probably, uh, [embarrassed] not the easiest customer today. [sincerely] These blurry weeks have been really frustrating, honestly.

Customer Support: D20: [warmly] Not at all, that's what we're here for! [encouragingly] After tomorrow's appointment, you'll be seeing clearly again. [friendly] Have a great rest of your day, and we'll see you at North Hills tomorrow morning!

867 Customer Support: Good afternoon, this is Sarah with HomeGuard Warranty Services, how can I— Oh, I see you're calling about claim number 47829. Unfortunately, that claim has been denied due to, uh, pre-existing damage conditions.

Character 1: [frustrated] Pre-existing? Are you kidding me? [louder] We've had this warranty for three years and never had issues with the water heater! [groans] How is a sudden leak somehow pre-existing?

868 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir, I really do. According to our technician's report dated last Tuesday, there was significant rust and— corrosion present that indicates long-term deterioration, not covered under your policy terms.

Character 1: [incredulous] Your technician was here for five minutes! [sarcastically] Five whole minutes to determine years of damage? [more angrily] I've been paying $89 a month for what exactly—the privilege of being told no?

869 Customer Support: Sir, our technicians are fully certified and trained to identify— Look, I can escalate this to my supervisor if you'd like. But honestly, the decision rarely changes once the initial assessment is complete.

Character 1: [bitterly] Oh great, pass the buck to someone else who'll tell me the same thing. [pause] [more controlled] You know what? Yes, escalate it, because this is absolutely ridiculous.

870 Customer Support: I'll need to place you on a brief hold while I— Actually, wait, let me check something first. Sometimes if there's documentation of regular maintenance, we can file an appeal through a different department.

Character 1: [hopefully] Documentation? [more eagerly] I have every receipt from the plumber who's serviced it annually! [firmly] Would that actually help, or are you just trying to get me off the phone?

871 Customer Support: No, no, this could actually work in your favor. If you can email those receipts to claims-review@homeguard.com, I'll— I'll personally flag it for expedited review within 24 hours.

Character 1: [skeptically] You'll personally flag it? [sighs heavily] Fine, I'll send everything I have. [more seriously] But if this gets denied again, I'm canceling this worthless warranty and telling everyone I know about this experience.

872 Customer Support: Sir, before you consider that, please know that— [more calmly] Once we receive your documentation, there's a strong chance for reversal. I'm noting your account now with my direct extension, 2847.

Character 1: [tiredly] Extension 2847, got it. [more firmly] Sarah, right? I'm holding you to this 24-hour timeline. [resigned] I just need hot water back before my in-laws visit this weekend.

873 Customer Support: Oh, in-laws visiting without hot water would be— [chuckles nervously] That's definitely urgent. I'm marking this as priority and, between you and me, mentioning the weekend deadline in my notes.

Character 1: [surprised] You're actually being helpful now. [more warmly] Thank you for that, I— [sighs] I'm sorry for getting heated earlier, this has just been incredibly stressful.

874 Customer Support: Trust me, I get at least ten calls like yours daily. [more quietly] The system isn't perfect, but— Send those receipts with "Attention Sarah" in the subject line, it'll come straight to me.

Character 1: [relieved] Alright, I'm pulling them up on my computer right now. [curiously] Can I ask you something? How often do these appeals actually get approved?

875 Customer Support: [hesitantly] Well, I shouldn't really say specific numbers, but— With proper maintenance documentation? About seventy percent get overturned, especially for water heaters.

Character 1: [hopefully] Seventy percent? That's actually— [more energetically] Okay, that gives me hope. [determinedly] I'm sending everything now, including photos I took before your technician arrived.

876 Customer Support: Photos too? Perfect, that definitely helps our case. Once I receive them, I'll call you directly with an update, no need to— to wait on hold or explain everything again.

Character 1: [gratefully] Sarah, you've turned this whole situation around. [chuckles] Started ready to cancel, now I'm actually feeling optimistic. [sincerely] Thanks for actually listening and not just reading from a script.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

877 [Disappointed] I mean, we literally said seven-thirty, and it's—what, almost nine now? [Sigh] I dunno why I even bother making reservations anymore.

878 [Sarcastic] Oh wow, you're actually here! [Chuckle] Should I, like, mark this historic moment in my calendar or something?

879 [Happy] You know what, I'm just gonna start telling you the wrong time—like, two hours early! [Laugh] Problem solved, right?

880 [Angry] This is the third time this week you've left me sitting here like an idiot! [Groan] I'm done, seriously.

881 [Whisper] Everyone's staring at me 'cause I've been alone at this table for forty-five minutes. [Tsk] It's honestly embarrassing.

882 [Fast] Okay so next time—and I mean this—next time you're late, I'm leaving, no questions asked. [Disappointed] I gotta draw the line somewhere.

883 [Sad] I just... I feel like my time doesn't matter to you, y'know? [Sigh] That's what it feels like.

884 [Shout] Are you kidding me right now?! [Angry] The movie started an hour ago!

885 [Slow] You ever notice how, um, how I'm always the one waiting? [Disappointed] [Tsk] It's kinda becoming a pattern here.

886 [Chuckle] My other friends have started taking bets on how late you'll be. [Sarcastic] Jerry won twenty bucks last week, so thanks for that.

887 [Happy] [Fast] Actually, being early gave me time to—oh wait, you wouldn't know what that's like, would you? [Laugh]

888 [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if you're late on purpose, like maybe you just... don't wanna hang out anymore.

889 [Angry] [Fast] Don't even—don't you dare give me the traffic excuse again, we both know you left your house ten minutes ago!

890 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Let me guess, your alarm didn't go off, or wait—no, your cat had an emergency, right?

891 [Disappointed] I already ate, paid the bill, and basically had dinner with the waiter instead. [Sigh] He was actually pretty interesting, so... thanks?

892 [Shout] [Happy] Hey, you made it before midnight! That's gotta be some kind of record! [Laugh]

893 [Tsk] You realize the surprise party was, uh, supposed to be a surprise, right? [Angry] She got here before you did!

894 [Sad] [Slow] I used to defend you when people called you flaky, but I'm kinda running out of excuses here.

895 [Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh no no, take your time, I'm just—I'm literally aging while I wait, but sure, stop for coffee!

896 [Whisper] Honestly? [Sigh] I've started bringing a book everywhere 'cause I know—I just know you're gonna be at least half an hour late.

897 SCENARIO: Excited about a job lead, then worried it won't work out, then gets a call to schedule an interview

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my God, okay, so you know how I've been like obsessively checking LinkedIn? Well I finally, I finally found something that's actually— it's perfect. Like this marketing coordinator position at that nonprofit I was telling you about, the one that does the, um, the environmental stuff?

[enthusiastic] 

And I know someone who works there! Remember Jake from college? He's like been there for two years and he said he could put in a good word for me, which is— that's huge, right? That's like exactly what I needed.

[worried] [faster]

But now I'm like spiraling because what if, what if his good word doesn't actually mean anything? Like what if they're just being polite and they already have someone internal or— God, what if I'm not even qualified enough? The posting says two years experience and I only have like one and a half if you're being generous...

[anxious]

And I keep refreshing my email every five minutes like some kind of— [nervous laugh] I sent my application yesterday morning and I know that's like no time at all but I just— I can't stop thinking about it and—

[surprised] [brightening]

Oh! Oh wait, that's— my phone's ringing and it's a number I don't know. Should I— I think I should answer this, right?

[excited] [relieved]

Oh my God, that was them! They want to schedule an interview for Friday! [laugh] I can't believe it, this is actually happening!
