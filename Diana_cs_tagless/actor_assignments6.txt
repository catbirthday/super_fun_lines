Character 1: You invited Marcus.

477 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know how this looks, but I swear I didn't think he'd actually come? Like, I invited a bunch of people and he was just—I mean, I didn't specifically invite him, it was more of a group text situation and—

Character 1: To my birthday thing.

478 Character 2: Wait wait wait, it's not—okay yes, technically it's your birthday thing but I thought—[nervous laugh] I honestly thought he wouldn't show up. He literally never comes to anything anymore.

Character 1: But you still invited him.

479 Character 2: I didn't—ugh, okay, I guess I did but it wasn't like... deliberate? You know how I am, I just kinda added everyone from the usual group and I wasn't thinking—I'm so sorry, I wasn't thinking about how that would make you feel.

Character 1: Right. You weren't thinking.

480 Character 2: No no no, that came out wrong. I mean—I was thinking, just not... properly? Like my brain was on autopilot and I—god, this sounds so stupid. [sigh] I really really messed up, didn't I?

Character 1: Yeah. You did.

481 Character 2: I can uninvite him! I'll—I'll text him right now and just say something came up or—or that we had to change the plans or something. Would that help? I wanna fix this.

Character 1: It's a little late for that, don't you think?

482 Character 2: You're right, you're—you're totally right. That would probably make it worse, honestly. Um, what if I—okay, hear me out—what if I plan something different? Like just us and the core group, no Marcus, somewhere he definitely won't be?

Character 1: So now I have to change my plans because you screwed up?

483 Character 2: No! No, that's not—ugh, I'm making this worse. [groan] I'm sorry, I'm just trying to—I dunno, make it right somehow? You have every right to be pissed at me. I'm literally the worst friend.

Character 1: You're not the worst. Just... thoughtless sometimes.

484 Character 2: I know, I know I am. And I hate that about myself, y'know? Like I genuinely don't mean to be but then I do stuff like this and—I promise I'll be better. I'll actually think before I do things, especially when it comes to you and... him.

Character 1: I just wanted one night without having to see him.

485 Character 2: Of course you did. Of course. And I—I took that away from you and that's so unfair. You deserve to celebrate without having to worry about your ex being there. I'm really, really sorry. Like from the bottom of my heart sorry.

Character 1: I know you are. It's just... hard.

486 Character 2: I get it, I totally get it. And I'll—I'll handle it, okay? I'll make sure you two don't have to interact at all. I'll literally be your human buffer the entire night if you want me to. Whatever you need.

Script: 51ea5515_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You were rude to Alex last night.

487 Character 2: I wasn't—okay, maybe I was a little short with them, but honestly? I'm just looking out for you. You've been together what, two months? And already they're trying to control who you hang out with?

Character 1: They're not controlling anything.

488 Character 2: Come on, seriously? They literally got upset because you wanted to have one night with your friends. That's—that's not normal, okay? And I'm supposed to just smile and pretend everything's fine?

Character 1: You didn't have to be mean about it.

489 Character 2: Mean? I barely said like five words to them all night. [Scoff] Look, I'm sorry if I wasn't super friendly, but I'm not gonna fake being best friends with someone who I think is—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.

Character 1: You're right. I don't.

490 Character 2: See, this is what I'm talking about! You used to actually listen when I had concerns about stuff. Now it's like—Alex says jump and you're already in the air. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, I'm worried about you.

Character 1: Worried. Sure.

491 Character 2: Yeah, worried! Is that so hard to believe? We've been friends for how long? And suddenly I'm the bad guy because I don't immediately love your new partner who, by the way, has been kinda sketchy about their whole situation?

Character 1: What's that supposed to mean?

492 Character 2: I mean—look look, their story keeps changing. First they were "between jobs," then they were freelancing, now they're starting a business? [Frustrated laugh] And you're paying for everything, which—fine, your money, but come on.

Character 1: Not your business.

493 Character 2: It is when you're borrowing money from me last week! I'm not—okay okay, I shouldn't have brought that up. But you gotta understand why I'm not exactly thrilled about this whole thing, right?

Character 1: So you decided to be passive-aggressive instead.

494 Character 2: I wasn't passive-aggressive, I was just... distant. There's a difference. And honestly? I thought I was being pretty restrained considering I wanted to say something way more direct about the whole situation.

Character 1: How noble of you.

495 Character 2: That's—[groan] you know what? Fine. I'm sorry I wasn't nicer to Alex. There. But I'm not sorry for being concerned, and I'm definitely not gonna pretend I like them when I don't. That's not who I am.

Character 1: Then maybe we need some space.

496 Character 2: Are you—are you serious right now? You're gonna throw away our entire friendship over someone you barely know? Because I was a little cold at dinner? I mean, if that's what you want, fine fine, but that's on you, not me.

Script: 69f9a470_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about what you did at dinner last night.

497 Character 2: Oh god, I know—I know exactly what you're gonna say and you're right. I shouldn't have mentioned Tyler, I just—the story was so relevant and I wasn't thinking and—

Character 1: Third time this week.

498 Character 2: Wait, third? I mean—okay yeah, you're right. Monday at coffee, Wednesday at your place, and then... [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever, aren't I? I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time.

Character 1: You told everyone about the camping trip story. His camping trip story.

499 Character 2: I—that's not—okay I did but it wasn't about him, y'know? It was just funny and I thought—no, you're right. It was his story. I shouldn't have. I'm sorry, I really am.

Character 1: Do you still talk to him?

500 Character 2: What? No! No no no, absolutely not. I haven't talked to Tyler since you guys—I would never do that to you. I just have this stupid habit where I can't filter what comes out of my mouth [nervous laugh] and apparently that includes your ex.

Character 1: It's been four months. I'm trying to move on.

501 Character 2: I know, and you're—you're doing so well, honestly. Like, you're amazing. And here I am just... sabotaging everything because I can't shut up about—god, I'm so sorry. I genuinely don't mean to bring him up, it just happens.

Character 1: Maybe you miss him more than I do.

502 Character 2: That's not—no, that's ridiculous. I mean, sure, we were all friends but—okay wait, that came out wrong. What I'm trying to say is, you're my priority here, not him. Always you.

Character 1: Doesn't feel like it.

503 Character 2: Yeah, I... I get that. [sigh] I really messed up, huh? It's like—I dunno, sometimes I forget that mentioning him actually hurts you because you seem so okay, but that's—that's not an excuse. I should know better.

Character 1: I'm not okay. I just got good at pretending.

504 Character 2: Oh. Oh man, I—I didn't realize. That's... I'm making everything worse, aren't I? Every time I bring him up it's like—it's like I'm ripping off a bandaid or something. God, I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: You're not an idiot. Just... thoughtless sometimes.

505 Character 2: Yeah, that's—that's fair. More than fair, actually. Look, I'm gonna try harder, okay? Like, really try. Maybe you could, um, give me a signal or something if I start doing it again? Just like, kick me under the table or whatever?

Character 1: Or you could just stop talking about him entirely. Novel concept.

506 Character 2: Right. Yeah. Obviously that's—that's the actual solution here. No more Tyler stories, no more Tyler references, no more anything Tyler-related. I promise. And I mean it this time, I swear. You deserve so much better from me as a friend.

Script: f048be3b_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told Marcus about my diagnosis.

507 Character 2: I—okay, yes, but you weren't answering anyone's calls for like three days and we were all freaking out. I didn't know what else to—I mean, someone had to know what was going on.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

508 Character 2: Look look, I get that you're pissed, but you literally disappeared after getting that news. What was I supposed to think? That you were just, I dunno, taking a mental health break? [Scoff] Come on.

Character 1: It was private.

509 Character 2: And I—I respect that, usually, you know I do. But this wasn't some random gossip thing. Marcus was gonna drive to your apartment to check if you were even alive. I was trying to stop him from doing something worse.

Character 1: So you just decided for me.

510 Character 2: That's not—ugh, you're making it sound so calculated. It wasn't like that. I was scared, okay? Like genuinely [frustrated laugh] terrified that something had happened to you. Sorry for caring, I guess.

Character 1: Don't do that.

511 Character 2: Do what? Be honest about being worried? You're acting like I posted it on Facebook or something. It was one person—one person who was also losing his mind about you.

Character 1: My medical information. Mine.

512 Character 2: I know! I know it's yours, and I shouldn't have—but also, you shouldn't have just vanished without telling anyone you were okay. That's kinda messed up too, if we're being honest here.

Character 1: I needed time.

513 Character 2: And I—I get that, I really do. But three days? No response to like forty texts? You can't just drop a bomb like that and then disappear and expect everyone to be—to just sit there and wait patiently.

Character 1: So my privacy means nothing.

514 Character 2: That's not what I'm saying and you know it. [Sigh] Your privacy matters, obviously, but so does—I mean, we're supposed to be friends. Friends don't let friends spiral alone.

Character 1: Friends don't share medical information.

515 Character 2: Okay okay, fine. You're right. I messed up. But I'm not gonna apologize for being worried about you when you literally gave us every reason to think—whatever. You obviously don't wanna hear it.

Character 1: No. I don't.

516 Character 2: Great. So we're just gonna—you're gonna stay mad forever then? Because I made one mistake while trying to make sure you didn't—you know what, forget it. I'm done defending myself for giving a shit.

Script: 2da2cc87_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about yesterday.

517 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I've been thinking about this all night. I know I messed up when you were telling me about the work thing and I just... I kept saying it wasn't that bad, right? That's—that's what this is about?

Character 1: And last week. And the week before that.

518 Character 2: Wait wait wait, I didn't—okay, you're right. You're totally right. I keep doing this thing where you tell me something and I'm like "oh but at least" or whatever and I just [nervous laugh] I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time, y'know?

Character 1: You told me I was overreacting. About my dad.

519 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I mean, I said you might be reading too much into it but that's not the same as—actually, no, you're right. God. That's literally the same thing, isn't it? I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: I just wanted you to listen.

520 Character 2: I know, I know. And instead I kept trying to like... fix it? Or make you feel better by saying it wasn't so bad? Which is so stupid because obviously that doesn't—that's not helpful at all. [Sigh] I think I thought I was helping but I was just... wasn't I?

Character 1: You made me feel like my feelings didn't matter.

521 Character 2: Oh my god, no—your feelings absolutely matter. They matter so much and I'm—I'm honestly horrified that I made you feel that way. Like, you're one of my best friends and I just kept... basically telling you that you were wrong about your own feelings? That's so messed up.

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

522 Character 2: I think I—okay this isn't an excuse, but maybe I was projecting? Like when I'm upset I want someone to tell me it's gonna be okay, but that's not—that's not what you need and I should've actually listened instead of just... talking over your feelings.

Character 1: I've tried telling you before.

523 Character 2: You did. You literally did and I just—I remember now, you said you needed me to just listen and I said "of course" and then I kept doing the exact same thing. [Groan] I'm like the worst friend ever, aren't I?

Character 1: Not the worst. Just... frustrating sometimes.

524 Character 2: I wanna—I really wanna do better. I mean it. Maybe I could like, literally put tape over my mouth next time? Kidding, but seriously, I'm gonna try so hard to just... shut up and listen. You deserve that. You deserve someone who actually hears you.

Character 1: That would be nice, yeah.

525 Character 2: And if I start doing it again—which I probably will because apparently I have zero self-awareness—just like, tell me to stop? Call me out immediately? I promise I won't get defensive or anything, I just... I genuinely don't realize when I'm doing it.

Character 1: Okay. I can do that.

526 Character 2: Thank you. For telling me, I mean. And for—for not just giving up on me entirely even though you'd have every right to. I'm really, really sorry. Like truly. I'm gonna work on this, I promise.

Script: eafb2b8f_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: The app idea. In the meeting. Really?

527 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know how it looked. I know. But I was trying to—I mean, I mentioned you! I said "we" like five times, I swear I did.

Character 1: No. You didn't.

528 Character 2: Wait wait wait, I—okay maybe not in that exact moment but I was gonna circle back to it! The boss just kept asking questions and I got caught up in explaining everything and—[nervous laugh] shit, I really didn't mention you at all, did I?

Character 1: "My latest project." That's what you called it.

529 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, those words came out but I didn't mean it like—ugh, I'm such an idiot. I got nervous! You know how I get when everyone's looking at me, I just start talking and talking and—

Character 1: You got a promotion.

530 Character 2: I know. I know, and honestly? I feel sick about it. Like literally haven't eaten since yesterday because my stomach is just—I wanna give it back. I'll tell them tomorrow it was your idea, all of it.

Character 1: Sure you will.

531 Character 2: I will! I mean it—I'm gonna march in there first thing and—actually no, I'll email them right now. [groan] God, they probably think I'm some creative genius when really I just... I stole from my best friend. That's what I did, isn't it?

Character 1: Yeah. It is.

532 Character 2: I'm so sorry. Like, I can't even—there's no excuse, y'know? I just... I panicked and then it snowballed and suddenly everyone was clapping and I couldn't figure out how to stop it without looking like a complete fraud.

Character 1: But you are a fraud.

533 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, I am. You're right. I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever and I don't blame you if you never wanna talk to me again but please, just... let me fix this? Please?

Character 1: How long did we work on that pitch? Three months?

534 Character 2: Three months and twelve days. I know because I—I kept track of every late night, every coffee run, every time you stayed up fixing my stupid coding errors. You did like ninety percent of the work and I just... presented it. [quieter] I presented it like it was mine.

Character 1: I trusted you.

535 Character 2: I know. And I—I broke that, didn't I? Completely shattered it for a stupid promotion that I don't even—I don't even want it if it means losing you as a friend. Nothing's worth that.

Character 1: You'll tell them tomorrow. First thing. Everything.

536 Character 2: First thing, I promise. And I'll—I'll put it in writing too, make sure there's documentation that it was your concept, your execution, your everything. I just... I'm really, really sorry. I hope you can forgive me. Eventually, I mean. Whenever you're ready. If you ever are.

537 SCENARIO: discovering they've been walking the wrong direction

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I need to— I need to find, um, Maple Street, and it should be coming up soon because I've been walking for like— [sigh] how long have I been walking?

[slower, uncertain]

Wait. Wait wait wait. That building, I— I think I passed that building before? Like, um, like twenty minutes ago? But that doesn't— that doesn't make sense because I've been going straight this whole time.

[slight realization creeping in]

Oh no. Oh, um, oh no no no. I think I— [groan] I think I went the wrong way when I left the coffee shop. I was supposed to go, uh, I was supposed to go left, wasn't I? Not right?

[frustrated but resigned]

Great. So I've been walking in completely the wrong direction for— for how long? Half an hour? This is, um, this is why I should just use my phone like a normal person instead of trying to, uh, trying to navigate like it's 1995.

[pragmatic, sighing]

Okay, so, um, I guess I just— I just turn around and walk all the way back? [tsk] At least I'm getting my steps in today, right? That's, uh— that's the silver lining here.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: f64e901c | Role: Character 1 (A)

538 Character 1: [shaking voice] There ain't no other way, Jake. [bitter] The bank's coming tomorrow with the sheriff, and I'd rather see it burn [choking up] than watch them vultures pick apart what Pa built with his bare hands.

Character 2: [quiet resignation] I know it, Sam. [steadier] Twenty years we've worked this land, through drought and storms. [voice breaking] Ma's buried out back under that oak—can't let strangers trample over everything we've loved.

539 Character 1: [harsh laugh] Remember when we thought we'd pass this place to our kids? [softer] Now look at us, holding torches like common outlaws. [determined growl] But they won't get the satisfaction of taking what's ours.

Character 2: [nostalgic whisper] That front porch where Pa taught us to whittle, [louder] the barn we raised with the whole county helping. [Shuddering breath] Every board holds a memory that'll turn to ash tonight.

540 Character 1: [urgently] We gotta do it now before I lose my nerve. [trembling] My hands are shaking something fierce, Jake. [more firmly] But watching them auction our home would kill what's left of my soul.

Character 2: [hollow tone] The horses are already moved to Thompson's place. [increasingly agitated] Grabbed Ma's Bible and Pa's rifle—everything else stays. [Bitter chuckle] Let the bank inherit ashes and regret, nothing more.

541 Character 1: [weeping openly] God forgive us for what we're about to do. [angry shout] But those bastards left us no choice! [quieter] They took everything else—our savings, our dignity, our future.

Character 2: [steadying breath] Light the barn first, then the house. [mechanical] We'll watch from the ridge until it's done. [voice cracking] Then we ride west and never look back, brother.

542 Character 1: [disbelieving] Can't believe it's really ending like this. [faster] All those years fighting weather, disease, raiders—survived everything except a banker's greed. [Hoarse whisper] This land was supposed to outlive us both.

Character 2: [philosophical tone] Maybe it's better this way, Sam. [growing stronger] The homestead dies with us, on our terms, proud and defiant. [Dry laugh] Least we're choosing how our story ends.

543 Character 1: [suddenly urgent] You hear that? [panicked] That's horses coming up the trail! [commanding] Light it now, Jake—throw the torch and let's ride before they get here!

Character 2: [determined grunt] It's catching on the hay. [awestruck] Look how fast it spreads, like the wood's been waiting. [more quietly] Strange how something so terrible can look so beautiful against the night.

544 Character 1: [yelling over flames] The roof's going up! [desperate] We should go, but I can't look away. [Sobbing] Twenty years of my life turning to smoke, and I can't even look away.

Character 2: [distant voice] The heat's reaching us even up here. [melancholy] You can see it for miles, probably—our final message to the county. [stronger] We weren't beaten; we just refused to play their game.

545 Character 1: [exhausted whisper] It's collapsing now, the whole frame. [more animated] Remember building that addition when Mary was born? [Ragged breath] Took us three months, and now it's gone in three minutes.

Character 2: [grimly satisfied] Let them explain this to their bosses back East. [quieter] "The property you foreclosed on? [Mocking tone] Sorry, sir, but there ain't nothing left except scorched earth and stubborn ghosts."

546 Character 1: [sudden realization] Jake, we're outlaws now, you know that? [nervous laugh] Arson's a hanging offense in this county. [resigned] But I'd rather swing than live knowing they won in the end.

Character 2: [firmly] We did what we had to do. [emotional] Pa would understand—he always said a man's home is his castle. [Choked laugh] Well, we just chose to burn our castle down.

547 Character 1: [growing distant] Time to ride, brother. [steadier] New Mexico, maybe California—somewhere they don't know our names. [wistful] Somewhere we can forget the sound of everything we loved turning to nothing.

Character 2: [final whisper] Take one last look, Sam. [stronger] Remember it burning, not broken and sold. [Shaking voice] Now let's go, before the smoke in our eyes ain't from the fire anymore.

Script: 399295a7 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Excuse me, I'm looking at my statement and there's a—um—a charge for $47.82 labeled "Temporal Adjustment Fee"? [nervously] I've had account number 773-4429-B for six years and I've never seen anything like this.

548 Customer Support: Let me pull up your account, 773-4429-B, one moment please. Oh, that's... unusual. It appears this fee was applied on October 23rd at exactly 3:33 AM, which is, well, outside our normal processing hours.

Character 1: [increasingly worried] But that's not even the strangest one! There's another charge here for—[pause]—for $92.17 called "Lunar Synchronization Surcharge" dated November 1st. [exasperated] What does that even mean?

549 Customer Support: Sir, I'm seeing these charges in our system but they're showing origin code ZX-99Q, which isn't——which isn't actually in our fee schedule. This shouldn't be possible.

Character 1: [frustrated] And yesterday, I got charged three times for something called "Reality Maintenance" at $18.18 each! [louder] My balance went from $2,847.50 to $2,684.33, but the math doesn't even add up right!

550 Customer Support: Mr. Henderson, I need to escalate this immediately. These fee codes are appearing as "Department 7-Alpha" authorized, but we don't have a Department 7-Alpha. At least, not that I know of.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, phantom departments now! [sighs heavily] Look, I just want my $286.52 back—wait no, it says here $287.52—[confused again] the number keeps changing while I'm looking at it!

551 Customer Support: Sir, are you at 1842 Maple Street right now? Because our system shows you're simultaneously logged in from there and from coordinates that——that don't correspond to any known address.

Character 1: [alarmed] How do you know my address? I never gave—[gasps] Hold on, my app just sent me a notification saying "Thank you for visiting Branch #∞." [shakily] I'm standing in branch #14 on Oak Avenue!

552 Customer Support: [increasingly disturbed] Mr. Henderson, I'm going to—to transfer you to our specialized department. Please hold while I connect you to extension 0000. They'll know what to do about the interdimensional fees.

Script: de4b347a | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] We've been sitting here for forty-five minutes! [louder] Nobody's told us anything about why we're not moving. [sighs heavily] I have a job interview in an hour—this is completely unacceptable.

553 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir, and I'm truly sorry about the delay. We're experiencing signal failures at the junction ahead, but our engineers are—they're working on it right now. Should be resolved shortly.

Character 1: [sarcastically] "Shortly?" You said that twenty minutes ago! [more angrily] Every single week it's something else—signals, leaves, the wrong kind of rain. [groans] How is this railway still functioning in the twenty-first century?

554 Customer Support: Sir, we operate thousands of services daily, and the vast majority run on time. Today's issue is, well, it's beyond our control—electrical equipment failed. [sighs] I can't make the trains move faster than safety allows.

Character 1: [incredulous] Safety? [scoffs] We're literally sitting still! My interview is at Thornton Industries—do you know how hard it was to get that opportunity? [desperately] Can't you at least tell me exactly when we'll move?

555 Customer Support: Current estimate is fifteen to twenty minutes, though I can't guarantee that timeframe. Look, I'll—I'll write you a delay certificate for your employer. [quickly] That should help explain the situation to them.

Character 1: [bitterly] A piece of paper won't get me the job back if I miss this interview. [exasperated] Why don't you people communicate these delays before we board? [more loudly] I could've taken a taxi an hour ago!

556 Customer Support: The signal failure occurred after departure, sir—we couldn't have predicted it. If you'd like to file a formal complaint, there are forms at the station. But right now, I need to update other passengers.

Character 1: [mockingly] Oh yes, the famous complaint forms that disappear into the void! [groans loudly] I've submitted three this month alone. [defeated] What's the point anymore—nothing ever changes, nothing ever improves around here.

557 Customer Support: Sir, complaints are reviewed by management, and compensation is available for delays over thirty minutes. I know it's frustrating—believe me, we don't enjoy this either. We're doing everything possible to get you moving.

Character 1: [sarcastically] "Everything possible" except maintaining your infrastructure properly, apparently. [sighs] You know what? Just forget it. [muttering] I'll probably lose this opportunity because of your incompetent service.

558 Customer Support: I've noted your concerns, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. The delay certificate will be time-stamped, which should help your case. We are genuinely sorry about your interview situation.

Character 1: [desperately] Can you at least call ahead to the next station? [pleading] Maybe they could arrange alternative transport—a bus, anything? [more quietly] This job could change my entire life, you understand?

559 Customer Support: I wish I could, but we don't have those arrangements for individual passengers. Once we arrive, station staff might—they might be able to suggest local taxi services. [gently] That's the best I can offer.

Character 1: [angrily] This is exactly why people are abandoning trains for cars! [more loudly] Unreliable, expensive, and zero accountability! [scoffs] "The best you can offer"—that says it all, doesn't it?

560 Customer Support: Sir, I understand you're upset, but taking it out on me won't solve anything. [more firmly] I'm just doing my job here, trying to help everyone through this delay. Please, let's keep this civil.

Character 1: [resigned] Civil? While my career prospects evaporate? [chuckles bitterly] Fine, fine—I'll be civil while everything falls apart. [exhausted] Just... please tell me we're actually moving soon.

561 Customer Support: Actually, I've just received word—we should be moving in the next five minutes. Signal's been partially restored, so we'll proceed at reduced speed. [more optimistically] You might still make your interview.

Character 1: [skeptically] Five minutes, then reduced speed... [calculating] That's still cutting it incredibly close. [urgently] Will we make up any time, or—or are there more delays ahead? [anxiously] Please, just be honest with me.

562 Customer Support: [honestly] We'll do our best to make up time where safely possible, but I can't promise anything. What I can say is—we're priority cleared through the next three stations. That should help considerably.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

563 [Happy] Look, I know it sounds kinda scary, but that's exactly why you should—I mean, when else are you gonna get this chance? [Laugh]

564 [Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified the first time too, but then it was like... [Fast] everything just clicked, y'know?

565 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, just keep doing the same boring stuff forever—that sounds super fulfilling. [Tsk]

566 What if I told you that, um, literally everyone who's tried this has said it changed their perspective on—on everything, basically?

567 [Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I just thought you'd be more... adventurous than this, honestly.

568 [Shout] This is your chance to finally break out of that rut you're always complaining about! [Happy] Come on!

569 [Fast] Okay so here's the thing—it's only twenty minutes, it's completely safe, and if you hate it we can just—we'll leave immediately, alright?

570 [Sad] I really wanted us to, uh, to share this experience together, but I guess if you're not interested... [Sigh]

571 Remember when you made me try sushi and I was all weird about it?

572 [Angry] Stop making excuses—you're just, you're scared and you won't admit it! [Groan]

573 [Chuckle] The instructor is actually really cute, so there's that, I mean—not that it matters, but y'know...

574 [Slow] [Disappointed] Fine, I'll just... I'll go by myself then, I guess.

575 You're literally the one who said you wanted to be more spontaneous this year, right?

576 [Happy] Trust me, your Instagram is gonna look so good after this—wait, that came out wrong, but seriously! [Laugh]

577 [Sarcastic] Yeah, because sitting on your couch watching Netflix for the fifth weekend in a row is working out great for you. [Tsk]

578 [Whisper] I already kinda signed us both up, so... [Fast] please don't be mad but the deposit was non-refundable!

579 [Sad] [Sigh] It's just—I dunno, I thought you'd at least consider it before shooting it down completely.

580 What's the absolute worst thing that could happen—like really, actually think about it for a second?

581 [Angry] [Shout] Would you just stop overthinking everything for once in your life?!

582 [Slow] Sometimes the best things in life are the ones that, um, that terrify you a little bit first, y'know? [Chuckle]

583 SCENARIO: Frustrated about no parking, then a spot opening up right in front

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my God, don't even get me started on today. I had to drive downtown for that meeting, right? And I'm circling around for like— I'm not even kidding, like twenty minutes just looking for a stupid parking spot.

[increasingly agitated]

Every single street, just full. And you know how those meters are like three dollars an hour now? [scoff] So I'm getting more and more stressed because I'm gonna be late and I'm gonna have to pay like a fortune just to park.

[exasperated]

I literally drove past the same like, I don't know, hot dog cart guy like four times. He probably thought I was stalking him or something. [groan] And I'm sweating because my AC is busted and I'm just getting so—

[surprised]

Wait, hold on. Someone's— oh my God, someone's literally walking to their car right now. Right in front of where I need to be.

[amazed] [relieved]

They're pulling out! Like, this never happens to me, ever. I have the worst parking luck in the world usually, and this guy is just— he's just leaving, right when I need it most.

[happy] [slightly incredulous]

I swear it was like the universe finally decided to cut me some slack. [laugh] Went from wanting to scream to feeling like I won the lottery in like two seconds.
