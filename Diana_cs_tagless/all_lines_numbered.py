1  So I got into grad school.
2  The one at State. For psychology.
3  I don't know. Maybe. It's expensive.
4  Not yet.
5  I should be excited. I worked hard for this.
6  It was. Two years ago when I applied.
7  What if I'm not smart enough? What if everyone there is better?
8  You have to say that. You're my friend.
9  That was basic stuff.
10  Great. So I'll have no friends.
11  Three weeks. You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
12  So you just disappeared instead.
13  Tried to bring what up?
14  You could have tried.
15  Yeah. I did.
16  Your therapist?
17  That's what this was about? Therapy?
18  You thought I'd judge you for getting help?
19  I've been in therapy for two years.
20  Because it's normal. Not something to run away from your friends about.
21  You forgot my birthday.
22  It was three days ago.
23  You remembered Jake's birthday last month.
24  I texted you that morning.
25  You could've said something when you did see it.
26  Twenty years. We've been friends for twenty years.
27  I was there for your mom's surgery.
28  Right.
29  Are you still my friend?
30  Not one mistake. One important thing.
31  You brought Jamie.
32  You could've told me.
33  That's not the point.
34  I'm not asking you to pick sides. I'm asking for a heads up.
35  At my birthday dinner?
36  Do you?
37  Never said you were a villain. Just a shitty friend.
38  You created drama anyway.
39  That's not your call to make.
40  I need some space.
41  I know, I know how long you were—look, I wanted to come, okay? I did. But hospitals are just... [exhale] they're really hard for me. Like, really hard.
42  Don't—don't do that. Don't just say "right" like that. You know about my anxiety, I've told you about the whole thing with my mom and—I mean, I literally can't even drive past one without feeling like I'm gonna throw up.
43  That's not—okay okay, that's not fair. Everyone else doesn't have panic attacks in medical settings. I texted you every day, I sent food, I called—I was trying to be there in the ways I could, y'know?
44  No, it's not the same, you're right. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I just... forgot about you or something. [scoff] Like I was just hanging out, having a great time while you were there.
45  Are you serious right now? I was—I was literally worried sick about you the entire time. I couldn't sleep, I was checking my phone constantly for updates, I was—honestly, this is really unfair.
46  And I needed to not have a complete breakdown in your hospital room! That's—that would've made everything worse, wouldn't it? Me hyperventilating while you're trying to recover?
47  I did try! I got—I got all the way to the parking garage twice. Twice. And both times I just... I couldn't. [frustrated laugh] But sure, yeah, I guess that doesn't count as trying.
48  Wow. Okay. So basically nothing I did matters because I couldn't physically be in that room. The daily check-ins, the—the care packages, asking your sister for updates every few hours, none of that counts.
49  Oh, come on, don't—don't do the past tense thing. Look look, I'm sorry I couldn't be there the way you wanted. I am. But I was drowning in my own stuff and trying—trying really hard to support you anyway.
50  That's... [sigh] okay, I get that you're hurt. I do. And maybe—maybe I should've pushed through it somehow, I dunno. But I'm also disappointed that after everything, you can't see that I was doing my best. Even if my best wasn't enough.
51  [muttering] Oh. Oh no. When did I— when did I last water the, um, the plants? Because they're looking a little, uh— they're looking a little sad over there, and I'm pretty sure it's been, like, what, three days? Four days?
52  [overly cheerful] So, I've been reviewing your project proposal and [pause] I have some thoughts. [speeding up] Actually, quite a few thoughts—about the formatting, the font choice, even the margin width seems a bit off, don't you think?
53  [condescending] Well, before we get to content, [slower] let's talk about your color choices on slide seventeen. [sharp exhale] The blue is too blue, if you know what I mean? Maybe try a softer shade?
54  [defensive] No need to get snippy! [louder] I'm just trying to help you succeed here. [patronizing tone] Speaking of which, did you remember to run spell check? I always find at least three errors when I look.
55  [dismissive laugh] Sarah's great but she misses things. [rapid-fire delivery] Also, why didn't you CC me on the Tuesday email, the Wednesday follow-up, and that Thursday check-in? [accusatory] I need to be looped in on everything, remember?
56  [flustered] Must be a glitch in my email then. [quickly changing subject] Anyway, back to page four—I'm thinking we need more buzzwords. [enthusiastic] Synergy, optimization, leverage! [demanding tone] Can you work those in by tomorrow morning?
57  [oblivious] Perfect! [sing-song voice] Oh, and one more tiny thing—I noticed you used Arial instead of Calibri on the footnotes. [tsking sound] These details matter, you know. It shows attention to excellence.
58  [nervous chuckle] There's that attitude again! [faster pace] Look, I stayed until nine last night reformatting your tables. [martyred tone] They were off by at least two pixels, maybe three. You're welcome, by the way.
59  [defensive shouting] The budget's complicated! [quieter] These things take time to perfect. [building up again] Unlike your proposal, which you slapped together in what, two weeks? [scoffing] Rush jobs always need my fixes.
60  [wounded tone] That rejection wasn't about quality! [scrambling words] The client just didn't understand our vision. [getting higher pitched] But fine, do it your way. Just don't blame me when this falls apart tomorrow.
61  [fake hurt] I detect sarcasm. [lecturing tone] You know, this kind of resistance to feedback won't help your performance review. [warning voice] Team players accept guidance gracefully, even about minor details like... everything I've mentioned.
62  [concerned] Oh my, are you alright? [professionally] This is Iron Fist Gym on 4425 Madison Avenue. We do have several class levels available—our beginner program starts at just $89 per month. [gently] But first, did you say you don't remember what happened?
63  [sympathetically] Oh dear, that must have been frightening! [more upbeat] Well, our stress-relief boxing program might be perfect for you. [warmly] We have three levels: Fundamentals at $89, Intermediate at $125, and our Advanced Fighter package at $175 monthly.
64  [reassuring] Fundamentals is definitely the gentlest option, perfect for your situation. [cheerfully] Equipment rental is an extra $15 monthly, but your first pair of gloves is complimentary! [curiously] Unfortunately, ID JF90887 won't transfer, but I can set you up with a new account right now.
65  [apologetically] We don't directly bill insurance, but we can provide receipts for HSA reimbursement. [helpfully] Many clients use their flex spending! [enthusiastically] Also, if you sign up today with promo code KNOCKOUT50, you'll get 50% off your first month, making it just $52 initially.
66  [laughing gently] I see the irony! [professionally] Monday 6 AM is perfect—that's instructor Jake's class in Studio B. [warmly] Just bring your doctor's clearance to reception, and we'll get you started with student number TKO-2024-1198. [encouragingly] You're going to love it!
67  [cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling StreamMax support, my name is Jennifer. [quickly] How can I assist you with your viewing experience today?
68  [sympathetically] Oh, I completely understand how frustrating that must be. [more briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick and we'll get this sorted—can I have your email address associated with the account?
69  [professionally] Thank you, Mr. Johnson, I see your account here. [quickly] First thing, have you tried restarting your router? [more gently] I know it sounds basic but it resolves about seventy percent of streaming issues.
70  [apologetically] Right, sorry about that, just had to check. [briskly] What device are you streaming on and, um, what's your current internet speed—do you know?
71  [quickly] Absolutely, that's plenty of speed for our service. [thoughtfully] Let me check if there's any, uh, service interruptions in your area—what's your zip code?
72  [concerned] I'm not seeing any outages in Beverly Hills area. [more quickly] Can you tell me what quality setting you have selected in the app—is it on auto or manual?
73  [reassuringly] No, no, absolutely not, let me walk you through it. [briskly] Go to settings, then playback settings, and tell me what you see there.
74  [quickly] Try switching it to "Good" instead of "Best"—I know it sounds backwards but [more explanatory] sometimes the auto-detection gets confused and tries to stream 4K when your connection fluctuates.
75  [apologetically] It's temporary, just to test if that's the issue. [more firmly] If it works, we can troubleshoot why the higher quality isn't streaming properly—might be a DNS issue or bandwidth throttling.
76  [relieved] Great! Now let's fix it properly. [quickly] I'm going to send you some advanced settings to change—check your email in about two minutes, and also [more carefully] I'm crediting your account for this month.
77  [Happy] Oh my god, is this—wait, this is Mr. Buttons! [Laugh] I thought Mom threw him out like twenty years ago!
78  [Slow] You know, I used to, um, carry this thing everywhere when I was little. [Sad] [Sigh] God, where does the time even go?
79  [Whisper] Don't judge me, but I kinda still remember all the adventures we went on together. [Chuckle]
80  [Fast] Wait wait wait, this can't be the same one—look, it's even got the burn mark from when I tried to give it superpowers! [Happy]
81  [Disappointed] It's so much smaller than I—I mean, I guess everything seemed bigger back then, right? [Tsk]
82  [Angry] Why would Dad keep this in the attic all these years and not, like, tell me? [Groan] I literally asked about it last Christmas!
83  [Sarcastic] Oh great, now I'm gonna cry over a stuffed dinosaur like I'm five years old again. [Slow] Real mature.
84  [Sad] I remember when Grandma gave me this—she said it would, um, it would protect me from bad dreams. [Whisper]
85  [Shout] No way! [Fast] This thing's gotta be worth something now—vintage toys are like, super collectible, aren't they?
86  [Chuckle] My kids are gonna think I'm absolutely insane when I tell them Mommy used to talk to this thing for hours. [Happy]
87  [Slow] The fabric still smells like our old house, y'know? [Sigh] Like mothballs and, uh, something else I can't quite place.
88  [Disappointed] I thought finding this would feel more—I dunno, meaningful or whatever. [Fast] But it's just a dirty old toy.
89  [Angry] [Shout] This is what started that huge fight between me and Sarah in second grade!
90  [Whisper] Honestly, I'm kinda scared to touch it—what if it, like, falls apart or something? [Slow]
91  [Sarcastic] Sure, let's just unpack thirty years of childhood trauma with one moldy teddy bear. [Tsk] [Disappointed] This day keeps getting better.
92  [Happy] [Fast] I gotta call Mom right now—she's not gonna believe I actually found where she hid it!
93  [Sad] You were my best friend before I learned how to, um—before real friends were even a thing. [Slow] [Sigh]
94  [Laugh] Remember when I tried to give you a haircut and basically—yeah, that didn't go well, did it? [Happy]
95  [Groan] Ugh, the amount of times I made everyone pretend this thing could talk at dinner. [Sarcastic] [Fast] I was such a weird kid.
96  Oh god, oh no—what did I—wait, the cookies? The cookies had peanuts? I'm so sorry, I didn't even think to check, I just grabbed them because they looked really good and I thought—
97  [excited] Oh my God, okay, so you know how I've been like obsessively checking LinkedIn? Well I finally, I finally found something that's actually— it's perfect. Like this marketing coordinator position at that nonprofit I was telling you about, the one that does the, um, the environmental stuff? [enthusiastic] And I know someone who works there! Remember Jake from college? He's like been there for two years and he said he could put in a good word for me, which is— that's huge, right? That's like exactly what I needed. [worried] [faster] But now I'm like spiraling because what if, what if his good word doesn't actually mean anything? Like what if they're just being polite and they already have someone internal or— God, what if I'm not even qualified enough? The posting says two years experience and I only have like one and a half if you're being generous... [anxious] And I keep refreshing my email every five minutes like some kind of— [nervous laugh] I sent my application yesterday morning and I know that's like no time at all but I just— I can't stop thinking about it and— [surprised] [brightening] Oh! Oh wait, that's— my phone's ringing and it's a number I don't know. Should I— I think I should answer this, right? [excited] [relieved] Oh my God, that was them! They want to schedule an interview for Friday! [laugh] I can't believe it, this is actually happening!
98  I know, I know, and that's—that's terrifying actually? Like when you put it that way, I realize how badly I keep messing this up. It's not just forgetting, it's like... it's your life, y'know?
99  I'm gonna—I'm gonna put it in my phone right now. Like, literally setting reminders and everything. [groan] God, I should've done this months ago. I don't know why I'm like this, my brain just doesn't—that's not an excuse though.
100  The pad thai with the—yeah. Yeah, I did say that. And then the birthday cake thing happened and I just... I dunno why it doesn't stick in my head. It's like I know you have allergies but then someone offers food and my brain goes completely blank.
101  No! No no no, that's not it at all. I care—I care so much, honestly. You're one of my best friends and I keep putting you in danger because I'm just—I'm careless, I guess? Not on purpose but that doesn't make it better.
102  You shouldn't have to. Like, you really shouldn't. That's on me, completely on me, and I—wait, I'm gonna write it on my hand right now too. Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. That's all of them, right? [sigh] See, the fact that I'm even asking...
103  And soy! Fuck, I'm—I'm the worst friend. I'm literally the worst. You've told me a hundred times and I still can't get it right. I don't blame you for being mad, I'd be furious if someone kept doing this to me.
104  That's—okay when you say it like that... I've been treating this like some minor thing, haven't I? Like "oops, forgot again" but it's not—it's actually serious and I've been so stupidly casual about your actual safety.
105  I'm gonna—I'm gonna fix this. For real this time, not just saying it. Maybe we could, um, go through a list together? Of safe restaurants and brands and stuff? So I have it all written down and I can actually be a decent friend for once?
106  What? No no no, that's not—okay, I know how it looked but I swear that's not what happened. I was trying to explain to everyone that it wasn't anybody's fault and then—
107  I was gesturing! I was just—my hands were moving while I talked, you know how I get when I'm nervous. And Mark was like "whose idea was it" and I kinda froze and I—[nervous laugh] okay yeah, my hand might've been in your direction but—
108  Okay fine, it was. It totally was pointing at you but I didn't mean—I wasn't trying to blame you! I was literally about to say that we all decided together but then everyone just assumed and started talking over me.
109  I tried! I mean—I wanted to, but then Jessica started going off about accountability and I just—I panicked. [Groan] God, I'm such a coward. I shoulda said something right then, I know.
110  I'm gonna fix this, okay? I'm gonna tell everyone tomorrow that it was actually—that you had nothing to do with it. I'll explain everything, I promise. I'll literally send a group text right now if you want.
111  No, it's not too late! People forget stuff like this, honestly. And I'll—I'll make sure they know the truth. Um, actually, wait—I already texted Mark like an hour ago trying to explain. He hasn't responded yet but—
112  Yeah! Yeah, as soon as I realized how bad it looked, I messaged him. And I'm gonna talk to Jessica tomorrow in person 'cause she's the one who really—she's the one spreading it around the most, y'know? [Sigh] I really didn't mean for this to happen.
113  I know, I—that's totally fair. I just freeze sometimes when everyone's staring at me and I can't—the words just don't come out right. But that's not an excuse, I know it's not. I really messed up and I'm so, so sorry.
114  I know. God, I know and I feel—I feel terrible about it. Like genuinely sick to my stomach. You're one of my best friends and I just... I let you down. I'm gonna make this right though, I swear. Whatever it takes.
115  I will. I promise I will. And there's gonna—wait, does this mean you're not completely done with me? 'Cause I thought—I was worried you'd never wanna talk to me again after this. [quieter] I really am sorry. Like, from the bottom of my heart.
116  Oh god, your jacket—okay, so, um, I definitely have it. I mean, I borrowed it last week for that thing, remember? And I was totally gonna bring it back but then—wait, actually let me check my car real quick.
117  No no no, I know how this looks. I'm not—I'm not trying to steal your stuff, I swear. I'm just really, really bad at remembering to return things and that's [nervous laugh] that's on me, totally on me.
118  The book! Right, I still have that too—god, I'm the worst. Like literally the worst friend ever. I keep meaning to gather everything up and bring it all back but then I—I dunno, I just space out completely. It's not an excuse, I know.
119  Oh no. Oh no no no, did you—was it for something important? [Groan] Please don't tell me it was for your date. It was for your date, wasn't it? I'm so sorry, I didn't even think about—
120  I feel terrible. Like, genuinely awful right now. You must think I'm doing this on purpose but I'm not—I would never. It's just that my brain is basically Swiss cheese lately and I can't keep track of anything, y'know?
121  You're right. You're absolutely right, it's not. I'm making excuses when I should just be—okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm driving home right now, grabbing literally everything of yours, and bringing it straight back. Today. Within the hour.
122  I know I know, but last time I—wait, no, see I'm doing it again. No excuses. [Sigh] I honestly don't blame you for being mad. I'd be furious with me too. Actually, I kinda am furious with myself.
123  You'll have it. I promise—actually, no, promises don't mean anything at this point, do they? Um, how about this: I'm gonna text you photos of everything I've gathered up before I leave my place. Like proof that I actually have it all ready.
124  And maybe—maybe we need like a system or something? Like I give you collateral when I borrow stuff? God, that sounds so stupid when I say it out loud but I clearly can't be trusted with the normal way of just, y'know, being a responsible adult.
125  Right. Yeah, of course. I'm—I'm leaving right now. Literally walking to my car as we speak. And I really am sorry. Like, deeply, truly sorry. I know I've been a crappy friend about this and you deserve better. [quieter] Way better.
126  Oh god, okay—so, um, this is gonna sound really bad but just let me explain the whole thing first? I was at the park taking those photos I told you about, right? And I—I swear I had it in my bag.
127  Wait wait wait, I didn't—well, I mean, technically yes but it's not like I was careless or anything! I literally had it zipped up in the front pocket and then when I got home it just wasn't—[groan] okay that sounds worse out loud.
128  I know. Oh my god, I know, I'm like—I'm literally sick about it. I've been back to the park three times already looking for it, I called the lost and found, I posted in all the local Facebook groups—
129  No no no, don't say that! I'm gonna—I'm gonna find it, I promise. Or I'll replace it! I mean, I know I can't actually replace it 'cause of the sentimental value and everything but I could try to find the same model? [nervous laugh] I've been checking eBay all morning.
130  Yes. God, yes, of course I do. That's why I feel so—that's why this is killing me, y'know? You trusted me with it and I just... I completely messed up. I'm so, so sorry.
131  You're—you're right. I mean, no, you were being a good friend and I—I let you down. Badly. Like, this is probably the worst thing I've ever done to you and I just... I dunno how to make it right.
132  I know, I know. And then I lose it in one day like an idiot. [sigh] I honestly—I can't even look at myself in the mirror right now. I keep replaying everything trying to figure out where it could've—actually, wait, did I tell you I'm gonna check the coffee shop too?
133  [casual] So you know how Sarah's been posting like twenty Instagram stories a day about her juice cleanse? [light laugh] I finally just— I unfollowed her. Like, I still follow her main account, but I muted her stories because I cannot see one more photo of green sludge, you know? [conversational] And then of course I got curious, right? Like, does she notice when people unfollow? So I may have... checked her follower count a couple times today. [sheepish] Which is ridiculous, I know, but I was bored. [a bit concerned] But then I noticed she unfollowed me back? Which, okay, fine, whatever, that's fair I guess. People notice these things apparently. [more worried] And I'm scrolling through Twitter and— oh wait. [pause] Wait, hold on, she just posted something. "Some people really show their true colors when you're trying to better yourself." [nervous laugh] [anxious] That's— that's about me, right? Oh god, that's definitely about me. The timing is too weird. She's subtweeting about unfollowing her stupid juice stories! [spiraling] [groan] Why did I even do that? Now I look like some bitter friend who can't handle her wellness journey or whatever. This is so much worse than just seeing the smoothie posts! Ugh, I've become Instagram drama! [exasperated] Over juice!
134  Then I'll keep looking! Seriously, I'm not giving up on this. Even if it takes me weeks, months, whatever—I'm gonna make this right. And um, even if you never forgive me, which I'd totally understand, just... know that I'm really, truly sorry.
135  Really? You'll come? Oh thank god—I mean, thank you. I promise I'll—from now on, I'm never borrowing anything from anyone ever again. Literally nothing. Not even a pencil.
136  [defensive] I already told you, I was at Jake's house. [getting louder] We were just playing video games and lost track of time, okay? [frustrated sigh] Why do you always assume I'm lying about everything?
137  [panicked] Wait, she must have been confused! [speaking faster] Maybe she meant to call someone else's mom, there were other kids there too. [nervous laugh] You know how she gets mixed up sometimes with all those names.
138  [quieter] That's from walking past some people smoking outside. [defensive mumbling] And Sarah hugged me goodbye, she always wears too much perfume. [pleading] Mom, you're making this into something it's not, I swear to you.
139  [caught off-guard] I meant... a different Sarah! [stammering] From my chemistry class, you don't know her. [desperately] Look, fine, we went to this small get-together at Mark's house but nothing bad happened, I promise!
140  [defiant shout] Why can't you just trust me for once! [voice cracking] Everyone else's parents let them have a normal life! [resentful] You treat me like a prisoner, no wonder I have to sneak around sometimes!
141  [whining] Mom, please, you're being completely unreasonable! [more urgently] I need my phone for school and work tomorrow! [frustrated groan] Okay, okay, there was alcohol there but I didn't drink any, I was responsible!
142  [quickly defensive] No, nothing like that! [calmer] Everyone was being safe, some people stayed over, others got rides. [earnestly] Mom, I made good choices, I didn't drink or do anything stupid, isn't that what matters?
143  [desperate] This is so unfair! [voice breaking] I came home safe, I didn't do anything wrong except go to a party! [bitterly] You wonder why I don't tell you things? This is exactly why!
144  [panicking] No, please don't tell Dad! [bargaining quickly] I'll do extra chores, I'll stay home every weekend for a month! [desperately sincere] Mom, I'm sorry I lied, I just knew you'd overreact exactly like this!
145  [defeated mumble] You did raise me better. [remorseful] I know I messed up with the lying part. [quietly pleading] Can we please just talk about this without Dad? I'll tell you everything that happened, the whole truth.
146  [professionally] Absolutely, I can help clarify those warranty options for you. [cheerful] So with that model, you have the standard one-year manufacturer warranty, plus we offer our store protection plan. [reassuring] Did you purchase any extended coverage when you bought it?
147  [understanding tone] Let me pull up your purchase under your phone number. [focused] Can you confirm it's 555-0123? [more clearly] Ah yes, I see you enrolled in our TechShield Plus which covers accidental damage for three years, replacement guarantee, and includes annual tune-ups.
148  [enthusiastically] Actually yes, accidental damage from handling is included! [in a lighter tone] Your coverage code TSP-2024-11-QN65 specifically covers drops, spills, and yes—flying toy incidents. [chuckles] However, it doesn't cover intentional damage or, um, pet-related disasters beyond normal accidents.
149  [helpful] You'd actually call our dedicated TechShield hotline at 1-888-SHIELD1. [more patiently] They're available 24/7 and your member ID is TS-45892-K. [reassuring voice] Just have that ready when you call, and they'll dispatch a technician within 48 hours usually to your Oak Street address.
150  [clarifying tone] Yes, you did opt for Premium Setup! [friendly] Our team should've contacted you to schedule that—typically within 3-5 business days of purchase. [more seriously] Since today's November 22nd, they probably already called? [helpfully] Check for a voicemail from 555-SETUP, that's 555-73887.
151  [reassuring] No additional charges for rescheduling! [upbeat] Let me call them right now from extension 4421 and see what slots they have available. [thoughtfully] With Thanksgiving coming up, we should get you scheduled before the holiday rush really hits.
152  [confirming] Exactly right, the $538.98 covers your TechShield at $189.99, Premium Setup at $99.99, and you also got the premium HDMI cable kit. [in detail] That's model CBL-4K-10FT for $49 plus the wall mount bracket WM-65-ADJ for $199.99.
153  [sympathetic] I understand the sticker shock. [encouraging tone] But that mount is rated for up to 100 pounds and includes tilt and swivel features. [more enthusiastically] Plus with your TechShield plan, if the mount fails, we cover any damage to your TV—that alone could save you the full $1,299.99.
154  [muttering] Okay, so I need to, um— I need to send this email, but does this sound... I don't know, does this sound weird? "I hope this finds you well." That's— that's normal, right? [slightly uncertain] Actually, wait, let me— let me read this again. "As per our previous conversation..." Hmm. [tsk] That sounds, um, that sounds kind of snotty? Like, "as per"— who says "as per"? I mean, I do, apparently, but— [faster, second-guessing] Maybe I should just say "like we talked about" instead? But that's too casual for, uh, for Janet from accounting. She's very— she's very proper. Very, um, very email-formal. [drawn out, conflicted] But "I wanted to follow up" sounds like I'm being pushy, right? Like, aggressive? I don't want to be that person who's like, constantly— constantly poking people about stuff. [resigned, quieter] You know what? I'm overthinking this. It's just— it's just an email about the quarterly reports. Janet's not gonna, um, she's not gonna psychoanalyze my word choices. [exhale] Probably. [decisive but still uncertain] Okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna send it. It's fine. It's, uh, it's professional. That's... that's what matters, right?
155  [confident] They'll call within the hour to your number ending in 0123. [warmly] They have slots available tomorrow and Saturday between 8am and 6pm. [cheerful closing] And remember, once it's mounted, you have free calibration service for the first year—just call with code CAL-2024-FREE!
156  [professionally] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your recent premium notice. [quickly] Yes, I can definitely help explain the increase—let me just pull up your account here and, um, we can go through everything together.
157  [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, truly. [more quickly] The increase is actually market-wide—we've seen rising repair costs, medical expenses are up thirty percent, and [pause] unfortunately these factors affect everyone's rates.
158  [gently] You're absolutely right, everything's more expensive now. [briskly] Let me check what discounts we can apply—are you still, um, working from home? [hopeful] We have new low-mileage options that could save you fifteen percent.
159  [quickly] Actually, three days qualifies you for our hybrid work discount! [more enthusiastically] Plus, if you bundle with homeowners—wait, do you have that with us? [pause] We could potentially get you back closer to your original rate.
160  [reassuringly] It's actually much easier than you'd think! [rapidly] We handle all the paperwork, coordinate the switch date, and—here's the thing—bundling would save you about [calculating] two hundred monthly across both policies.
161  [firmly] No catch, same coverage levels exactly. [more slowly] The savings come from the multi-policy discount, plus that hybrid work reduction, and [quickly] honestly, we really value long-term customers like yourself.
162  [confidently] No long-term contracts whatsoever! [briskly] You can adjust or cancel anytime—we keep customers by, you know, actually providing value. [chuckles lightly] Not by trapping them with contracts.
163  [efficiently] Absolutely, I'm preparing that right now actually. [quickly] I'll include both the standalone auto rate and the bundled option, with all applicable discounts itemized—should be in your inbox within five minutes.
164  [enthusiastically] Perfect timing to ask! [rapidly] We have a good student discount, defensive driving course credits, and if she's using a car with our safe-drive monitoring app, that's another [calculating] ten to fifteen percent off her portion.
165  [diplomatically] I understand the concern about privacy, really. [more reassuringly] The app only tracks driving behaviors—speed, braking, that sort of thing—not locations or destinations. [quickly] It's completely optional but the savings are substantial.
166  [Disappointed] So, um, I really gotta—I mean, my parking meter's definitely expired by now. [Fast] I should probably go check on that before I get a ticket.
167  [Whisper] Hey, uh, I think my phone's been vibrating for like ten minutes straight? [Nervous laugh] [Sigh] Someone's probably wondering where I am.
168  [Sarcastic] Wow, this is—this is fascinating, truly, but my cat's gonna starve if I don't leave right now. [Tsk]
169  [Happy] Oh! [Fast] You know what, I just remembered I've got that thing—the thing I told you about last week? [Chuckle] Yeah, I should really run!
170  [Slow] Listen, I'm gonna have to, uh... [Sigh] [Disappointed] I'm gonna have to stop you right there because I genuinely can't be late again.
171  [Angry] Okay, I've been trying to—look, I've said "goodbye" three times already! [Groan] I really need to go!
172  [Sad] I wish I could stay and hear the rest, honestly, but I'm just—I'm exhausted. [Slow] Maybe we can continue this another time?
173  [Fast] [Happy] Right, so basically my Uber's here and the driver's texting me like crazy, so I'm just gonna—yeah, bye!
174  [Whisper] Can I just—sorry, but I really have to use the bathroom. [Fast] Like, urgently. [Nervous laugh]
175  [Shout] MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE! [Laugh] No, I'm kidding, but seriously though, I do need to leave.
176  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Mhmm, yeah, absolutely riveting stuff here, but, uh, my dentist appointment was actually twenty minutes ago, so...
177  [Disappointed] You're not really picking up on my hints, are you? [Tsk] [Fast] I've been edging toward the door for literally five minutes now.
178  [Sad] I don't wanna be rude or anything, but I'm kinda—I mean, I'm getting a migraine? [Sigh] I just need to go lie down.
179  [Angry] [Fast] No, no, no, we're not doing the whole story again—I heard it the first time! [Groan] I'm leaving!
180  [Happy] Oh my god, wait—is that the time? [Laugh] [Fast] I totally forgot I'm supposed to pick up my kid from school!
181  [Slow] [Whisper] So, um, this is awkward, but my ex just walked in and I really can't—yeah. [Tsk]
182  [Sarcastic] Let me just, uh, let me just stop you right there—fascinating as your cousin's wedding drama is... [Sigh] [Disappointed] I've got actual work to do.
183  [Shout] [Happy] ANYWAY! Great talk! Gotta bounce! [Laugh] See ya!
184  [Slow] I'm gonna be honest with you here—I stopped listening about ten minutes ago? [Chuckle] [Sad] My brain's just completely fried today.
185  [Fast] [Angry] Y'know what, I'm just gonna—I'm walking away now, like literally walking away, because apparently saying "bye" doesn't work! [Groan]
186  I know, I—god, I know. I'm so sorry. I kept meaning to come, I swear I did, but then—okay that sounds terrible. That's not—let me start over.
187  No no no, please, just—just let me explain. I was gonna come that first weekend, right? But then my mom had that thing and I thought, okay, I'll go Monday. But Monday turned into Tuesday and then—[groan] I'm the worst friend ever.
188  I deserve that. I totally deserve that. I just—I got so caught up in my own stupid stuff, y'know? Like work was insane and I kept thinking I'd have more time later, but that's not an excuse. Nothing is.
189  I know. Even Jake came and he lives like three hours away. I'm—I'm literally twenty minutes from the hospital and I couldn't—god, I really messed up, didn't I? [nervous laugh] Like majorly, majorly messed up.
190  Oh god. Oh god, that's—I'm so sorry. I should've at least called. I wanted to but then I felt guilty for not visiting and then I felt like calling would be worse somehow? Like insulting? I dunno, that's so stupid, I'm so stupid.
191  I know. I mean—no, I don't know, but I can imagine and I—you shouldn't have been alone. You shouldn't have had to wonder where I was. I'm supposed to be your best friend and I just... wasn't there.
192  I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. There's literally nothing I can say that makes this okay, is there? I just—I wanna fix this but I don't know how. Tell me what to do. Please.
193  But I did care! I do care! I thought about you constantly, I just—I couldn't make myself go. [sigh] Hospitals kinda freak me out since my dad, but that's not—that's my problem, not yours. I should've sucked it up.
194  No, don't—don't make excuses for me. That was five years ago, I should be over it by now. And even if I'm not, even if hospitals make me wanna throw up, I should've been there. You needed me and I wasn't there.
195  [casual] Oh my god, you know what's, um, what's embarrassing? I have this tab that's been open on my laptop for like— like three weeks now? Maybe more? [light laugh] I don't even, uh, I don't even remember what it is anymore, but I just— I just keep it there, you know? Like it's become part of the, um, the landscape at this point. [conversational] It's like having a, uh, a weird digital pet or something. I see it every day and I'm like "oh hey, mystery tab, how's it going?" [chuckle] But I never actually, um, never actually click on it because what if it's something really boring? Like what if it's just— I don't know, like a, uh, a recipe for banana bread that I'll never make? [slightly curious] But okay, you know what? I'm— I'm gonna look right now. I'm curious. Let me just— [pause] let me just click on this thing and see what, um, what past me thought was so important that I— [realization dawning] Oh. Oh no. Wait, this is— [sharp exhale] this is the, uh, the registration form. For the conference. The one that was— oh god, when was the deadline? Let me just— [panic building] It was yesterday! The deadline was yesterday! I've been staring at this stupid tab for three weeks and it was the— the one thing I actually needed to do! [groan] I'm such an idiot! How do I— how do I even function as a human being? [spiraling] [frustrated laugh] Three weeks! I could have done it any day for three weeks and instead I just— I just let it sit there like some kind of, of digital decoration! [defeated] I'm never gonna get into this conference now. This is— this is peak me right here.
196  It—it was good! I mean, okay, maybe not great great, but it wasn't bad either. You're acting like I completely lied to you or something.
197  That's not—[scoff] come on, that's not fair. I was trying to be supportive, y'know? You were so nervous about it and I didn't wanna pile on when you were already stressed.
198  And I gave you feedback! I told you about the slides and the—the timing thing. I just didn't mention every single little issue because honestly? I didn't think you wanted to hear it.
199  Okay okay, fine, but you gotta understand—you literally came to me right after, all excited, and you were like "did I do okay?" What was I supposed to say? [frustrated laugh] "Actually, no, you bombed it"?
200  But that's not what happened! It was—look, it was fine, it just wasn't as good as you thought it was. There's a difference between being honest and being cruel, y'know?
201  No you didn't—okay, maybe it was a little rough, but nobody's thinking about it as much as you are. Seriously. Everyone's forgotten about it already.
202  Your boss is—[sigh] okay, I didn't know they were gonna be there. If I'd known that, I would've been more... I dunno, more direct about stuff. But you made it sound like just a practice run.
203  You didn't not say it either! Look look, I'm sorry you're upset, I am, but I was trying to help. Maybe I didn't do it perfectly, but at least I was there, right?
204  And being a friend means—means sometimes protecting people from stuff they don't need to hear! You can't just expect me to be brutally honest all the time when you're clearly not ready for it.
205  Because I know you! And honestly? The fact that you're this upset kinda proves my point. You say you want honest feedback but then when things go wrong, you're acting like I'm the bad guy for trying to spare your feelings.
206  I know, I know how it looks, but I was literally—my mom was in the hospital, okay? I couldn't just drop everything and—I mean, I wanted to be there, but I physically couldn't.
207  That's—okay, that's not entirely fair. I was barely keeping it together myself. [Sigh] You're acting like I just decided to ignore you for fun when I was sitting in the ICU watching my mom on a ventilator.
208  Because I didn't wanna dump that on you while you were going through your thing! I figured—I dunno, I thought I was doing the right thing by not making it about me. Apparently that was wrong too.
209  I didn't disappear, I just—look look, I get that you're hurt, but come on. I was trying to handle my own crisis without making yours worse. [frustrated laugh] Can't exactly win here, can I?
210  You're right, okay okay, you're right about that. I should've—I mean, I could've sent something. But honestly? I wasn't thinking straight. I was just trying to survive each day, y'know?
211  Well I wasn't. I literally wasn't even on my phone for like three days straight. And now you're—fine, be mad, but don't act like I deliberately abandoned you when I was drowning too.
212  And that's—[scoff]—that's exactly the problem, isn't it? One time, ONE time I can't be there, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?
213  So was my mom possibly dying! Jesus. I'm sorry I couldn't be in two places at once. I'm sorry I'm not—I dunno, superhuman or whatever you apparently need me to be.
214  Then what? What did you mean? Because honestly, it feels like you're punishing me for having my own emergency at the wrong time, which—that's pretty messed up actually.
215  And I needed to make sure my mom didn't die alone. [quieter] Look, I'm—I'm sorry I wasn't there. I am. But I'm not gonna apologize for prioritizing that. I just... I can't.
216  I know, I know—god, I'm so sorry. I just—your mom was being so intense and I froze up, okay? I wanted to say something, I really did, but she just kept going and going and I—[nervous laugh] I completely chickened out.
217  That's not—okay, yeah. Yeah, she was being awful. And I should've—I mean, I literally had like ten different things I wanted to say but my brain just... shut down? You know how I get around parents.
218  Please don't—I mean, you're right. You're absolutely right. I failed you and I—I've been feeling sick about it since Saturday. Like genuinely nauseous thinking about how I just sat there like an idiot while she said all that stuff about your job and your choices and—ugh, I'm the worst friend ever.
219  I keep replaying it in my head, y'know? Like all the things I should've said. How I should've been like "actually, Mrs. Chen, that's not fair" or—or something. Anything. [groan] But no no no, I just smiled and nodded like a coward.
220  What? No! I don't—oh my god, I didn't even think about that. She probably—oh no. That makes it so much worse. I was just trying to be polite but that's—that's not an excuse, I know that's not an excuse.
221  I know how that sounds—wait, that came out wrong. I wasn't choosing her over you, I swear I wasn't. I just—I dunno, I got so uncomfortable and my default is to just... avoid conflict? Which is stupid, I know it's stupid, especially when someone's attacking my best friend right in front of me.
222  I know. I know it did and I—[sigh] I can't imagine how alone you must've felt. Like, your own mom going at you like that and then me just... abandoning you basically. That's what I did, right? I basically abandoned you when you needed me.
223  You're right. You're totally right and I—I wanna make this right somehow. I mean, I can't go back and fix it but maybe I could talk to her? Like separately? Tell her how wrong she was and how amazing you're actually doing and—okay, I'm rambling but I just really really need you to know how sorry I am.
224  Yes! God, yes, absolutely. I should've—that's what I should've done in the first place instead of sitting there like a deer in headlights. And honestly? I've been practicing what I'm gonna say. Like literally talking to myself in the mirror about how your choices are valid and she needs to respect them.
225  Really? You'd—you'd let me try? Because I swear I won't freeze up this time. I've got your back, I promise. I know I should've had it before and I completely failed but—but I'm gonna fix this. Or at least try to. You deserve that, you deserve so much better than how I acted. [quieter] I'm really, really sorry.
226  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I need a snack. I need— I definitely need something because I'm, like, I'm gonna crash in about ten minutes if I don't— [sigh] Alright, what do we got here? [slightly more focused] So there's, um, there's the usual suspects. Chips, obviously. But like, do I want— do I want salty or do I want sweet? Because I had that really bland sandwich for lunch and I'm thinking maybe sweet would be— but then again, uh, salt sounds really good right now. [considering] Ooh, okay, Snickers. Classic. Can't go wrong with— but wait, didn't I just have chocolate yesterday? I feel like I did. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with— [tsk] I'm not on a diet or anything, I just— [second-guessing] Maybe pretzels? Those are like, healthy-ish, right? Well, not healthy but, um, less bad? [laugh] Less bad, great criteria there. Very scientific. But they're so— they're so dry, and I don't have water with me, so— [decisive, then wavering] You know what, Snickers. I'm doing it. I'm— [pause] unless... do they have those trail mix things? The ones with the, uh, the little chocolate bits? [hmm] That's like compromise food. Best of both worlds. [resigned but satisfied] Nah, forget it. Snickers it is. Sometimes you just gotta— you just gotta go with your gut, right? B4. Here we go.
227  [nervously] So, um, I have something to tell you. [clearing throat] Remember how I've been feeling weird lately? [whispered] I took a test this morning, and... I'm pregnant. Like, actually pregnant. Two pink lines pregnant.
228  [urgently] Take it! Take it right now! [pleading tone] I'll wait with you in the bathroom. [soft squeal] Can you imagine if we were pregnant together? That would be the most us thing ever to happen!
229  [soothing voice] Just breathe with me. [inhale] [exhale] Everything's going to be fine either way. We've been through worse, remember? Like that time we got food poisoning in Cabo and thought we were literally dying together.
230  [stunned silence] [barely audible] Two lines. [SHRIEK] TWO LINES! You're pregnant! We're both pregnant! At the same time! This is absolutely crazy! How did this even happen? Well, I know HOW, but like, the timing!
231  [giddy whisper] Wait, wait, let's just sit with this for a second. [dreamy tone] Just us two. [sniffling] Before the chaos starts, before the planning and panic. Right now it's just our little secret miracle.
232  [excitedly fast] Oh God, the cravings! The matching bumps! [squealing] The joint baby shower! We can do those cheesy maternity photos together! You know, the ones we always made fun of but secretly wanted to do anyway!
233  [overwhelmed] This is so surreal. [voice breaking] Last week we were complaining about being tired all the time. [soft laugh] Now we know why! The universe really said "plot twist" and delivered hard, didn't it?
234  [worried whisper] Are you scared? [rushed words] Because I'm terrified but also the happiest I've ever been. [shaky voice] It's like every emotion at once. Is this normal? Please tell me you feel it too.
235  [through happy tears] I love you so much. [hiccup laugh] Our kids are going to have the best aunt ever. [getting louder] Oh my God, we're going to be moms! Actual moms! With actual tiny humans depending on us!
236  [suddenly practical] Okay, we need a plan. [determined] Doctors appointments, vitamins, telling our families. [giggling nervously] My mom is going to absolutely lose her mind. Yours might actually faint. Should we tell them together too?
237  [professionally] I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with your windows. [sympathetic] Let me pull up your account—that's WX-4521-B, correct? [reassuring] I see here you had six double-pane units installed on October 15th at 1842 Maple Street.
238  [understanding] I completely understand your frustration, and that certainly shouldn't be happening with our EcoSeal Pro series. [helpful tone] Can you tell me which specific windows are affected? [gently] We'll need to schedule a technician to assess the installation and check the weatherstripping.
239  [apologetically] That sounds absolutely terrible, and I'm making detailed notes in your file right now. [more firmly] Under warranty EW-2023-7749A, you're covered for installation defects. [reassuring] Our next available appointment slot is Thursday at 2 PM, or we have Friday morning at 9:30.
240  [more apologetically] I know this is incredibly inconvenient, and I wish I had something sooner. [determined] Let me check for cancellations... [hopeful] Actually, if you're flexible, I can put you on our priority list with code PRI-8834 for any earlier openings.
241  [confidently] I'm assigning Tom Harrison, badge number TH-445, who's been with us twelve years. [reassuring tone] He specializes in weatherization issues and will bring a full diagnostic kit. [professionally] I'm also crediting your account $150 for the inconvenience—you'll see that as credit CR-20231127-B.
242  [firmly reassuring] Any installation errors are completely covered under your warranty, no questions asked. [helpful] Tom will document everything with photos and file report number INS-5521-TH if repairs are needed. [warmly] We stand behind our work one hundred percent, I promise you that.
243  [understanding] Absolutely, and that's exactly what you paid for and deserve. [organized tone] I have 555-0147 confirmed, and you'll receive a text reminder with Tom's photo ID the morning of. [sympathetically] Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this issue?
244  [efficiently] Of course, I'm sending that to janet.morrison@email.com right now—you should have it within five minutes. [thoroughly] It'll include case number CS-11247-DFT for your records. [helpfully] The email will also have Tom's direct line if you need to reschedule.
245  [seriously] I completely understand, and we value your referrals tremendously. [confidently] Tom will take care of everything on Thursday, I assure you. [warmly] We truly appreciate your patience with us during this frustrating situation, Ms. Morrison.
246  [professionally] Tom is always punctual, and he'll call thirty minutes before arrival as per protocol. [gratefully] Thank you for calling ClearView Windows, Ms. Morrison. [sincerely] We'll get those drafts fixed and your home comfortable again—you have my word on that.
247  [briskly] Good afternoon, I see you've got another appointment today—your fourth one this month. [apologetically] I know this has been, uh, frustrating, but I promise we'll get this sorted. [sighs] What seems to be happening with your service now?
248  [quickly] Right, I've got your service history pulled up here, and I can see the previous visits. [more calmly] The notes say they replaced your modem twice and, um, checked the lines. [determined] Today we're going to try a different approach entirely.
249  [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration—three visits with no resolution is unacceptable. [speaking faster] Look, I'm actually the senior tech they send when... when things get complicated. [confidently] I've seen this pattern before with the 7 PM timing.
250  [quickly] The 7 PM issue usually indicates interference from, uh, neighborhood equipment kicking on—could be someone's ham radio or industrial equipment. [more enthusiastically] Previous techs probably just ran basic diagnostics. [firmly] I brought specialized equipment to track electromagnetic interference today.
251  [reassuringly] We can file an FCC complaint if needed, but let's first confirm that's actually the issue. [speaking rapidly] I need to check your external connection box and run some tests during that 7 PM window. [pause] [more gently] Would you be okay if I stay until then?
252  [warmly] Coffee sounds great, and yes, I'm staying until we solve this. [chuckles] That's the difference between a fourth visit and, well, getting it right. [determined] Let me grab my spectrum analyzer from the truck.
253  [casually] Fifteen years, and trust me, I've seen everything from squirrels chewing cables to—to microwave ovens taking down entire blocks. [laughs softly] Your case isn't even the weirdest this week. [briskly] But it's definitely fixable.
254  [honestly] Every provider has issues, but this specific problem—we can fix it today. [speaking quickly] I'm already seeing some unusual readings on my equipment here. [intrigued] Has anyone new moved into the neighborhood recently, maybe three weeks ago?
255  [triumphantly] Bingo! That's exactly the timeframe you mentioned. [rapidly] Amateur radio operators sometimes use amplifiers that, uh, aren't properly shielded. [confidently] I can install filters that'll block their interference completely.
256  [efficiently] Installing them as we speak—should take about ten minutes. [reassuringly] And I'm documenting everything so if you ever have issues again, any tech will know exactly what happened. [chuckles] No more guessing games.
257  [Disappointed] Wait, wait, wait—you literally just told me five minutes ago that you were at home all night. [Slow] So how exactly did Marcus see you downtown?
258  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, that's, uh, that's really interesting because I have the receipts right here on my phone. [Chuckle] Should we look at them together?
259  [Whisper] You know what? I'm gonna pretend I didn't just hear that because—[Fast] actually no, I can't, that's the third different story you've told me today.
260  [Angry] Are you seriously gonna stand there and—[Shout] I WAS THERE! I saw you with my own eyes!
261  [Happy] This is actually kinda hilarious because, um, Sarah already told me everything. [Laugh] Did you really think she wouldn't?
262  [Sad] I just... I don't understand why you'd even need to lie about something so small, you know? [Sigh] It's like, what else aren't you telling me?
263  [Fast] Okay so let me get this straight—first it was Tuesday, then it was Thursday, and now suddenly it never happened at all? [Tsk]
264  [Slow] That's funny because, uh, your location was on the whole time and I can literally see where you were. [Disappointed] Wanna try again?
265  [Sarcastic] Right, right, your phone just mysteriously died at the exact moment you were supposed to be there. [Slow] How convenient is that?
266  [Whisper] Stop. Just... stop talking, okay? [Sad] Every word you're saying is making this worse and we both know it.
267  [Angry] I'm not stupid—I mean, do you honestly think I'm that gullible? [Fast] The timestamps don't even match up!
268  [Chuckle] You're, like, the worst liar I've ever met in my entire life. [Happy] Seriously, your eye is literally twitching right now!
269  [Disappointed] So basically what you're telling me is that everyone else is lying except you? [Sarcastic] Yeah, that seems super likely.
270  [Shout] Don't you dare—[Angry] DON'T YOU DARE try to flip this around on me when I have proof!
271  [Slow] Um, you do realize that you posted about it on Instagram, right? [Tsk] Like, it's still there if you wanna check.
272  [matter-of-fact] So I had to have a conversation with my sister today about the whole wedding planning thing. You know how she's been calling me like every other day asking me to help with all these details? [conversational] I finally just told her I needed some space from it. Like, I want to be supportive, but I have my own stuff going on, you know? I was pretty calm about it, just explained that I needed to step back a little. [slightly uncomfortable] Actually, let me think about what I said exactly... [pause] I said, um, "I can't be your unpaid wedding coordinator anymore. You need to figure this out yourself or hire someone." [realizing] Wait, did I really say "unpaid wedding coordinator"? [nervous laugh] That sounds... that sounds kind of harsh now that I'm saying it out loud. [growing concern] And then I said— oh god, I told her she was being "emotionally draining" and that I felt like she only called me when she needed something. [groan] Why did I say it like that? [increasingly anxious] I mean, it's true, but... [sharp exhale] she's planning her wedding! Of course she's stressed! And I just— I basically told my sister she was using me right before the biggest day of her life. [spiraling] [upset] What if I ruined everything? What if she doesn't want me in the wedding anymore? [whimper] Oh my god, I'm the worst sister ever. I should call her back, shouldn't I?
273  [Fast] Hold up, hold up—you couldn't have been stuck in traffic because they closed that road like three weeks ago for construction. [Disappointed] Nice try though.
274  [Happy] Oh my god, your face right now is just—[Laugh] [Laugh] You totally forgot about the security cameras, didn't you?
275  [Whisper] You know what's really messed up? [Slow] I actually would've understood if you'd just told me the truth from the beginning.
276  [Sarcastic] Mmm-hmm, and I suppose your identical twin was the one using your credit card at that exact location? [Groan] Just admit it already.
277  [excited] Oh my God, you have no idea how perfect my timing was today! I've been stalking that leather jacket on the Madewell website for like— for weeks now, just waiting for it to go on sale, and today I finally just said screw it, I'm getting it. [enthusiastic] Like I had the whole thing planned out, I was gonna wear it this weekend to Sarah's party, and then obviously like every day after that because it's literally perfect. I've been thinking about this jacket for so long, it's like— it's basically already mine, you know? [deflated] So I go to check out and... sold out. Completely sold out in my size. Just, boom, gone. I'm sitting there staring at my laptop like an idiot, and I'm just like— [groan] of course. Of course this happens to me. [frustrated] I was so annoyed, I was like why did I wait so long? I should've just bought it full price when I first saw it, but no, I had to be all responsible and— and budget-conscious or whatever. [surprised] [curious] Wait, hold on. It's saying there's still— there's one left but it's in this burnt orange color instead of the black one I wanted. Let me just... [delighted] [amazed] Oh wow. Oh this is actually— this is so much better! The orange is gorgeous, it's like perfect for fall, and it'll go with those boots I just got. God, sometimes things just work out exactly how they're supposed to, don't they?
278  Oh—oh god, okay. Um, what about them? I mean, I know I've been kinda weird lately but I didn't think—wait, are you mad at me?
279  I wasn't being passive—okay no, that's not true. I was. I totally was and I'm sorry, I just—I've been in such a weird headspace lately, y'know? That's not an excuse though.
280  [Groan] God, hearing it back like that... yeah, that sounds terrible. I didn't—I wasn't trying to be mean, I swear. I was just feeling left out and instead of saying that like a normal person I got all... petty.
281  I know, I know! I should've just—I wanted to, honestly. But then I'd start typing and I'd delete it because what if I sounded needy or like, clingy? So instead I just... acted like a jerk apparently. [nervous laugh]
282  Oh no, I—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. The last thing I ever wanna do is hurt you. You're literally one of my favorite people and I just—I really messed this up, didn't I?
283  [muttering] Okay, so, um, two minutes. Two minutes for leftover pizza. That's— that's not that long, right? I mean, I could, uh, I could probably wait two minutes without, like, completely losing my mind here. [slightly impatient] But I'm so hungry though. Like, really hungry. When did I even eat last? Was it— was it breakfast? Did I have breakfast? [sigh] I feel like I had coffee, but that's not— that's not really food, is it. [drawn out, watching microwave] One minute fifty. Okay. Um, okay, so maybe I should've just eaten it cold? Cold pizza's not that bad, right? People do that. College students do that all the time, so— [faster, second-guessing] No, no, warm pizza is definitely better. Melted cheese and all that. I made the right choice here. I'm just, uh, I'm just being dramatic because I'm hungry and when you're hungry everything takes forever and— [fidgety] One minute twenty. [groan] This is like watching paint dry. Actually, paint probably dries faster than this. Do I have anything else I could— I could grab some crackers or something while I wait? That's not, um, that's not cheating, right? [resigned but lighter] You know what, one minute left. I can do one minute. I'm an adult, I can wait sixty seconds for properly heated food. This is fine.
284  Yeah no, I see that now. I totally see that. I was being paranoid and reading into everything and—god, those texts were so passive aggressive. I hate that I did that. I hate being that person, y'know?
285  Wait wait wait, please don't—I mean, I get it, but please don't stop talking to me. [Sigh] I promise I'll work on it. Like actually work on it, not just say I will.
286  Because I'm gonna—okay, from now on, if I'm feeling weird about something, I'm just gonna tell you straight up. No more hints or whatever that passive aggressive crap was. Just... honest communication. I can do that.
287  Really? You're not—you're not still mad? Because I would totally understand if you were. I mean, I'm still kinda mad at myself honestly, so...
288  I mean—yeah, because it's literally the same situation. You're doing the exact same thing you did back then, and I'm just trying to—[sigh] I'm trying to help you see the pattern here.
289  Okay okay, but time doesn't make it irrelevant? Like, you're about to make the same mistake with Alex that you made with Jamie, and I'm supposed to just... not say anything?
290  It's—come on, it's basically identical. You get all intense, you ignore the red flags, then boom—you're devastated when it falls apart. I'm not trying to be mean here, I just... I dunno, I thought that's what friends do.
291  That's not—[frustrated laugh] wow, okay. So now I'm throwing things in your face? I'm literally just pointing out that maybe, y'know, we could learn from what happened before.
292  Because you keep—ugh, fine. You keep repeating the same stuff! And then when I bring it up, suddenly I'm the bad guy who can't let things go? That's kinda unfair, don't you think?
293  Oh, so now I'm keeping score? Look look, I get that you're upset, but I'm not like, sitting here with a list of your failures. It just—it comes up because it's relevant, y'know?
294  Um, yeah? Yeah it is. When you're literally about to text Alex the same desperate paragraph you sent Jamie at 2am? [scoff] I mean, how is that NOT relevant?
295  I didn't—no, I just remember because I was there, holding your phone, telling you not to send it. And you did anyway. And then we spent like three weeks dealing with the fallout, so yeah, I remember.
296  That's—seriously? I never said I was perfect. I've made plenty of mistakes, but at least when you point them out, I actually listen instead of getting all... whatever this is.
297  And this is me being tired of watching you crash into the same wall over and over. But fine fine, next time I'll just—[groan] I'll just shut up and let you figure it out yourself. Again.
298  Wait wait wait—the lead? Like, the actual lead lead? Oh my god, I knew you were auditioning but I didn't—this is huge! When did you find out?
299  And you're just now telling me? I'm—okay, I'm actually kinda offended but also like, totally proud of you right now. What's the play? Is it the Shakespeare one you mentioned?
300  You're playing Hamlet? That's—that's literally iconic. I mean, do you even realize how big this is? [Gasp] Wait, when do rehearsals start?
301  Six weeks? That's like—okay that's actually really soon. How are you feeling about it? Because you seem weirdly calm for someone who just landed, y'know, the role of a lifetime.
302  Nervous is—honestly? Nervous is totally normal. I'd be freaking out. Actually, no, I'd probably have thrown up by now [Laugh]. Have you told your parents yet?
303  What? No no no, you have to—I mean, they're gonna find out anyway, right? Unless you're planning to, like, perform in secret or something.
304  Okay, yeah, fair point. Your mom would probably invite the entire neighborhood and make those embarrassing signs. But still, this is—you worked really hard for this, y'know?
305  Stop. Just—stop right there. You're not gonna be terrible. You literally made me cry reading that monologue in your living room, remember? And that was just, like, practice.
306  Critics are just—okay, they're basically professional haters anyway [Chuckle]. But seriously, you've got this natural thing when you perform. It's like you become someone else entirely, it's actually kinda scary how good you are.
307  But you did. And that's—I mean, that's the whole point, right? You showed up, you were brave, and now you're gonna be amazing. I'm definitely getting front row tickets, by the way. Like, try and stop me.
308  Oh god, okay—I've been thinking about this all night. I know I—I know I messed up when you were trying to tell me about work and I just... I didn't handle it right.
309  I wasn't—I wasn't laughing AT you, I swear! It was just nervous, you know? Like when you said your boss was being passive aggressive, I thought you were making a joke and—wait wait, that's not an excuse. I'm not trying to make excuses.
310  No no no, that's not—[groan] I'm making this worse. Your problems aren't funny, they're not. I just... sometimes I don't know how to respond to serious stuff and I kinda default to trying to lighten the mood? Which is stupid, I know it's stupid.
311  I didn't mean it like—okay, I hear how that sounded now. Really dismissive. Like, really really dismissive. I think I was trying to relate? But instead I just... basically invalidated everything you were going through. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot.
312  I know. I—I've been thinking about that too, actually. Remember when you told me about your anxiety stuff and I said everyone gets nervous sometimes? That was—that was so shitty of me. I've been wanting to apologize for that for literally months but I didn't know how to bring it up.
313  Yeah. Yeah, I did. I think I'm just—I'm really bad at sitting with heavy stuff, y'know? Like my brain goes "quick, make it lighter, make it better" but that's not... that's not what you need from me. [sigh] That's not what being a good friend looks like.
314  I know. And I should've—I should've just shut up and listened. You were literally having such a hard time and instead of being there for you, I made it about... I dunno, my own discomfort with serious conversations? That's messed up.
315  I'm gonna—I wanna do better. Like, genuinely. I know I can't just say that and make it okay, but... maybe you could call me out? When I do it? Because honestly sometimes I don't even realize until way later and then I'm like lying in bed at 3am going "oh shit, I did it again."
316  No, you're right. You're totally right. That's—that's on me to figure out. I just meant... um, I mean... [nervous laugh] okay, I'm gonna work on it. By myself. And maybe, like, actually think before I speak for once?
317  Yeah, it would. But hey, I'm—I'm really sorry. Like truly, deeply sorry. You deserve a friend who takes your problems seriously, and I haven't been that person. But I want to be. If you'll... if you'll still let me try.
318  [muttering] Come on, come on... how long has this been red? I swear I've been standing here for, like, um, for like five minutes already. Which is probably not true, but it, uh, it feels like five minutes. [slightly impatient] Okay, so there's no cars coming from that direction, and there's no cars coming from— I mean, there's literally nobody here. Why can't I just— but no, no, that's how you get hit by a car, right? The one car you don't see. [resigned] Plus there's probably, um, there's probably a camera or something watching, and I'll be that person who, uh, who jaywalks and then immediately gets a ticket. [sigh] That would be so typical. [brightening slightly] Oh wait, is that— no, still red. I thought I saw it, um, I thought I saw it flicker or something, but... [hmm] maybe it's broken? Do traffic lights break? I mean, they must, right? [casual acceptance] Whatever, I'm not in a rush anyway. I've got, like, nowhere important to be. Just gonna stand here and, uh, and wait like a responsible adult. [exhale] Look at me being all patient and stuff.
319  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I need something to listen to while I— while I do the dishes. But what do I, uh— what do I actually want to hear right now? [sigh] I've got like fifty things in my queue and I can never, um, I can never decide. [slightly overwhelmed] There's that true crime one, but it's, uh, it's kind of heavy for a Tuesday morning, you know? And then there's the, um— the comedy one, but I'm like three episodes behind and I feel like I'm gonna be lost if I just jump in. [tsk] Why do I do this to myself? [brightening slightly] Oh, wait, what about that new one? The, uh, the food one that Sarah recommended? But is it— is it actually good or is it just, like, trendy right now? [hmm] I hate when I pick something and then it's boring and I'm stuck with, um, with dishes and boredom. [resigned but decisive] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna hit shuffle on the comedy ones. Even if I'm behind, it's not like, uh, it's not like there's some complex plot I'm missing. [laugh] Problem solved. Sort of.
320  [muttering] Okay, so, um— did I lock the door? I feel like I locked it, but, uh, but now I'm not— I'm not totally sure. I always lock it, right? Like, that's just, um, that's just what I do. [slightly uncertain] But I was, uh, I was rushing this morning because of the, um, the thing with my coffee maker, and I had to— I had to use the French press instead, which took forever, and then I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna be— [faster, working through it] Wait wait wait. Let me just— let me think about this. I grabbed my keys, I walked to the door, I opened it, stepped out, and then I— did I turn around? I feel like I turned around, but maybe I was just, uh, maybe I was just thinking about turning around? [frustrated sigh] [more animated] This is— this is so annoying. Like, why can't I just remember doing something I literally do every single day? It's muscle memory, it should be— [tsk] I mean, it's not like it's complicated. [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna assume I did it. Because I always do it, and, um, and statistically speaking, I probably— yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Probably.
321  [muttering] Okay, so, um— should I just send it? I mean, it's not that bad, right? It's just, uh, it's just a little joke about what happened at lunch, and like— like, maybe they'll think it's funny? Or maybe they'll think I'm, um, I'm totally weird for bringing it up again. [slightly nervous] But I mean, we were laughing about it, so that's— that's a good sign, right? Right? [sigh] God, why is this so— why do I always overthink these things? It's literally just a text. People send texts all the time. [faster] Okay, but what if they don't respond? What if they think I'm being too, um, too forward or something? Because we don't really text that much, and this is kind of— it's kind of random, isn't it? [hesitant] Unless... unless it's not that random? I mean, they did give me their number, so they probably— they probably want me to use it, right? [hmm] That's how numbers work. [decisive, then wavering] You know what? I'm just gonna— I'm gonna send it. Life's too short to, uh, to worry about every little— [pause] or maybe I should wait until tomorrow? [resigned] Ugh, okay, no. Sending it now before I, um, before I chicken out completely.
322  [muttering] Oh, come on. Five percent? Really? I just— I just checked this like an hour ago and it was at, um, it was at like thirty something. How does it just— [sigh] how does it just disappear like that? [slightly panicked] Okay, so, um, charger. Where's my— where's my charger? It's not in my bag, it's not— did I leave it at work? Oh god, please don't tell me I left it at work because that means I'm gonna be, like, completely cut off for the rest of the— [thinking out loud] Wait, okay, let me just— let me just think about this logically. I could, um, I could ask someone? But that's so awkward, like, "hey, can I borrow your charger" and then I'm just, uh, I'm just tethered to their wall for like an hour. [resigned] Or I could just— I could just let it die. I mean, people survived without phones for, like, thousands of years, right? It's not gonna kill me to be unreachable for a few hours. Probably. [second-guessing] But what if someone needs to— what if there's an emergency or something important and I just— [groan] why didn't I charge it last night?
323  [muttering] Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, five minutes? Ten? I plugged it in and then I— I don't know, I got distracted by, uh, by whatever. [sigh] Come on, phone. Just— just give me something here. [slightly impatient] I mean, it was completely dead, so that's— that's on me, I guess. But like, shouldn't there be enough juice by now to at least, um, to at least turn on? Even for like two seconds? [tsk] I just need to check if— if Sarah texted me back about tonight. [hopeful] Let me just— let me try pressing the button again. Maybe it'll— [pause] nope. Still nothing. Just that stupid black screen judging me for my, uh, for my poor charging habits. Which, okay, fair enough. [resigned but chatty] I should probably just, um, just leave it alone for like ten more minutes, right? That's what normal people would do. Patient people. But I'm not— I'm clearly not patient people because here I am talking to a dead phone like it's gonna, uh, like it's gonna suddenly care about my schedule. [trailing off] Maybe I should find a book or something. Do I even— do I even remember how to just... sit? Without scrolling? [laugh] This is gonna be interesting.
324  [muttering] Oh, you've got to be— you've got to be kidding me. The, um, the speaker I bought yesterday is literally— it's literally forty percent off today. Forty percent! [sigh] I mean, what are the, uh, what are the odds? [slightly incredulous] I was so proud of myself too, like, "Oh good job, you actually, um, you actually did the research this time." Looked at reviews, compared prices, the whole— the whole thing. And now it's, uh— [groan] now it's basically half price. [faster, working through it] Okay, so, um, so what can I do here? I could return it, right? But then I'd have to, uh, I'd have to drive all the way back, wait in that line again, and then— and then rebuy the exact same thing? That seems, um, that seems kind of ridiculous. [contemplative] I mean, it's not like I— it's not like I can't afford it. It's just the principle, you know? Like, why does this always— why does this always happen to me? [tsk] It's like the universe has, um, has terrible timing. [resigned, trailing off] Whatever. I guess that's just... that's just how it goes. The speaker works fine, I like it, so, um... I'll just pretend I never saw the sale. Right. Easy enough.
325  [muttering] Okay, so, um, serving size is— let me just— [sigh] why is this so tiny? Like, servings per container... two and a half? Two and a half servings in this little, uh, this little bag of chips that I could literally finish in like five minutes. [slightly exasperated] So wait, if there's, um, if there's 150 calories per serving, and there's two and a half servings, then that's— that's what, like 375 calories total? For this tiny— [huh] that seems like a lot for something this small. [slower, working it out] But okay, so if I eat, like, half the bag, that would be... one and a quarter servings? So that's, um, 150 times— no wait, that's not— [tsk] why can't I just do math in my head anymore? [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna eat some chips and not think about it too hard. Like, it's not that serious, right? It's just— it's just a snack. [trailing off] Although I guess I should probably... I mean, if I'm trying to—
326  [carefully measured] Okay, so, um, don't touch anything. Don't touch anything for, like, what did she say— ten minutes? Fifteen? I should've, uh, I should've asked how long exactly, but— [slightly annoyed] [sigh] Why do I always do this? Like, I always paint my nails right before I need to, um, need to do stuff. It's like my brain just— just doesn't plan ahead or something. [muttering] Okay, so what can I do that doesn't involve my, uh, my hands? I mean, I could watch TV, but the remote is— the remote's over there and I'd have to, like, carefully grab it with my, um, with my knuckles or whatever. [thoughtful] Maybe I should just, like, sit here and meditate or something. Be zen about it. Just, uh, just embrace the stillness. [snort] Yeah right, like I'm gonna meditate. [resigned] I could call my mom, but then I'd have to hold the phone and— wait, no, speaker phone. [huh] Actually that's not a terrible idea. [trailing off] Or I could just, um, just sit here and think about stuff for once. When do I ever just... sit and think about—
327  [muttering] Come on, come on, just— just load already. I mean, it's not like I'm asking for, um, for something crazy here, it's just— [sigh] it's just a basic webpage, right? [slightly impatient] Okay, so the little spinny thing is, uh, it's still spinning, which means it's trying, I guess? But like, how long does it— how long does it actually take to load one page? This wifi is supposed to be, um, it's supposed to be decent. [drawn out] Maybe I should, uh— maybe I should refresh? No wait, that's— that's probably gonna make it worse, right? Like, starting over from scratch when it's already, um, it's already trying to— [brightening slightly] Oh! Okay, something's happening. I can see, uh, I can see the header loading. That's progress. That's, um— [exhale] okay, we're getting somewhere. [deadpan] Aaaaand it's frozen again. Cool. This is, uh, this is exactly how I wanted to spend my lunch break. Just staring at a, um, at a half-loaded website like it's gonna magically— [resigned] You know what? I'll just— I'll just wait. What else am I gonna do, right? [tsk] Maybe I should get better internet.
328  [muttering] Okay, so I need to, um, I need to tape this box up, but where's the— where's the end of this tape? There's gotta be an end somewhere, right? Like, it doesn't just, um, it doesn't just go on forever. [slightly annoyed] I mean, I literally just used this yesterday and I— I thought I left a little tab or whatever, but now it's just, uh, it's just this smooth cylinder of, of tape. [tsk] Which is, um, which is great for my fingernails. [focused] Okay, let me just— if I run my finger around the edge here, maybe I can, uh— [hmm] nope. Nothing. Wait, wait, maybe if I use my nail and just, like, scrape along the— ow, okay, that's not— that's not gonna work. [brightening] Oh! What if I, um, what if I use the scissors? Just drag the point along until it catches on something? That's gotta— that's gotta work, right? [relieved] There we go! Got it. [exhale] Finally. I swear they make this stuff impossible to, uh, to find on purpose. Like some kind of, um, some kind of tape conspiracy or whatever. [laugh]
329  [muttering] Okay, so I need, um, I need milk and bread and— oh, and those, uh, those crackers. So that's like three things. Do I need a cart for three things? That seems, um, that seems like overkill. [uncertain] But I mean, milk is heavy, right? And I always— I always end up getting more stuff than I, uh, than I planned. Like, I'll see something and be like "oh yeah, I need that too" and then I'm, um, I'm juggling everything. [slightly frustrated] Ugh, but the carts are all the way over there and I'm already— I'm already here by the baskets. And it's not like I'm doing a big shop, it's just a quick, um, a quick in-and-out thing. [second-guessing] Although... [sigh] although last time I did this, I ended up with like six things and my arms were all— they were all cramped up by the time I got to checkout. That sucked. [resigned] You know what? Fine. Cart. I'll get the stupid cart. Better safe than, um, than sorry, right? Even if I look ridiculous pushing this giant thing around for three items. [exhale] Whatever.
330  [muttering] Oh, come on. Come on. Of course it's— of course it's raining now. I mean, I checked the weather this morning, I literally, um, I literally looked at my phone and it said like, uh, like thirty percent chance or whatever. [slightly exasperated] Thirty percent! That's— that's basically nothing, right? That's like, oh, maybe a light drizzle, maybe some, um, some clouds. Not this— [sigh] not this actual rain that's, uh, that's definitely gonna soak through my jacket. [thinking out loud] Okay, so, um, where did I— did I bring it? My umbrella? I feel like I grabbed it from the, uh, from the stand by the door, but then I— wait, no. No no no, I remember now. I put it back because it looked, um, it looked fine outside. [resigned, with a slight laugh] Right. Okay. So my options are, uh, let's see... I can just— I can just run for it, or I can, um, I can stand under this awning like some kind of, uh, some kind of sad, umbrella-less person until it— until it stops. [deadpan] Which, knowing my luck, will be, um, will be never. [exhale] Great. This is, uh, this is just perfect.
331  [muttering] Okay, so I was just, um— I was making all these really good points about the quarterly reports and, uh, and everyone's just sitting there staring at me like— like I'm crazy or something. Which is, um, which is weird because I thought I was being pretty, you know, pretty articulate for once. [realization dawning] Wait. Wait wait wait. [exhale] Oh no. The little, uh, the little microphone icon— is that— that's got a line through it, doesn't it. [groan] That's the mute thing. That means I'm— oh god, I'm muted, aren't I. [slightly panicked] How long have I been— I mean, I was talking for like, what, three minutes? Four minutes? About the budget allocation and the, um, the staffing issues, and they're all just— they probably think I'm just moving my mouth like some kind of, uh, like some kind of broken puppet or something. [embarrassed but trying to laugh it off] Okay, so now I have to, um, I have to unmute and just pretend like— like that didn't happen. Or do I acknowledge it? Do people acknowledge the mute thing? [sigh] This is why I hate technology. [resigned] Right. Okay. Just gonna, um, just gonna click this little button here and— and maybe make a little joke about it. Everyone does this, right? This is, uh, this is totally normal. [nervous laugh] Totally fine.
332  [muttering] Okay, so, um, three fifty. Three fifty degrees. [sigh] How long does this thing even— I mean, it says it's preheating, but like, what does that actually mean? Five minutes? Ten minutes? I should, uh, I should probably know this by now. [slightly impatient] I just— I just want to make some, um, some frozen pizza, you know? It's not— it's not rocket science. But here I am, just, uh, just standing here like an idiot waiting for this little light to— to do whatever it's supposed to do. [thoughtful] Maybe I should, um, maybe I should use this time productively? Like, I could— I could prep the, uh, the toppings or something. But it's frozen pizza, so there's not really— there's not really much to prep, is there? [drawn out] God, I can hear it like, clicking and whooshing in there. Is that normal? I think that's normal. My old oven didn't— or wait, did it? I don't— [hmm] I don't really remember paying attention. [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna, um, I'm just gonna trust the process here. It'll beep when it's ready. Probably. Right? [laugh] Famous last words.
333  [muttering] Oh, come on. Come on, really? The, uh— the little light's on. Of course it is. Of course the gas light decides to, um, to come on right now when I'm already running late and— [slightly exasperated] Okay, so, um, how far can I actually go on empty? Like, I feel like I've heard different things about this. Some people say you can go, like, fifty miles? But that seems— that seems optimistic. Maybe that's just, uh, just wishful thinking. [calculating] Let me think, um, when did I last get gas? Was it Tuesday? Wednesday? [tsk] I should really pay more attention to this stuff. I mean, it's not like the gas tank is, uh, is a mystery. It's right there on the dashboard. [resigned but practical] Okay, so there's that Shell station on Fifth Street, and then there's the, um, the cheaper place by the grocery store, but that's kind of out of the way and if I'm really running on fumes here— [decisive] Right. Shell it is. I'll just, uh, I'll just deal with paying an extra ten cents per gallon. That's— that's the price of poor planning, I guess.
334  [muttering] Okay, so, um, what was it? It's gotta be— it's gotta be something simple, right? Like, I use this thing every day, I should— I should know this. [sigh] Come on, brain. [slightly more focused] Alright, let me just— let me think about this logically. It's probably, um, it's probably the usual one with the, uh, the capital letter and the numbers at the end? Or wait, no, didn't I change it last month when they made us— when they made us update everything? [frustrated] Ugh, okay, so maybe it's the, um, the dog's name thing? With the— with the birthday year? But which birthday, mine or— or the dog's? [laugh] That sounds insane. Who uses their dog's birthday for a password? [tentative] Wait wait wait, what about— what about that thing where I used, um, where I used Mom's maiden name but spelled it wrong on purpose? Like, deliberately wrong so it's more— more secure or whatever? [deflated] Or I could just, uh, I could just click "forgot password" like a normal person instead of, um, instead of sitting here talking to myself about my dog's birthday. [sigh] Yeah. Let's— let's do that.
335  [muttering] Okay, so, um, what day is it today? I feel like I should know this. I should— I should definitely know what day of the week it is, right? [sigh] This is, uh, this is kind of embarrassing. [slightly confused] Let me think. Yesterday was, um— yesterday was... [hmm] okay, I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I always go on, like, Sundays usually. So if yesterday was Sunday, then today would be— wait, no, that's not— that's not right. [faster, working it out] Actually, hold on. The grocery store was super crowded, which means it was probably a weekend day, but I also had to, um, I had to do laundry, and I never do laundry on Sundays because that's when everyone else— [tsk] ugh, this is not helping. [more focused] Okay okay okay, let me just— what did I do this morning? I had my usual coffee, nothing special planned, no alarms went off screaming at me, so it's probably not a Monday. That's something, right? [slightly defeated] You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm just gonna check my phone like a normal person. [laugh] Why am I making this so complicated? It's probably, like, Wednesday or something perfectly normal.
336  [muttering] Okay, so, um, restart and— and now we wait. How long does this usually take? Like, it feels like it used to be faster, but maybe that's just, uh, maybe that's just me being impatient. [slightly annoyed] I mean, I literally just wanted to, um, to open one document and now I have to sit here and— [sigh] and watch this little spinning thing. Which is, uh, which is not even spinning anymore, it's just— it's just stuck there. [uncertain] Should it be taking this long? I feel like something's wrong, but also, like, computers are weird, right? Sometimes they just, um, they just take their sweet time for no— no apparent reason. [fidgety] Okay, maybe I should've, uh, maybe I should've saved that thing I was working on first. Did I save it? I think I saved it. [worried] No wait, did I— did I actually hit save or did I just think about hitting save? [resigned] Whatever. It's— it's probably fine. It's 2024, things auto-save now, right? [exhale] Right. Just gonna, um, just gonna sit here and trust the process.
337  [muttering under breath] Oh no, oh no, okay, um— who is that? I know them, I definitely, uh, I definitely know them. They're walking over here and I— [sigh] I cannot remember their name for the life of me. [slightly panicked] Okay, think, think. Where do I know them from? Work? No, that's not— wait, maybe work? They look familiar but not, um, not work familiar. More like, uh, like neighbor familiar? Or maybe the gym? [faster, more frantic] Sarah? No, that's not right. Sandra? Stephanie? Wait wait wait, does it start with an S? I feel like it starts with an S but that might just be, um, that might just be because I said Sarah first and now I'm, uh, I'm stuck on S names. [desperately hopeful] Maybe they'll say my name first and then I can just be like "hey you!" in that, um, in that casual way where you don't actually have to say their name back. That works, right? That's, uh, that's totally normal. [resigned] Or I could just, you know, be honest and— nope, too late, they're here. [nervous laugh] Here we go.
338  [muttering] Okay, so I need the, um— where did they put the cereal? I swear it used to be, like, right here on the— on the middle shelf, but now it's just... [sigh] of course. Of course it's not there. [slightly annoyed] Let me just— let me look around here. Maybe they moved it to, um, to a different... [tsk] nope. Not there either. This is, uh, this is why I hate when they reorganize the whole— the whole grocery store layout. [resigned] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [drawn out] Up there. It's up there, isn't it? On the very top shelf. Because why would it be, um, why would it be anywhere a normal person could reach it? [determined but wary] Okay, so I just need to— I mean, how hard can it be? I'll just, uh, I'll stretch up and... [grunt] nope. Nope, that's not— that's not happening. My arms are apparently too short for, um, for modern grocery shopping. [contemplative] Do I ask someone? I could ask that guy over there, but he looks busy and I don't want to— [hmm] or maybe there's like a step stool or something? Do stores have those? [accepting] You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm gonna grab a different cereal. The universe is clearly telling me to try something new today. [laugh] Or maybe it's telling me to grow taller, but that ship has, uh, that ship has sailed.
339  [muttering] Okay, so I came in here for— for something. What was I, um, what was I gonna do? I definitely had a reason, like, a specific reason for coming in here. [slightly puzzled] Was it, uh— was it something to do with the, um, the laundry? No, that's not— that doesn't feel right. I mean, I was just in the kitchen, so maybe it was, like, maybe I needed something from in here for cooking? But what would I— [drawn out, thinking] Hmm. Let me just, um, let me just retrace my steps here. I was making lunch, and then I thought, oh, I should go get— [pause] get what? What did I need to get? [slightly frustrated] This is so— this is so annoying. It was literally, like, thirty seconds ago. How do you just forget in thirty seconds? My brain is just, uh, it's just completely— [brighter, remembering] Oh! [laugh] The napkins. I came to get napkins from the, um, from the drawer. Right, okay, that makes sense. See? I'm not losing it, I just, uh— I just needed a minute.
340  [muttering] Oh. Oh no. Um, okay, so— so that's, uh, that's not right. One black sock, one... navy? Is that navy? I mean, they're both dark, but they're— they're definitely not the same. [slightly exasperated] How did I— how did I not notice this when I was, um, when I was getting dressed? I literally put them on, like, one at a time, and I just— [sigh] I just didn't look, I guess. [considering] Okay, but like, realistically, who's gonna notice? I mean, my shoes cover most of— most of them anyway, and it's not like I'm, uh, I'm giving a presentation or anything. Right? [uncertain] But what if— what if I have to take my shoes off? Like at, um, at Sarah's place, she always makes people— oh god, what if there's yoga? There's not gonna be yoga, is there? [resigned, slightly amused] You know what, I'm just— I'm just gonna own it. Mismatched socks. That's, uh, that's my whole vibe now, I guess. Very... artsy. Very intentional. [snort] Sure.
341  [uncertain] Oh. Oh wait, is that— are they waving at me? I think— I think they're waving. But, um, but they could be waving at, like, literally anyone behind me, right? [nervous laugh] There's probably, uh, there's probably someone right behind me. [muttering quickly] Okay, so do I wave back? Because if I wave and they're not— if they're not actually waving at me, then I'm just, um, I'm just some weirdo waving at nothing. Which is— which is not great. [slightly panicked] But if they ARE waving at me and I don't wave back, then I'm, uh, I'm rude. I'm the rude person who ignores people. [exhale] God, why is this— why is this so complicated? [thinking out loud] I mean, I could do like a half-wave? Like a, um, like a little tentative wave that could maybe pass as just, uh, just adjusting my hair or something if it goes wrong? [resigned] Okay, okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna do it. Quick little wave. [pause] There. Done. And they're... yeah, they're waving back. So we're good. We're, um, we're all good here.
342  [casual] So I was, um, I was at the climbing gym today, and this new guy shows up, right? And he's like, uh, he's asking about bouldering, and I'm like, "Oh yeah, it's super easy, you just— you just start with the, um, the green routes, they're like beginner level." You know? I mean, I've been doing this for, uh, for like six months now, so— [matter-of-fact] And I'm like, "Yeah, just, um, just grab the holds and pull yourself up, it's— it's not rocket science." [light laugh] So he goes over to try one, and I'm, uh, I'm watching him, and he's just— he's really struggling, you know? Like, uh, like really struggling with this, um, this basic green route. [a bit uncomfortable] And I'm standing there like, "Oh, uh, maybe try— try using your legs more?" But he's getting frustrated, and I can see him, like, uh, looking around to see if people are watching him fail, and— and I realize I'm just— [uncomfortable laugh] I'm just making it worse. [growing concern] Because I kept saying "easy" and "basic" and, um, and "just do this" and— oh god, I made him feel like an idiot, didn't I? Like, uh, like I was talking to him like he was— [groan] like he was five years old or something. [spiraling with guilt] And now I'm thinking about every single thing I said, and it's all— it's all so condescending! "It's not rocket science"? Who says that? I sound like, um, like such a— [frustrated sigh] like such a pretentious asshole! He probably thinks I'm this, uh, this know-it-all jerk who was just— just showing off! [mortified] Oh my god, I think I saw him leave early because of me! I was trying to be helpful, but I just— I just made this poor guy feel stupid for, um, for being new at something! [groan] I'm never— I'm never giving unsolicited advice again, I'm— ugh, I'm the worst!
343  [casual] [light] Oh my god, so you know how I've been putting off calling the dentist? [chuckle] It's been like— what, six months now? Maybe eight? But like, my teeth feel fine, you know? I'm not in pain or anything, so I keep thinking I'll just call tomorrow, and then tomorrow becomes next week... [conversational] I mean, I brush, I floss most of the time, I'm not a complete disaster. And honestly? Those cleanings are so awkward with all the— the scraping and the "when was your last cleaning" judgment. [dry laugh] Plus they always find something wrong just to justify the visit, right? [trailing off] [a bit concerned] But actually, speaking of teeth, I've been getting this weird... [pause] I don't know, like a sharp feeling when I drink cold stuff? Just on one side. It's probably nothing though, just sensitive teeth or— [stopping] [realization dawning] Wait. [tongue clicking] There's like... oh. Oh no. I can feel something with my tongue right now. Like a rough spot on my molar? How did I not notice this before? [growing anxiety] Oh god, what if it's a cavity? What if it's been getting worse this whole time while I've been putting off the appointment? [nervous laugh] What if I need a root canal? [spiraling] [panicked] Eight months! I haven't been to the dentist in eight months and there's definitely something wrong and now it's probably— [whimper] oh my god, what if my tooth falls out? What if I need surgery? I'm the worst patient ever, they're going to lecture me and—
344  [frustrated] Dude, I am so— I'm so pissed right now. I lost my wallet somewhere and I've been like, tearing my apartment apart for the past hour looking for this thing. [angry] I had it this morning, I know I had it because I bought coffee on my way to work, and then I get home and it's just— [groan] it's gone. Vanished. Like where does a wallet even go? It's not like it can walk away. [increasingly agitated] I already called the coffee place, I called my work, I retraced my steps like three times. Nothing. And now I have to cancel all my cards and get a new license and it's just— ugh, it's gonna be such a pain in the ass. [still frustrated] I'm gonna have to call the bank tomorrow and sit on hold for like an hour, and then wait two weeks for new cards, and I have that dinner thing on Friday that I'll have to— [surprised] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. I'm— hold on, let me just... [sheepish] [relieved] Oh my God. [nervous laugh] It's in my other jacket. The one I wore yesterday. I just— I felt something in the pocket and... yep. There it is. [embarrassed] [laughing] I'm an idiot. I literally spent an hour having a complete meltdown over nothing. [chuckle] Don't ever let me live this down, okay?
345  [frustrated] Oh my god, so I wake up this morning, right? And I go to make coffee and the stupid machine just— it won't even turn on. Like nothing. Not even a little light or anything. [annoyed] And of course this happens on a Monday when I have that early meeting, so I'm just standing there like an idiot pressing buttons, and I'm like, I don't have time for this. I don't have time to deal with broken appliances right now. [exasperated] So I'm gonna have to go to work with no caffeine, which you know how I get, and I'm already calculating like okay, how much is this gonna cost me to replace, when am I gonna have time to go shopping for a new one... [sigh] [irritated] And I'm walking to the bus stop all grumpy and whatever, and I'm like, this day is just— this day is already ruined before it even— [surprised] [brightening] Wait, oh my god. There's this little place right here I've never noticed before. Like literally two blocks from my apartment. "Rosewood Coffee" or something cute like that. [delighted] Dude, this place is amazing. The coffee is incredible, way better than my stupid machine makes anyway, and the guy behind the counter was so nice, and it's like— it's cheaper than Starbucks! [warm] [realizing] I think... I think my coffee maker breaking was actually like the best thing that could've happened. I have a new spot now!
346  [casual] Oh, you know what happened earlier? This tourist stopped me on Fifth Street asking for directions to the art museum. Nice older couple, seemed really excited about it. [light laugh] I was like, oh yeah, super easy, just go straight down to Main, take a left, and you can't miss it. [conversational] They were so grateful too, you know? Like, "Oh thank you so much, you're so kind!" Made me feel all helpful and local. [chuckle] I was practically strutting after that, like look at me being a good citizen and everything. [slight pause] [a bit uncertain] But wait, actually... [trailing off] Main Street, left... that would take them to... [pause] Hold on, where does that actually go? [growing concern] Oh no. Oh no no no. [nervous laugh] That's— that's not the art museum. That's the industrial district. There's literally nothing down there except, like, warehouses and that weird fish processing plant. [increasingly distressed] They're probably still walking around right now! This sweet elderly couple wandering through loading docks because I— [groan] because I mixed up my lefts and rights like some kind of— [frustrated exhale] [spiraling] [guilty] Oh my god, they trusted me! They probably think I did it on purpose! [whimper] They're lost and it's all my fault and I'll never see them again to apologize and— [defeated] Great. Just great.
347  [matter-of-fact] So I returned that bluetooth speaker yesterday, you know, the one I got last week? It just— the sound quality was terrible, like really tinny, and for eighty bucks I expected better. Pretty straightforward return, got my receipt, they said seven to ten business days. [casual] Actually, let me just check if it went through yet. [pause] I mean, it's only been a day but sometimes these things are faster than they say, right? [slightly confused] Hm, that's weird. It says here the return was... denied? [scoff] That doesn't make sense, I literally just dropped it off yesterday with all the original packaging. [more concerned] Wait, denied for what reason? "Item shows signs of damage not consistent with normal use." What? [frustrated laugh] What damage? I used it for like three days! [building frustration] Oh, oh this is rich. So now I don't have the speaker AND I don't have my money? They're just keeping both? [sharp exhale] How is that legal? [spiraling] Eighty dollars! Just— gone! For a product I don't even have anymore that they're claiming I somehow destroyed! [huff] What am I supposed to do, drive back there and argue with some teenager about "damage" that doesn't exist? [exasperated] [bitter laugh] This is insane. This is actual theft. They have my money and my product and I have nothing but a stupid email telling me I'm a liar!
348  [excited] [breathless] Oh my God, okay, so you know how Sarah's birthday is on Saturday? I've been planning this whole surprise party for like three weeks now and it's— it's going to be perfect. I got everyone to agree to come, even her sister who lives like two hours away. [giddy] And I found this little bakery that makes those lemon cupcakes she's obsessed with, you know the ones from that place that closed down? They do the exact same recipe and I ordered like four dozen because you know how she gets about sharing dessert. [laugh] [animated] I've been so good about keeping it secret too, like when she was like "oh I don't know what I'm doing for my birthday, probably just staying in" I was like "yeah totally, low-key sounds nice" when inside I'm just— I'm dying to tell her about all the decorations I bought. [suddenly worried] Wait, hold on, she's texting me right now... um... [voice cracking] [emotional] Oh. Oh my God. She says "thank you for planning something so special for me, I can't wait to be surprised on Saturday." [crying happy tears] [overwhelmed] She— she knows and she's just... she's letting me surprise her anyway? That's so— [sniff] God, that's so Sarah. She probably figured it out days ago and just wanted me to have my moment.
349  [frustrated] Oh my god, so I'm on the plane today, right? And there's this baby— like literally right behind me— just screaming. Like, full-on wailing for like twenty minutes straight. [annoyed] And I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to be understanding because babies cry, whatever, but I had such a long day and I just wanted to close my eyes for like five minutes. But no, this kid is just— [groan] it was so loud. [irritated] The mom looked exhausted too, but like, I don't know, maybe walk around with it? Do something? I kept turning around and giving these looks, which I know is terrible but I was just so— [quieter] Oh wait. Actually, hold on. [softer] [realizing] The baby just... it just went completely quiet. Like, dead silent. And I can see the mom over the seat, she's just holding this tiny little thing and it's totally passed out on her shoulder. [guilty] [warm] God, she looks so relieved. Like, actually about to cry herself. [small laugh] I feel like such an asshole now for being annoyed. She was probably more stressed than anyone, trying to calm down her kid while people like me are glaring at her. [sheepish] Yeah, I'm... I'm definitely the villain in this story.
350  [annoyed] Oh my god, so I'm walking to work this morning, right? And I've got this podcast queued up that I've been like obsessed with lately— it's about that whole crypto scandal thing? Anyway, I'm like twenty minutes into this episode and suddenly my app just like [scoff] completely crashes. [frustrated] Just gone. Black screen, won't restart, the whole thing. And I'm standing there on the corner like jabbing at my phone like an idiot because I was right in the middle of this crazy part where they're about to reveal who was behind the whole scheme, you know? [irritated] So I'm like great, just great. Now I have to remember where I was, probably gonna have to scrub through the whole episode again to find my spot. You know how impossible that is with these true crime things? Like every part sounds the same when you're trying to— [surprised] Wait, hold on. Let me just... I'm opening it now to show you how annoying this is gonna be. [amazed] [pleased] Oh. Oh wow, it— it actually saved my place perfectly. Like exactly where it cut out. That little timeline thing is sitting right at 23 minutes and 40 seconds. [warm] [slightly embarrassed] Okay, that's... that's actually kind of impressive. [small laugh] I was so ready to write a angry review and everything.
351  [casual] Oh, so, um, I had this weird thing today. There was this, uh, this charge on my credit card for like forty-three dollars from some, um, some company I'd never heard of? So I was like, you know, whatever, I'll just, uh, I'll just dispute it real quick. [matter-of-fact] It was called like, um, "Premium Services Solutions" or something equally, uh, equally sketchy sounding, you know? I mean, I definitely didn't— I didn't sign up for any premium, um, any premium anything recently, so, uh, yeah, seemed pretty obvious. [conversational] So I'm, um, I'm telling you this because I just got the, uh, the email back from my bank and— oh wait, hang on. [exhales] Let me just, um, let me check what they said about— [confused] Oh. Oh wait. Okay so, um, so they're saying it was— it was legitimate? And they're like, uh, listing all this evidence and— wait, what is— what is this? [growing concern] It says here that it was for, um, for my software subscription that I, uh— [sharp exhale] Oh no. Oh no no no. That's— that's my, um, my design software that I use for work. The one that, uh, that auto-renews every month. [panicking] [groaning] Oh my god, I just— I just disputed my own, um, my own legitimate charge! They probably think I'm some kind of, uh, some kind of scammer now! I'm probably flagged in their system as like, uh, as someone who tries to— [frustrated laugh] who tries to steal forty-three dollars! [spiraling] [mortified] Great! Just— just great! Now I have to, um, I have to call them back and be like "Hey, sorry, I'm just, uh, I'm just an idiot who can't remember what I, um, what I pay for!" [defeated groan] This is— this is so embarrassing!
352  [casual] Oh, so you know how Jake was asking about getting to the new coffee place on Fifth? I told him about that little shortcut through the alley behind the old warehouse district. Saves like ten minutes, totally worth it. [conversational] He seemed pretty grateful, you know? Said he was gonna check it out this afternoon since he had that interview nearby. I was like, yeah, perfect timing, you'll beat all the traffic on Main Street. [slight pause] [thoughtful] Actually, now that I think about it... when was the last time I even went through there? It's been a while, hasn't it? Maybe like... [trailing off] maybe a few months? [a bit uncertain] Wait, didn't they... didn't they tear down some of those buildings recently? For the construction project? [nervous laugh] I mean, it's probably fine, right? It's not like they'd block off a whole— [realization dawning] Oh. Oh no. [sharp intake] The news story. About the break-ins in that area. That was— that was last week, wasn't it? [growing panic] Oh my god, I sent him through there alone! With his laptop bag! For an interview! [voice rising] What if something happens to him? What if he gets mugged or— [frantic] I have to call him. I have to call him right now. This is all my fault!
353  [furious] Oh my God, I am so— I am SO mad right now. Some absolute moron scratched my car in the parking lot at work today. Like a big, long scratch right down the side of my door. [heated] And of course they didn't leave a note or anything, because why would they? Why would anyone take responsibility for their actions? [scoff] I literally just got that car detailed like two weeks ago, it was perfect. [frustrated] I'm gonna have to take it to a body shop, get an estimate, deal with insurance— this is gonna cost me like hundreds of dollars probably. And for what? Because some idiot can't park properly or open their door like a normal human being? [ranting] I was walking around the whole parking lot trying to figure out who did it, like looking at other cars for paint marks or whatever, but— God, people are just so inconsiderate, I swear. [quieter] [confused] Wait, hold on. Let me just— I'm looking at it again right now and... huh. Actually, um... [embarrassed] [half laugh] Oh. Oh wow, okay. It's— it's coming off. Like I'm just rubbing it with my finger and it's... that's just dirt or something. It's not actually scratched. [sheepish] [small laugh] I feel like such an idiot. I was ready to file a police report over some mud.
354  [casual] Oh, I keep meaning to send this email to my boss about the quarterly report. I've had it sitting in my drafts forever. [light laugh] You know how it is, you write something and then you're like, "I'll just review it one more time" and then it just... sits there. [conversational] It's about those budget projections she asked for. Nothing major, just some numbers she needed for the board meeting. I remember being pretty thorough with it actually, did all the charts and everything. [slightly concerned] Wait, let me just check when I actually wrote this thing. [pause] Okay, pulling up my drafts now... where is it... there it is. Um. [nervous laugh] This says... March fifteenth? [growing worried] March fifteenth. That's— that's like three weeks ago. The board meeting was... [trailing off] oh no. Oh no no no. [panic building] The board meeting was March twentieth! She needed this for the board meeting and I— [sharp exhale] I just let it sit in my drafts like some kind of— ugh! [spiraling] She probably thinks I completely ignored her request! Or that I'm totally incompetent! She's probably been covering for me this whole time, making excuses about why the numbers weren't ready, and I've just been walking around like everything's fine! [frantic] [horrified] Oh my god, what if this affects the whole quarterly review? What if they made decisions without the data? [groan] I'm so fired. I'm so, so fired.
355  [frustrated] So you know how my sister's birthday was like two weeks ago? And I'm sitting there waiting for her card to show up, and waiting, and I'm like— where is it? Like I sent hers on time, obviously. [annoyed] It finally comes today and I'm just, ugh, I'm so irritated about it, you know? Like it's got this little note about how sorry she is it's late, blah blah, and I'm like— just send it on time? It's not that hard to put something in the mail. [still annoyed] I almost didn't even want to open it because I was so— I was just being petty about the whole thing. Like why does she always do this? Birthdays, Christmas, everything's always late with her. [surprised] But then I— oh wait, there's like— [rustling sound] there's cash in here. Like actual cash, not just a check. [softer] [slightly guilty] Oh. There's... there's like a hundred bucks in here. And this note about how she wanted to get me something special but didn't know what, so she thought I could pick something out myself. [warm] [embarrassed] God, I feel like such a— [half laugh] here I am being all mad about it being late and she put like actual thought into this. Way more than I put into hers, honestly.
356  [frustrated] Ugh, okay so you know how I've been planning Jake's surprise party for like three weeks? Well apparently his sister totally ruined it today. She just— she just blurted it out when they were having lunch, like "oh I can't wait for your party tonight!" [annoyed] I'm so mad, like I specifically told everyone to keep it quiet, and she just— [sigh] I don't know why I even bothered. I spent so much time coordinating with everyone, getting the cake, decorating... [defeated] So now he knows, and I'm just sitting here feeling like an idiot because the whole surprise is blown and I don't even know if I should still— if we should still do it or just cancel the whole thing. [confused] Wait, he's— he's calling me right now. Hold on, let me just— Hello? Oh hey Jake, I'm so sorry about— what? What do you mean what party? [realization dawning] Wait, you— you don't know about tonight? But Sarah said she told you about— Oh my god. [half laugh] Oh my GOD. She was talking about Mom's birthday party next weekend! [excited] [relieved] He has no idea! The surprise is still— it's still a surprise! [laugh] I almost had a heart attack for nothing. Sarah was talking about a completely different party this whole time!
357  [frustrated] Oh my God, I'm so pissed right now. You know that internship at the design firm I've been wanting forever? The one I told you about like a million times? Well they— they filled it. Just like that. [bitter] I was supposed to hear back today and instead I get this like super generic email being like "thank you for your interest, we've decided to go with another candidate." Like, thanks for nothing. I was so ready to quit my stupid retail job and actually do something, you know, meaningful with my summer. [defeated] And the worst part is I turned down that thing at my mom's friend's office because I was so sure I was gonna get this one. So now I'm just— I'm stuck folding sweaters for another three months while everyone else gets these amazing opportunities and— [surprised] Wait, hold on. My phone's buzzing and it's... oh. Oh wow, it's Professor Chen from my portfolio class. [excited] [disbelieving] She— okay she says the creative director at her old agency just called her looking for an intern and she immediately thought of me? And it's paid. Like, actually paid. Way more than that other place was offering. [laughing] [amazed] I literally cannot believe this. This is so much better than— God, maybe getting rejected was actually the best thing that could've happened.
358  [efficiently] Absolutely, pet stains are no problem at all. [briskly] I'm adding that note right now—bathrooms, kitchen, pet stain priority. [warmly] Marcus has fifteen years experience, and honestly, [chuckles] he's seen everything. Your house will be spotless, I promise.
359  [Happy] Oh wow, this is, uh, this is really something special, isn't it? [Nervous laugh] I mean, who wouldn't want to spend their whole Saturday doing this?
360  [Fast] No no no, I love it, seriously, it's like—it's exactly what I was hoping for! [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Absolutely perfect.
361  [Slow] You know what? [Sigh] This is actually... growing on me, I think.
362  [Whisper] I'm gonna tell everyone about this. [Chuckle] They're not gonna believe how, um, how incredible this experience has been.
363  [Shout] This is amazing! [Disappointed] I mean—yeah, totally my thing, you know?
364  [Happy] I could literally do this all day long, it's so—wait, we're doing this again next week too? [Groan] Great!
365  [Angry] Why would anyone not enjoy this? [Fast] It's basically the best thing ever, right?
366  [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm having the time of my life here. [Laugh] Can't you tell by my face?
367  [Sad] No, I'm excited, really, it's just that I—I guess I'm overwhelmed by how much fun this is gonna be.
368  [Disappointed] Sure, let's keep going for another hour. [Tsk] [Whisper] Or three.
369  [Happy] My friends are gonna be so jealous when they hear I got to—actually, maybe I won't tell them. [Chuckle]
370  [Fast] [Angry] Look, I said I liked it, okay? What more do you want from me?
371  [Slow] This is, um, definitely an experience I'll never forget. [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Lucky me.
372  [Whisper] Honestly? [Happy] Best birthday present ever—exactly what I wanted!
373  [Shout] Woo! [Disappointed] Let's, uh, let's definitely make this a regular thing, I guess.
374  [Sad] It's fine, it's fine, I mean—who needs to be doing literally anything else right now? [Tsk]
375  [Chuckle] You really went all out with this, didn't you? [Fast] I'm so touched that you thought of me for this particular... opportunity.
376  [Angry] [Slow] I don't know why you think I'm not enjoying myself—this is exactly my kind of torture—I mean, fun.
377  [Happy] Can we do the whole thing over again from the beginning? [Groan] [Whisper] Please say no.
378  [Sarcastic] Wow, and here I thought my day couldn't get any better. [Laugh] [Disappointed] You really know me so well.
379  [casual] Oh, I posted that thing about the coffee shop earlier, you know? The one with the weird latte art that looked like a blob. [light laugh] I thought it was pretty funny. [conversational] Let me just check if anyone— oh, nice, okay, getting some likes. Sarah commented with the crying-laughing emoji, which, yeah, she gets it. [slightly pleased] Actually doing pretty well, like twenty-three likes already. Not bad for— wait. [pause] Wait, who is... [uncertain] Oh. Oh no. My boss liked it. Which is... fine, I guess? But then she— [nervous laugh] she commented too. [growing concern] She wrote "So this is what you call 'working from the coffee shop' haha." With the little winky face emoji. [forced laugh] Which is... it's a joke, right? She's joking? [anxious] But like, I was actually working there this morning when I posted that. I had my laptop, I was answering emails, I was being productive! [rambling faster] But now I'm thinking, did it look like I was just goofing off? Taking pictures of coffee instead of working? [spiraling] Oh my god, what if she thinks I'm not taking my job seriously? What if this gets brought up in my review? [panicked] I'm gonna get fired because of a stupid latte post! [groan] Why did I even post that?
380  What? No, I was just—come on, I was joking around. You know I didn't mean it like that. Everyone was laughing about their own stuff too, it wasn't just you.
381  Okay okay, but you're acting like I—like I deliberately tried to humiliate you or something. [Scoff] That's not what happened and you know it. We always mess with each other like that.
382  I mean... did I though? You never said it was off limits. I'm supposed to just, what, read your mind about which things are okay to joke about and which aren't?
383  That's—wow, okay. So now I don't have common sense. Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're kinda blowing this way out of proportion here. It was literally five seconds of teasing.
384  Nobody's gonna remember it by next week, I promise you. You're the only one still thinking about it. And honestly? [Frustrated laugh] You've said way worse stuff about my hobbies before.
385  How? How is it different? Because—no seriously, explain it to me. Because from where I'm standing, it looks pretty much the same except you can dish it out but can't take it.
386  And I didn't—ugh, I didn't do it to hurt you either! That's what I'm trying to tell you. It was supposed to be fun, y'know? Light. Not this whole... thing.
387  Yeah, I'm—I'm getting that now, obviously. But like, instead of just telling me "hey that bothered me," you're giving me the silent treatment and acting like I'm some terrible friend. [Sigh] That's not really fair either.
388  Because you won't let me! You're so busy being mad that you're not even—fine fine, I'm sorry I teased you about your music. There. But I still think you're overreacting.
389  Well it's the best you're gonna get right now because honestly? I'm kinda hurt too that you think I'd ever intentionally—whatever. I need some air. We can talk when you actually wanna listen.
390  I know, I know, I'm sorry—but I literally couldn't. I was having a full-on panic attack in my car and I—I couldn't even text you properly because my hands were shaking so bad.
391  That's not—okay, that's not entirely fair. I've shown up to plenty of things. You're making it sound like I never come through for you, which is just... [scoff] that's not true.
392  Um, your birthday? Your—wait, no, I had to leave early. But I was there! And before that, I went to your sister's wedding, remember? Even though I was basically dying inside the whole time.
393  Because I was literally having trouble breathing! What do you want me to do, pass out at the reception? I'm trying here, I really am, but my anxiety isn't just—it's not something I can turn off.
394  And I appreciate that, I do, but honestly? I didn't ask you to. [frustrated laugh] Like, I'm already beating myself up about this stuff constantly, y'know? I don't need the guilt trip on top of it.
395  That's—no, come on, that's not what I meant. You know that's not what I meant. I just... I'm doing my best here, okay? I'm in therapy, I'm on meds, I'm trying trying trying to get better.
396  Wow. Okay. So what, you're just—you're done with me then? Because I have a mental illness that sometimes means I can't show up the way you want me to?
397  Yeah, well, good for you! Seriously, that's—that's great that yours is manageable enough for that. Mine isn't. [sigh] And I hate that about myself, trust me, but acting like I'm choosing this is just... it's kinda cruel, honestly.
398  Because I'm always hoping I can push through! I don't wanna be the friend who cancels, so I wait and wait and then suddenly I can't and—okay, yeah, maybe I should text sooner. Fine. That's valid.
399  Okay okay, I should. I should text sooner. But you gotta understand, I'm not flaking 'cause I don't care about you. It's literally the opposite—I care so much that the pressure makes everything worse, y'know?
400  Wait wait wait—are you serious? Oh my god, that's like—that's huge! How long have you been paying on that thing?
401  Four years of just... ugh, I can't even imagine. Do you feel, like, different? Because honestly when I paid off my student loans I literally [Laugh] cried in my car for like twenty minutes.
402  No no no, don't even—don't put that energy out there! You did this, okay? That's like, what, hundreds of dollars back in your pocket every month now?
403  Three hundred and—okay that's basically rent money! What are you gonna do with all that extra cash? Please tell me you're gonna treat yourself to something.
404  Of course you are. [Sigh] I mean, that's smart, that's really smart, but like... you gotta celebrate a little bit, right? This is a big deal!
405  Oh—oh that's perfect actually! Because now it's like, really yours, y'know? No more bank breathing down your neck about every little scratch or whatever.
406  Right right, but still—I dunno, there's something about actually owning it that just... it hits different. Like you could literally drive it off a cliff tomorrow and nobody could stop you. Not that you would! [Laugh] Obviously.
407  Okay but seriously though, this is like—this is such a grown-up milestone. I'm kinda jealous honestly. I've still got two more years on mine.
408  Yeah? Did you do anything special to pay it off early or just... stuck with the regular payments?
409  See that's—that's what I admire about you though. You just quietly get stuff done while the rest of us are out here like, making these big dramatic plans that never actually happen, y'know?
410  Oh my god, I know—I know I did and I'm literally the worst friend ever. I had it in my calendar, I swear I did, but then my phone died and I—that's not even a good excuse, is it?
411  Wait wait wait, the third—okay yeah, you're right. The dinner thing and then your promotion celebration... [groan] I'm just—I've been such a mess lately, you know? Like my head's been all over the place but that's not—that's not fair to you.
412  No no no, please don't say that. I mean—I get it, I totally get why you'd feel that way but like... I wanna fix this. I really, really wanna make this right because you're—you're super important to me, honestly.
413  Yes! God, yes, of course you are. I know it doesn't—okay I know my actions haven't been showing that lately [nervous laugh] but you are. I've just been really bad at... at following through on stuff and I hate that about myself right now.
414  I did. I—fuck, I did promise and I... I broke it. Again. There's no excuse that makes that okay, y'know? Like I could tell you about work being crazy or my anxiety being bad but that's—none of that matters because I let you down.
415  I know it was. And I should've—god, I should've been there. You worked so hard for that degree and I just... [sigh] I missed celebrating with you because I can't get my shit together. I'm so, so sorry.
416  You're right. It doesn't. I keep—I keep saying sorry and then doing the same thing over and over, don't I? That's like... that's basically the definition of being a shitty friend. I need to actually change, not just—not just apologize.
417  Would you—okay, I know I don't deserve it, but would you maybe give me one more chance? Like one actual last chance? I'm gonna put everything in multiple calendars, set alarms, I'll even—I'll text you the day before to confirm, every single time.
418  Because I'm—honestly? Because I'm scared of losing you. Like genuinely terrified. This conversation is making me realize how much I've been taking you for granted and I—[quieter] I can't lose you over my own stupidity. I won't let myself.
419  I will. I mean—no, I know that's what I always say. But I'm gonna prove it, okay? Actions, not words this time. Just... please don't give up on me yet? I know I don't deserve it but I'm—I'm gonna do better. I promise. And I know my promises don't mean much right now but... I'm gonna make them mean something again.
420  Wait wait wait—you WON? Like actually won won? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna crush it but—[Gasp] this is huge! Tell me everything!
421  Twenty THOUSAND—okay no, I'm literally gonna pass out. That's like... that's life-changing money! What was your project again? The thing with the—the AI something?
422  That's so—god, that's actually so important though. Like, you basically just made tech more inclusive and got paid for it? I'm honestly getting emotional right now.
423  Oh no no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you minimize your contribution. [Sigh] You always do this! You were literally up for like 36 hours straight coding, remember?
424  Coffee helped, he says. Right, okay, sure. So um, what happens now? Do you get to like—is there more to it or do they just hand you a giant check?
425  Are you gonna—I mean, you're gonna do it, right? This is like, this is your chance to turn it into something real! Unless you're not—sorry, I'm being pushy aren't I?
426  Oh. Oh shit, okay that's—that's actually a big deal. But like... when else are you gonna get an opportunity like this? [Chuckle] Sorry, I know, I know, it's complicated.
427  Of course they—I mean, they're parents, y'know? They worry. But honestly? You just proved you can literally create solutions that judges thought were worth twenty grand. That's gotta count for something.
428  Okay but like—can we at least celebrate first before you spiral into the whole practical adulting thing? Because you just WON A HACKATHON and I wanna buy you so many drinks right now!
429  Fine fine fine, mocktails then! Or—or ice cream? Pizza? Something! I'm not letting you just go home and pretend this didn't happen. This is literally the coolest thing ever and we're gonna—we're celebrating, okay?
430  [confused, sniffing] Okay, what is— what is that smell? That's, um, that's definitely not normal. It's like, I don't know, it's not bad exactly, but it's just... [inhale] weird? Like, um, like if you mixed vanilla with, uh, with something musty maybe? [muttering, moving around] Is it coming from the kitchen? I mean, I didn't cook anything weird today, just— just the usual stuff. But maybe something went bad in the, um, in the fridge? [sniff] No, no that's not it. It's not that kind of smell. [slightly puzzled] Wait, is it— is it coming from upstairs? [pause] Huh. It's like, it's following me around, which is, um, which is either really concerning or I'm just, uh, I'm just being paranoid about it now. [realization creeping in] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [sniff sniff] Is this my sweater? Did I, um— [laugh] oh my god, did I grab the wrong fabric softener or something? That would be so— [relieved, slightly embarrassed] Yep. Yep, it's definitely the sweater. Mystery solved. I'm just, uh, I'm just wearing weird-smelling laundry. [chuckle] Cool. Very detective of me.
431  [sniffling] Oh my god, Sarah, look at them in their tiny caps! [voice breaking] Remember when we couldn't even get them to wear pants? [louder, wavering] Now they're singing the alphabet like actual humans!
432  [high-pitched wail] Jackson just waved at me from the stage! [quieter] He looks so proud in his construction paper diploma. [sobbing] I can't handle how grown up he thinks he is right now.
433  [trembling whisper] They're about to sing that rainbow song. [increasingly hysterical] The one they practiced every single morning while I made lunches. [wailing] I'll never hear them practice it again in our kitchen!
434  [gulping air] Did you see them holding hands walking in? [steadier] All twenty tiny humans in a perfect line. [breaking again] Like they actually learned something about following directions this year!
435  [whispering intensely] Mrs. Peterson is crying harder than us. [normal volume] Her twins are her last ones going through preschool. [sympathetic moan] She just mouthed "help me" from across the auditorium, poor thing.
436  [dramatically] Why did we want them to grow up so fast? [softer, sadder] All those wishes for them to sleep through the night, walk, talk. [anguished] Now I'd give anything for one more baby snuggle!
437  [monotone] Other parents are staring at us. [defensive] Judge away, stone-hearted robots! [proudly sobbing] Our babies learned to share, use scissors, and not lick everything - that deserves these tears of pure joy!
438  [determined] We need to pull ourselves together for pictures. [shaky] My mother-in-law will never let me forget if I look like this. [desperate laugh] Do you have any tissues that aren't completely soaked through yet?
439  [suddenly calm] Oh wait, they're singing the goodbye song. [building hysteria] The one where they wave their hands like butterflies. [completely broken] This is it, this is the end of preschool innocence forever!
440  [philosophical] Honestly, I'm proud of us for feeling this deeply. [more warmly] These kids know they're loved by moms who ugly cry at every milestone. [firm] That's better than perfect mascara any day, right?
441  [professionally] Good morning, let me pull up your account. [reassuring] Ah yes, I can see the property at 42 Oakwood Avenue. [concerned] You're showing a reading of 8,742 kilowatt hours for just this month, which does seem unusual.
442  [thoughtfully] Let me check the meter serial number—is it SM-90-K-2847? [more seriously] Sometimes these smart meters can malfunction or, well, they might be reading from a neighboring property. When did you last physically check the meter yourself?
443  [sympathetic] That definitely sounds like a fault. [calmly] I'm going to log this as case number TK-2024-0913 for you. [helpfully] We'll need to send an engineer out, probably within 3 to 5 working days, to investigate.
444  [reassuring tone] Don't worry, we'll put a hold on the payment until this is resolved. [professionally] I'm adding note reference MH-47B to freeze any direct debit attempts. [more warmly] We usually find these issues are resolved quickly once the engineer takes a look.
445  [cheerfully] Absolutely, you'll get a text to 07—is it 07856-234-190?—with a 2-hour window. [efficiently] The engineer's reference will be ENG-8834-QM. [politely] Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your account today, or shall we get that engineer visit sorted first?
446  [professionally] Good afternoon, Dr. Martinez's office, this is Rachel speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today?
447  [sympathetically] Oh, I understand your frustration, let me just... [briskly] pull up your file here. [pause] Can you verify your date of birth and the specialist you were referred to?
448  [apologetically] I see the notes here about your previous calls. [quickly] The referral was sent on the tenth, but it looks like—[hesitant] well, there might have been an insurance verification delay.
449  [defensively] Sir, I understand you're upset, but we process dozens of referrals daily and [more firmly] sometimes the specialist's office takes time to—[quickly] actually, let me call them right now while you're on hold.
450  [reassuringly] I'm going to place you on a brief hold—two minutes maximum—and [more briskly] I'll contact Dr. Chen's scheduling department directly. [firmly] We'll get this sorted today, I promise.
451  [pause] Actually sir, I'm looking at your file more closely here. [surprised] It shows Dr. Chen's office sent us a request for additional medical records [quickly] on the twenty-second, but we never... responded?
452  [apologetically] This is absolutely our error, and I'm so sorry. [more quickly] I'm marking this as urgent priority right now, and [determined] I will personally fax those records within the next ten minutes.
453  [professionally] Absolutely, I'll email you a confirmation with a tracking number for the referral. [quickly] Also, I'm giving you my direct extension—[clearly] two two seven—so you can reach me personally for updates.
454  [confidently] I'm putting a flag in our system to alert me of any incoming requests from Dr. Chen's office. [more reassuringly] Plus, I'll call them after I send the fax to [briskly] confirm receipt and get you a tentative appointment date.
455  [efficiently] I'll call you back within two hours with confirmation, and [quickly] Dr. Chen's office typically schedules within forty-eight hours of receiving completed referrals. [warmly] I've noted your cell number here—is that still the best way to reach you?
456  [Disappointed] Oh. Oh no, I—I really thought I had it this time, you know? [Sigh] This is, uh, this is embarrassing.
457  [Fast] Wait wait wait, so you're telling me that the whole thing was—that I completely misunderstood? [Laugh] Wow, okay, I'm an idiot.
458  [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I spent three hours arguing about this and I was just—completely wrong the entire time?!
459  [Slow] So let me get this straight... everything I've been saying for the past, like, six months has been based on bad information? [Tsk]
460  [Happy] You know what? I'm actually kinda relieved to be wrong about this one! [Chuckle] That's, um, that's way better than what I thought.
461  [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, just fantastic—I only told, what, literally everyone I know? [Groan] This is gonna be fun to explain.
462  [Whisper] I can't believe I just—in front of all those people, I said... [Sad] God, they must think I'm such a fool.
463  [Disappointed] Honestly? I was so sure, like absolutely certain that I—[Sigh] I guess I should've actually checked first, huh?
464  [Fast] No no no, that can't be—I mean, I literally have the email right here that says—oh. [Slow] Oh, I misread it completely.
465  [Angry] This is such—ugh, I hate being wrong about stuff like this! [Tsk] Especially when I was so confident about it.
466  [Happy] Well, um, at least we figured it out before the presentation tomorrow, right? [Laugh] That would've been a disaster!
467  [Sad] I really wanted to be right about this one, you know? It's just—it made so much sense in my head. [Sigh]
468  [Sarcastic] Great, so basically I've been living my entire life thinking that—wow, okay, that's not humiliating at all. [Chuckle] Perfect.
469  [Whisper] Could you, uh, could you maybe not tell anyone about this? [Fast] I mean, I'll fix it, I'll totally fix it, but just—yeah.
470  [Slow] You're absolutely sure though? Because I could've sworn that the book said—actually, you know what, doesn't matter anymore. [Disappointed] [Groan]
471  [Shout] How did I miss something so obvious?! [Angry] It was literally right there the whole time and I just—I completely ignored it!
472  [Happy] Okay so, plot twist—I'm totally wrong but honestly? [Chuckle] Kinda makes the whole thing funnier if you think about it.
473  [Sad] I, um, I owe you an apology then, don't I? [Slow] All those times I corrected you and I was actually the one who was—yeah. [Sigh]
474  [Fast] Hold on, let me just—I gotta process this for a second because my entire worldview just kinda—[Laugh] This changes literally everything!
475  [Disappointed] Mm-hmm, yep, there it is in black and white. [Tsk] I dunno how I managed to convince myself otherwise, but here we are.
476  [casual] Oh, so, um, I put this cute little sticker on my laptop today. It was like, uh, this rainbow holographic thing? I thought it would, um, you know, brighten up the boring black cover a bit. [matter-of-fact] But then I was like, eh, maybe it's, um, maybe it's a bit much for work meetings and stuff. So I figured I'd just, uh, just peel it off real quick before my next call. [slightly concerned] Except it's not— it's not coming off clean, you know? Like there's this, um, this weird sticky residue and it's— oh no, wait. [sharp exhale] I think it's actually, um, it's actually taking some of the laptop finish with it? [more worried] Oh god, there's like— there's like a pale spot now where the sticker was. The, uh, the black coating is literally— it's literally peeling off in little, um, in little flakes with the adhesive. [panicking] This is a work laptop! This is— oh my god, what am I gonna— how do I explain to IT that I, um, that I damaged company property with a— with a rainbow sticker? [nervous laugh] They're gonna think I'm twelve years old! [spiraling] And now I can't get the sticky stuff off and it's worse— it's so much worse than just leaving the sticker! It looks like, um, like I attacked it with— with sandpaper or something! [groan] Why did I— why did I do this? It was fine! It was perfectly fine!
477  Oh god, okay—I know how this looks, but I swear I didn't think he'd actually come? Like, I invited a bunch of people and he was just—I mean, I didn't specifically invite him, it was more of a group text situation and—
478  Wait wait wait, it's not—okay yes, technically it's your birthday thing but I thought—[nervous laugh] I honestly thought he wouldn't show up. He literally never comes to anything anymore.
479  I didn't—ugh, okay, I guess I did but it wasn't like... deliberate? You know how I am, I just kinda added everyone from the usual group and I wasn't thinking—I'm so sorry, I wasn't thinking about how that would make you feel.
480  No no no, that came out wrong. I mean—I was thinking, just not... properly? Like my brain was on autopilot and I—god, this sounds so stupid. [sigh] I really really messed up, didn't I?
481  I can uninvite him! I'll—I'll text him right now and just say something came up or—or that we had to change the plans or something. Would that help? I wanna fix this.
482  You're right, you're—you're totally right. That would probably make it worse, honestly. Um, what if I—okay, hear me out—what if I plan something different? Like just us and the core group, no Marcus, somewhere he definitely won't be?
483  No! No, that's not—ugh, I'm making this worse. [groan] I'm sorry, I'm just trying to—I dunno, make it right somehow? You have every right to be pissed at me. I'm literally the worst friend.
484  I know, I know I am. And I hate that about myself, y'know? Like I genuinely don't mean to be but then I do stuff like this and—I promise I'll be better. I'll actually think before I do things, especially when it comes to you and... him.
485  Of course you did. Of course. And I—I took that away from you and that's so unfair. You deserve to celebrate without having to worry about your ex being there. I'm really, really sorry. Like from the bottom of my heart sorry.
486  I get it, I totally get it. And I'll—I'll handle it, okay? I'll make sure you two don't have to interact at all. I'll literally be your human buffer the entire night if you want me to. Whatever you need.
487  I wasn't—okay, maybe I was a little short with them, but honestly? I'm just looking out for you. You've been together what, two months? And already they're trying to control who you hang out with?
488  Come on, seriously? They literally got upset because you wanted to have one night with your friends. That's—that's not normal, okay? And I'm supposed to just smile and pretend everything's fine?
489  Mean? I barely said like five words to them all night. [Scoff] Look, I'm sorry if I wasn't super friendly, but I'm not gonna fake being best friends with someone who I think is—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.
490  See, this is what I'm talking about! You used to actually listen when I had concerns about stuff. Now it's like—Alex says jump and you're already in the air. I'm not trying to be a jerk here, I'm worried about you.
491  Yeah, worried! Is that so hard to believe? We've been friends for how long? And suddenly I'm the bad guy because I don't immediately love your new partner who, by the way, has been kinda sketchy about their whole situation?
492  I mean—look look, their story keeps changing. First they were "between jobs," then they were freelancing, now they're starting a business? [Frustrated laugh] And you're paying for everything, which—fine, your money, but come on.
493  It is when you're borrowing money from me last week! I'm not—okay okay, I shouldn't have brought that up. But you gotta understand why I'm not exactly thrilled about this whole thing, right?
494  I wasn't passive-aggressive, I was just... distant. There's a difference. And honestly? I thought I was being pretty restrained considering I wanted to say something way more direct about the whole situation.
495  That's—[groan] you know what? Fine. I'm sorry I wasn't nicer to Alex. There. But I'm not sorry for being concerned, and I'm definitely not gonna pretend I like them when I don't. That's not who I am.
496  Are you—are you serious right now? You're gonna throw away our entire friendship over someone you barely know? Because I was a little cold at dinner? I mean, if that's what you want, fine fine, but that's on you, not me.
497  Oh god, I know—I know exactly what you're gonna say and you're right. I shouldn't have mentioned Tyler, I just—the story was so relevant and I wasn't thinking and—
498  Wait, third? I mean—okay yeah, you're right. Monday at coffee, Wednesday at your place, and then... [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever, aren't I? I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time.
499  I—that's not—okay I did but it wasn't about him, y'know? It was just funny and I thought—no, you're right. It was his story. I shouldn't have. I'm sorry, I really am.
500  What? No! No no no, absolutely not. I haven't talked to Tyler since you guys—I would never do that to you. I just have this stupid habit where I can't filter what comes out of my mouth [nervous laugh] and apparently that includes your ex.
501  I know, and you're—you're doing so well, honestly. Like, you're amazing. And here I am just... sabotaging everything because I can't shut up about—god, I'm so sorry. I genuinely don't mean to bring him up, it just happens.
502  That's not—no, that's ridiculous. I mean, sure, we were all friends but—okay wait, that came out wrong. What I'm trying to say is, you're my priority here, not him. Always you.
503  Yeah, I... I get that. [sigh] I really messed up, huh? It's like—I dunno, sometimes I forget that mentioning him actually hurts you because you seem so okay, but that's—that's not an excuse. I should know better.
504  Oh. Oh man, I—I didn't realize. That's... I'm making everything worse, aren't I? Every time I bring him up it's like—it's like I'm ripping off a bandaid or something. God, I'm such an idiot.
505  Yeah, that's—that's fair. More than fair, actually. Look, I'm gonna try harder, okay? Like, really try. Maybe you could, um, give me a signal or something if I start doing it again? Just like, kick me under the table or whatever?
506  Right. Yeah. Obviously that's—that's the actual solution here. No more Tyler stories, no more Tyler references, no more anything Tyler-related. I promise. And I mean it this time, I swear. You deserve so much better from me as a friend.
507  I—okay, yes, but you weren't answering anyone's calls for like three days and we were all freaking out. I didn't know what else to—I mean, someone had to know what was going on.
508  Look look, I get that you're pissed, but you literally disappeared after getting that news. What was I supposed to think? That you were just, I dunno, taking a mental health break? [Scoff] Come on.
509  And I—I respect that, usually, you know I do. But this wasn't some random gossip thing. Marcus was gonna drive to your apartment to check if you were even alive. I was trying to stop him from doing something worse.
510  That's not—ugh, you're making it sound so calculated. It wasn't like that. I was scared, okay? Like genuinely [frustrated laugh] terrified that something had happened to you. Sorry for caring, I guess.
511  Do what? Be honest about being worried? You're acting like I posted it on Facebook or something. It was one person—one person who was also losing his mind about you.
512  I know! I know it's yours, and I shouldn't have—but also, you shouldn't have just vanished without telling anyone you were okay. That's kinda messed up too, if we're being honest here.
513  And I—I get that, I really do. But three days? No response to like forty texts? You can't just drop a bomb like that and then disappear and expect everyone to be—to just sit there and wait patiently.
514  That's not what I'm saying and you know it. [Sigh] Your privacy matters, obviously, but so does—I mean, we're supposed to be friends. Friends don't let friends spiral alone.
515  Okay okay, fine. You're right. I messed up. But I'm not gonna apologize for being worried about you when you literally gave us every reason to think—whatever. You obviously don't wanna hear it.
516  Great. So we're just gonna—you're gonna stay mad forever then? Because I made one mistake while trying to make sure you didn't—you know what, forget it. I'm done defending myself for giving a shit.
517  Oh god, okay—I've been thinking about this all night. I know I messed up when you were telling me about the work thing and I just... I kept saying it wasn't that bad, right? That's—that's what this is about?
518  Wait wait wait, I didn't—okay, you're right. You're totally right. I keep doing this thing where you tell me something and I'm like "oh but at least" or whatever and I just [nervous laugh] I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time, y'know?
519  No no no, that's not—I mean, I said you might be reading too much into it but that's not the same as—actually, no, you're right. God. That's literally the same thing, isn't it? I'm such an idiot.
520  I know, I know. And instead I kept trying to like... fix it? Or make you feel better by saying it wasn't so bad? Which is so stupid because obviously that doesn't—that's not helpful at all. [Sigh] I think I thought I was helping but I was just... wasn't I?
521  Oh my god, no—your feelings absolutely matter. They matter so much and I'm—I'm honestly horrified that I made you feel that way. Like, you're one of my best friends and I just kept... basically telling you that you were wrong about your own feelings? That's so messed up.
522  I think I—okay this isn't an excuse, but maybe I was projecting? Like when I'm upset I want someone to tell me it's gonna be okay, but that's not—that's not what you need and I should've actually listened instead of just... talking over your feelings.
523  You did. You literally did and I just—I remember now, you said you needed me to just listen and I said "of course" and then I kept doing the exact same thing. [Groan] I'm like the worst friend ever, aren't I?
524  I wanna—I really wanna do better. I mean it. Maybe I could like, literally put tape over my mouth next time? Kidding, but seriously, I'm gonna try so hard to just... shut up and listen. You deserve that. You deserve someone who actually hears you.
525  And if I start doing it again—which I probably will because apparently I have zero self-awareness—just like, tell me to stop? Call me out immediately? I promise I won't get defensive or anything, I just... I genuinely don't realize when I'm doing it.
526  Thank you. For telling me, I mean. And for—for not just giving up on me entirely even though you'd have every right to. I'm really, really sorry. Like truly. I'm gonna work on this, I promise.
527  Oh god, okay—I know how it looked. I know. But I was trying to—I mean, I mentioned you! I said "we" like five times, I swear I did.
528  Wait wait wait, I—okay maybe not in that exact moment but I was gonna circle back to it! The boss just kept asking questions and I got caught up in explaining everything and—[nervous laugh] shit, I really didn't mention you at all, did I?
529  No no no, that's not—I mean, yeah, those words came out but I didn't mean it like—ugh, I'm such an idiot. I got nervous! You know how I get when everyone's looking at me, I just start talking and talking and—
530  I know. I know, and honestly? I feel sick about it. Like literally haven't eaten since yesterday because my stomach is just—I wanna give it back. I'll tell them tomorrow it was your idea, all of it.
531  I will! I mean it—I'm gonna march in there first thing and—actually no, I'll email them right now. [groan] God, they probably think I'm some creative genius when really I just... I stole from my best friend. That's what I did, isn't it?
532  I'm so sorry. Like, I can't even—there's no excuse, y'know? I just... I panicked and then it snowballed and suddenly everyone was clapping and I couldn't figure out how to stop it without looking like a complete fraud.
533  Yeah. Yeah, I am. You're right. I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever and I don't blame you if you never wanna talk to me again but please, just... let me fix this? Please?
534  Three months and twelve days. I know because I—I kept track of every late night, every coffee run, every time you stayed up fixing my stupid coding errors. You did like ninety percent of the work and I just... presented it. [quieter] I presented it like it was mine.
535  I know. And I—I broke that, didn't I? Completely shattered it for a stupid promotion that I don't even—I don't even want it if it means losing you as a friend. Nothing's worth that.
536  First thing, I promise. And I'll—I'll put it in writing too, make sure there's documentation that it was your concept, your execution, your everything. I just... I'm really, really sorry. I hope you can forgive me. Eventually, I mean. Whenever you're ready. If you ever are.
537  [muttering] Okay, so I need to— I need to find, um, Maple Street, and it should be coming up soon because I've been walking for like— [sigh] how long have I been walking? [slower, uncertain] Wait. Wait wait wait. That building, I— I think I passed that building before? Like, um, like twenty minutes ago? But that doesn't— that doesn't make sense because I've been going straight this whole time. [slight realization creeping in] Oh no. Oh, um, oh no no no. I think I— [groan] I think I went the wrong way when I left the coffee shop. I was supposed to go, uh, I was supposed to go left, wasn't I? Not right? [frustrated but resigned] Great. So I've been walking in completely the wrong direction for— for how long? Half an hour? This is, um, this is why I should just use my phone like a normal person instead of trying to, uh, trying to navigate like it's 1995. [pragmatic, sighing] Okay, so, um, I guess I just— I just turn around and walk all the way back? [tsk] At least I'm getting my steps in today, right? That's, uh— that's the silver lining here.
538  [shaking voice] There ain't no other way, Jake. [bitter] The bank's coming tomorrow with the sheriff, and I'd rather see it burn [choking up] than watch them vultures pick apart what Pa built with his bare hands.
539  [harsh laugh] Remember when we thought we'd pass this place to our kids? [softer] Now look at us, holding torches like common outlaws. [determined growl] But they won't get the satisfaction of taking what's ours.
540  [urgently] We gotta do it now before I lose my nerve. [trembling] My hands are shaking something fierce, Jake. [more firmly] But watching them auction our home would kill what's left of my soul.
541  [weeping openly] God forgive us for what we're about to do. [angry shout] But those bastards left us no choice! [quieter] They took everything else—our savings, our dignity, our future.
542  [disbelieving] Can't believe it's really ending like this. [faster] All those years fighting weather, disease, raiders—survived everything except a banker's greed. [Hoarse whisper] This land was supposed to outlive us both.
543  [suddenly urgent] You hear that? [panicked] That's horses coming up the trail! [commanding] Light it now, Jake—throw the torch and let's ride before they get here!
544  [yelling over flames] The roof's going up! [desperate] We should go, but I can't look away. [Sobbing] Twenty years of my life turning to smoke, and I can't even look away.
545  [exhausted whisper] It's collapsing now, the whole frame. [more animated] Remember building that addition when Mary was born? [Ragged breath] Took us three months, and now it's gone in three minutes.
546  [sudden realization] Jake, we're outlaws now, you know that? [nervous laugh] Arson's a hanging offense in this county. [resigned] But I'd rather swing than live knowing they won in the end.
547  [growing distant] Time to ride, brother. [steadier] New Mexico, maybe California—somewhere they don't know our names. [wistful] Somewhere we can forget the sound of everything we loved turning to nothing.
548  [professionally] Let me pull up your account, 773-4429-B, one moment please. [surprised] Oh, that's... unusual. [clearing throat] It appears this fee was applied on October 23rd at exactly 3:33 AM, which is, well, outside our normal processing hours.
549  [more confused] Sir, I'm seeing these charges in our system but they're showing origin code ZX-99Q, which isn't—[hesitant]—which isn't actually in our fee schedule. [quietly] This shouldn't be possible.
550  [apologetically] Mr. Henderson, I need to escalate this immediately. [more firmly] These fee codes are appearing as "Department 7-Alpha" authorized, but we don't have a Department 7-Alpha. [nervous laugh] At least, not that I know of.
551  [very concerned] Sir, are you at 1842 Maple Street right now? [pause] Because our system shows you're simultaneously logged in from there and from coordinates that—[whispers]—that don't correspond to any known address.
552  [increasingly disturbed] Mr. Henderson, I'm going to—to transfer you to our specialized department. [very quietly] Please hold while I connect you to extension 0000. [long pause] They'll know what to do about the interdimensional fees.
553  [apologetic] I understand your frustration, sir, and I'm truly sorry about the delay. [speaking quickly] We're experiencing signal failures at the junction ahead, but our engineers are—they're working on it right now. [reassuringly] Should be resolved shortly.
554  [defensive] Sir, we operate thousands of services daily, and the vast majority run on time. [more firmly] Today's issue is, well, it's beyond our control—electrical equipment failed. [sighs] I can't make the trains move faster than safety allows.
555  [briskly] Current estimate is fifteen to twenty minutes, though I can't guarantee that timeframe. [more sympathetically] Look, I'll—I'll write you a delay certificate for your employer. [quickly] That should help explain the situation to them.
556  [patiently] The signal failure occurred after departure, sir—we couldn't have predicted it. [more firmly] If you'd like to file a formal complaint, there are forms at the station. [sighs quietly] But right now, I need to update other passengers.
557  [quickly] Sir, complaints are reviewed by management, and compensation is available for delays over thirty minutes. [more gently] I know it's frustrating—believe me, we don't enjoy this either. [tiredly] We're doing everything possible to get you moving.
558  [professionally] I've noted your concerns, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience. [more briskly] The delay certificate will be time-stamped, which should help your case. [firmly] We are genuinely sorry about your interview situation.
559  [sympathetically] I wish I could, but we don't have those arrangements for individual passengers. [speaking quickly] Once we arrive, station staff might—they might be able to suggest local taxi services. [gently] That's the best I can offer.
560  [calmly] Sir, I understand you're upset, but taking it out on me won't solve anything. [more firmly] I'm just doing my job here, trying to help everyone through this delay. [sighs] Please, let's keep this civil.
561  [encouragingly] Actually, I've just received word—we should be moving in the next five minutes. [speaking quickly] Signal's been partially restored, so we'll proceed at reduced speed. [more optimistically] You might still make your interview.
562  [honestly] We'll do our best to make up time where safely possible, but I can't promise anything. [more gently] What I can say is—we're priority cleared through the next three stations. [reassuringly] That should help considerably.
563  [Happy] Look, I know it sounds kinda scary, but that's exactly why you should—I mean, when else are you gonna get this chance? [Laugh]
564  [Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified the first time too, but then it was like... [Fast] everything just clicked, y'know?
565  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, just keep doing the same boring stuff forever—that sounds super fulfilling. [Tsk]
566  What if I told you that, um, literally everyone who's tried this has said it changed their perspective on—on everything, basically?
567  [Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I just thought you'd be more... adventurous than this, honestly.
568  [Shout] This is your chance to finally break out of that rut you're always complaining about! [Happy] Come on!
569  [Fast] Okay so here's the thing—it's only twenty minutes, it's completely safe, and if you hate it we can just—we'll leave immediately, alright?
570  [Sad] I really wanted us to, uh, to share this experience together, but I guess if you're not interested... [Sigh]
571  Remember when you made me try sushi and I was all weird about it?
572  [Angry] Stop making excuses—you're just, you're scared and you won't admit it! [Groan]
573  [Chuckle] The instructor is actually really cute, so there's that, I mean—not that it matters, but y'know...
574  [Slow] [Disappointed] Fine, I'll just... I'll go by myself then, I guess.
575  You're literally the one who said you wanted to be more spontaneous this year, right?
576  [Happy] Trust me, your Instagram is gonna look so good after this—wait, that came out wrong, but seriously! [Laugh]
577  [Sarcastic] Yeah, because sitting on your couch watching Netflix for the fifth weekend in a row is working out great for you. [Tsk]
578  [Whisper] I already kinda signed us both up, so... [Fast] please don't be mad but the deposit was non-refundable!
579  [Sad] [Sigh] It's just—I dunno, I thought you'd at least consider it before shooting it down completely.
580  What's the absolute worst thing that could happen—like really, actually think about it for a second?
581  [Angry] [Shout] Would you just stop overthinking everything for once in your life?!
582  [Slow] Sometimes the best things in life are the ones that, um, that terrify you a little bit first, y'know? [Chuckle]
583  [frustrated] Oh my God, don't even get me started on today. I had to drive downtown for that meeting, right? And I'm circling around for like— I'm not even kidding, like twenty minutes just looking for a stupid parking spot. [increasingly agitated] Every single street, just full. And you know how those meters are like three dollars an hour now? [scoff] So I'm getting more and more stressed because I'm gonna be late and I'm gonna have to pay like a fortune just to park. [exasperated] I literally drove past the same like, I don't know, hot dog cart guy like four times. He probably thought I was stalking him or something. [groan] And I'm sweating because my AC is busted and I'm just getting so— [surprised] Wait, hold on. Someone's— oh my God, someone's literally walking to their car right now. Right in front of where I need to be. [amazed] [relieved] They're pulling out! Like, this never happens to me, ever. I have the worst parking luck in the world usually, and this guy is just— he's just leaving, right when I need it most. [happy] [slightly incredulous] I swear it was like the universe finally decided to cut me some slack. [laugh] Went from wanting to scream to feeling like I won the lottery in like two seconds.
584  I—okay, yeah, I did, but I was literally losing my mind trying to help you and I didn't know what else to do. You were spiraling and I just—I needed advice from someone who actually knows you.
585  Maybe not, but like—come on, you weren't talking to anyone else about it. You were just sitting on this huge thing and I could see it was eating you alive. I'm not saying I handled it perfectly, but I was trying to help.
586  That's not—[frustrated laugh] okay, that's not fair. I didn't break your trust, I was trying to figure out how to support you better. Marcus has been through the same thing with his parents, y'know? I thought maybe he'd have some perspective that I didn't.
587  Could I? Because every time I brought it up, you just—you shut down completely. And I get it, I do, but you can't expect me to just watch you struggle and not try to find ways to help. That's not how friendship works.
588  No, no, no—that's not what this is. I wasn't deciding anything for you. I was literally just asking Marcus if he had any advice on how to be there for you. Like, that's it. [sigh] I didn't give him every detail or whatever you're imagining.
589  Just that—that your parents were getting divorced and you were having a hard time with it. That's it. I didn't get into the messy stuff or the—y'know, the personal details you told me. I kept it super basic because I just needed to know how to help.
590  Okay, fine, maybe—maybe it was. But honestly? You're acting like I gossiped about you for fun or something. I was scared for you. You weren't eating, you were barely sleeping, and I didn't—I didn't know what to do.
591  I went to our mutual best friend who's been through the exact same thing. And yeah, okay, I should've asked you first, but you weren't exactly being reasonable about anything at that point. You were just—you were drowning and I was trying to throw you a life raft.
592  Right, because drowning people are always super logical about accepting help. [scoff] Look, I'm sorry I didn't handle it the way you wanted, okay? But I'm not gonna apologize for caring about you or trying to find ways to support you when you clearly needed it.
593  And you don't get to—to shut everyone out and then be mad when people who love you try to figure out how to be there for you anyway. That's not—I mean, come on, that's not realistic. I'm human, I make mistakes, but this wasn't me being malicious. This was me being worried about my best friend.
594  [muttering] Okay, so I just need to, um— I just need to thread this needle and then I can, uh, I can fix this button. How hard can it be, right? I mean, people have been doing this for, like, literally thousands of years. [slightly strained] Alright, so I just— [exhale] I just need to get the thread through the, um, through the little hole. The eye. That's what it's called, the eye. Okay, so let me just— let me just line it up and— [frustrated] No, that's not— that's not going in. Maybe if I, uh, if I lick the thread? Does that help? I feel like my mom used to do that. Or maybe I'm thinking of, um, of stamps? [laugh] God, when's the last time I used a stamp? [concentrating] Focus. Okay. Let me just— let me just hold it up to the light and— oh, wait, I think I can see it better if I, um, if I squint a little? That seems backwards but— [triumphant] Oh! There we go! It went through! [sigh] Okay, cool, I'm not completely useless with my hands. I was starting to wonder there for a, uh, for a second.
595  [gruff] So, Tyler, your mother tells me you're still living in the city. [slower] Must be expensive with all those... [pause] [dismissively] fancy coffee shops and liberal types running around everywhere these days.
596  [suspicious tone] Accept you? [scoff] What's that supposed to mean? [increasingly agitated] In my day, we didn't need special acceptance groups—we just acted normal and got along fine without all this nonsense.
597  [sputtering] His? HIS? [louder] You're telling me you brought some man to your mother's house? [harsh whisper] What would your grandfather think if he were alive to see this disaster?
598  [bitterly] Don't you quote my father at me! [growling] He was from a different generation—he wouldn't understand all this [pause] [disgusted] modern confusion about what's right and what's completely backwards.
599  [defensively] I'm not judging, I'm just saying it's not natural! [frustrated grunt] [quieter] Look, Tyler, I worry about you—this lifestyle, it's [trailing off] difficult and people will always stare and whisper.
600  [uncomfortably] That was completely different! [pause] [mumbling] Maria and I, we were... [sigh] [quietly] We loved each other despite what the neighbors said about mixing cultures.
601  [long exhale] [reluctantly] Your boyfriend... Marcus... [hesitant] does he at least have a decent job? [grumbling] Not some artist or dancer or whatever stereotypes I'm supposed to expect here.
602  [surprised grunt] [defensive] Well, good for him then. [pause] [awkwardly formal] And I suppose you expect me to shake his hand at Christmas if your mother invites him to family gatherings?
603  [clearing throat] [stiffly] Well, don't get all emotional about it. [pause] [barely audible] Maybe I could meet him, just briefly— [quickly] but no public displays or whatever you kids do.
604  [perking up] Cowboys fan? [suspicious again] You're not just saying that to butter me up? [pause] [considering] I suppose someone who appreciates good football can't be [mumbled] completely terrible, even if...
605  [calmly] I understand you're upset, sir. [professionally] Let me pull up your account—can you confirm your service number? [sympathetically] We'll definitely look into this incident right away.
606  [defensively] Sir, our records show the service was completed at 7:43 AM this morning. [more firmly] Our drivers are trained professionals, and, well... [hesitant] sometimes pre-existing damage can appear worse after snow removal.
607  [apologetically] That won't be necessary—I mean, we can file a claim. [sighs] You'll need form DR-66 and, um, three estimates from licensed contractors. [quietly] The process usually takes 6-8 weeks.
608  [more sympathetically] I can escalate this to our damage department, reference number D-2024-8847. [reassuringly] However, they're... they're currently reviewing 47 other claims. [cautiously] Would a temporary credit of $50 help while we investigate?
609  [nervously] Mr. Thompson is, uh, in meetings until Thursday. [more confidently] But I can offer our expedited review for priority members—are you Silver level or Gold? [hopefully] Gold members get 72-hour resolution guarantees.
610  [professionally] I'm scheduling Supervisor Jenkins for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. [warmly] He'll assess everything and, if our driver's at fault... [trailing off] we'll make it right, I promise.
611  [apologetically] The system only allows four-hour blocks, unfortunately. [helpfully] But Jenkins usually texts 30 minutes ahead—make sure number ending in 7749 is correct? [optimistically] He's very thorough with his assessments.
612  [surprised] Multiple properties? [concerned] Oh, that's... that changes things significantly. [quickly] They'll each need to file separate claims using reference code M-PLT-2024. [nervously] This might go to corporate review.
613  [panicked] Sir, that's really not necessary! [pleading] Let me connect you directly to our Regional Damage Specialist—extension 5590. [reassuringly] She has authority to approve immediate repairs up to $5,000.
614  [relieved] I'm transferring you now, and I've noted everything in ticket RT-44526. [confidently] The specialist can authorize the full amount, and yes... [quietly] driver reassignment is definitely possible. [warmly] Thank you for your patience, Mr. Peterson.
615  [firmly] Mr. Johnson, I understand your concerns about the inspection report. [clears throat] However, I need you to understand that what we documented is, well, it's based on industry standards and [more defensively] visual evidence collected on-site.
616  [calmly] Sir, the staining patterns on the concrete indicate... [pause] Look, moisture meters don't lie. [more quickly] We recorded thirty-two percent humidity in the northeast corner, which significantly exceeds normal parameters for residential basements.
617  [briskly] Our equipment is calibrated monthly, sir, and yes, we noted the dehumidifier's presence. [sighs] The issue is—how do I put this—the foundation cracks behind your storage shelves are allowing moisture ingress regardless.
618  [quickly] The hairline fractures are documented in photos seventeen through twenty-three of your report appendix. [more patiently] They're subtle, I'll grant you that, but they're definitely structural concerns that need addressing.
619  [defensively] Sir, exposed junction boxes and aluminum wiring aren't minor issues—they're fire hazards. [more urgently] We're talking about safety here, not just, um, not just cosmetic problems that can be painted over.
620  [steadily] Building codes have evolved significantly since your last inspection, Mr. Johnson. [sighs heavily] What passed five years ago might not... [more quickly] Look, these aren't arbitrary rules we're inventing to sabotage your sale.
621  [briskly] We inspect what we see, not what paperwork claims. [more firmly] Those shingles show significant granular loss, curling edges, and—let me check here—three areas of active deterioration near the chimney flashing.
622  [apologetically] I understand this is stressful, truly. [pause] But we have liability if we miss something significant. [more quickly] Would you prefer we schedule a reinspection with you present to go through each item together?
623  [quickly] Actually, sir, the reinspection would be complementary given your concerns. [more reassuringly] We want you to feel confident in our findings, not... not ambushed by them on selling day.
624  [professionally] That's perfectly acceptable, Mr. Johnson. [briskly] How's Thursday at nine? We'll bring the thermal imaging camera too, so you can actually see the temperature differentials we're concerned about.
625  [Nervous] I keep thinking someone's gonna, like, tap me on the shoulder and say "Hey, we made a mistake hiring you." [Sigh]
626  [Whisper] Everyone in this meeting sounds so smart and I'm just—I'm literally googling terms under the table right now. [Fast] Don't look at my screen.
627  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, they definitely meant to promote me, not the other Sarah from accounting. [Tsk] [Disappointed] This has gotta be some kind of mix-up.
628  [Angry] Why did I even open my mouth in there—god, I probably sounded like a complete idiot! [Groan]
629  [Happy] Wait, my boss actually liked my presentation? [Laugh] I mean, I stayed up all night because I thought it was garbage!
630  [Slow] Sometimes I just sit at my desk and wonder how long until they figure out I'm, um, basically winging it every single day.
631  [Sad] My colleague has like fifteen years experience and here I am, pretending I know what a pivot table even—actually, I should probably learn that. [Sigh]
632  [Fast] [Shout] I got the award! I got the—wait, are you sure this envelope has the right name on it?
633  [Whisper] [Chuckle] I've been nodding along to acronyms all week that I, uh, honestly have zero clue what they mean.
634  [Disappointed] They're all Ivy League and I'm just—I mean, my degree's from a state school nobody's heard of, so... [Tsk]
635  [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, because clearly I'm qualified to lead this project with my extensive experience of, oh wait, literally none.
636  [Happy] You know what, maybe I'm not completely terrible at this job—I did fix that thing yesterday! [Laugh] [Fast] Okay, IT helped, but still!
637  [Angry] [Slow] I can't keep comparing myself to—ugh, Jessica started the same day and she's already running meetings.
638  [Sad] Do you ever feel like you're just... playing dress-up in your dad's suit, pretending to be a grown-up? [Sigh] [Whisper] Because I do.
639  [Shout] Stop saying I deserve this promotion! [Disappointed] I literally just learned how to use the coffee machine last week!
640  [Chuckle] My LinkedIn says "expert" but honestly I'm more like, um, "person who's really good at looking confident while panicking."
641  [Fast] [Angry] I spent three hours on that email because I kept thinking—what if they realize I don't actually know what I'm talking about?
642  [Slow] [Sarcastic] Oh great, another team lunch where I get to pretend I understand everyone's inside jokes about, er, whatever happened before I got here.
643  [Whisper] Sometimes when my boss compliments me, I kinda wanna ask "Are you sure you're talking about me?" [Tsk] [Sad] But that'd be weird, right?
644  [Happy] [Fast] My coworker just asked ME for advice—wait, they're asking me? [Laugh] I mean, sure, I'll totally help, but like, wow.
645  [frustrated] Ugh, so my car is like— it's literally falling apart on me. There's this leak, like water just pooling on the passenger side floor, and I have no idea where it's coming from. [annoyed] I'm talking like, soaking wet. I put my bag down this morning and it's just— [groan] it's sitting in this puddle. My laptop bag! Like that's exactly what I need right now, you know? [worried] And of course this happens right when I'm already broke from rent being due. I'm thinking it's gonna be like the roof or the windshield seal or something expensive and— God, I can't afford a big repair right now. [frustrated] I've been driving around with towels on the floor like some kind of— I don't know, like my car's wearing a diaper or something. It's so embarrassing. [realizing] [quieter] Wait, actually... hold on. I'm thinking about this and— when did this start? Because I think it was like... right when it got hot and I started using the AC again? [dawning understanding] [slightly embarrassed] Oh my God. Oh my— [half laugh] I think it might just be condensation. From the air conditioning. That's like... that's totally normal, isn't it? [relieved] [laughing] I'm such an idiot! I've been freaking out about my car dying and it's just— it's just doing what cars do. [chuckle] Crisis averted, I guess.
646  Wait wait wait—what? The one you auditioned for like, last month? Oh my god, I thought you said it was a long shot! This is—this is huge!
647  Next WEEK? Okay, um, why are you being so casual about this? [Laugh] Like, you're literally gonna be in a movie! What's your role? Is it the—was it the one you wanted?
648  The sister! Yes! I remember you talking about her, she had that whole like, complicated backstory thing, right? With the—wait, doesn't she have all those emotional scenes?
649  Oh. Oh no, okay but—but they cast you, right? So obviously they think you can do it. Maybe they'll use like, fake tears or something? I dunno how that works honestly.
650  Are you—hold on, are you actually nervous? Because that's so normal, like completely completely normal. I'd be [Groan] terrified probably. But also excited? Are you excited at all?
651  Different how? Like, good different or... oh god, you're not gonna back out are you? Because this is—I mean, this is kinda what you've been working toward forever.
652  Okay no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You got cast for a reason, they saw like, hundreds of people probably and they picked YOU. [Softer] That means something, y'know?
653  Oh man, of course they—ugh, sorry, that's frustrating. But like, can you do both? The filming schedule, is it gonna conflict with work?
654  Three weeks of—okay yeah, that's... that's actually brutal. But also? Kinda badass that you're gonna do it anyway. Have you told anyone else yet or am I like, the first to know? [Laugh]
655  Wait, really? I'm—oh my god, I'm so honored. Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating this weekend, and I don't wanna hear any of your "it's not a big deal" stuff because it absolutely is.
656  Oh! Um, which—wait, are you talking about the one from last night? I thought it was cute! You looked so happy and I just wanted to—oh no. Oh no no no, you're mad.
657  I didn't—I mean, I didn't think it was that big of a deal? Like, it was just you at the party and—[nervous laugh] okay yeah, I can see your face right now and I'm realizing I really messed up.
658  Oh god. Oh my god, I didn't even—I wasn't thinking about that. I just, you know how I get when I post, I just kinda autopilot and tag everyone and—shit, did your boss see it?
659  I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. I can take it down! I'll take it down right now, hold on, let me just— [groan] Okay it's gone. It's deleted.
660  I know, I know, but maybe—maybe we can tell them you were on lunch? Or that it was an old photo? I mean, technically you were gonna leave work early anyway, right? That's what you told me—not that that makes it okay! I'm not saying it's okay.
661  Wait, your family? But I thought—oh. Oh no, was this the day you told them you were visiting your aunt? I—god, I really just ruined everything, didn't I? I'm such an idiot sometimes, I swear I don't think before I—
662  Okay, fine, a lot of the time. Most of the time? I just get excited and wanna share stuff and I forget that not everyone—that's not an excuse though. I should've asked you first. I always forget to ask.
663  You're right. You're—you're completely right and I hate that about myself, honestly. Like my mom says the same thing and usually I just brush it off but [sigh] when it hurts people I care about—when it hurts you—I just feel like garbage.
664  I know. Remember the group chat thing? And the—the birthday surprise I ruined? God, why do you even keep me around? I'm basically a walking disaster who can't keep her mouth shut, online or offline.
665  I am. I'm your friend who's gonna—who's gonna do better, I promise. Like, actually promise this time. Maybe you could, um, maybe check my posts before I hit send? Like a filter? I dunno, whatever helps. I just—I really don't wanna lose you over my stupid social media habits.
666  I—okay, wait, that's not exactly how it went down. I was trying to figure out if you wanted me to jump in or if that would've made things worse with your mom.
667  Yeah, and I didn't know what that meant! Was it like "help me" or "please don't make this worse"? You know how your family gets when outsiders—when other people get involved. [Sigh] I've seen it happen before.
668  That's—no, that's not fair. I tried to change the subject like three times. I literally brought up the weather, which was super awkward, but I was trying to give you an out without overstepping.
669  I know, I know, and that sucked to watch, honestly it did. But you're acting like I—look, last time I defended you to your dad, you told me afterwards that I made everything ten times worse, remember?
670  How? How was it different? Because from where I'm sitting, it's like—I can't win here. [frustrated laugh] Either I'm overstepping or I'm not doing enough, and I never know which one you want until after.
671  In front of your whole family? Like, "Hey, excuse me everyone, should I defend my friend right now?" Come on. That would've been—you know that would've been weird.
672  Okay okay, that's—I didn't abandon you. That word is kinda harsh, don't you think? I was literally sitting right there, trying to figure out how to help without making your mom go completely nuclear on both of us.
673  And you're mine, which is why I—ugh, this is so frustrating. I'm sorry I didn't handle it perfectly, alright? But I was genuinely trying not to make your situation worse. That's gotta count for something.
674  I mean... yeah? I think it should? Look look, I get that you're hurt, and maybe I should've—I dunno, done something different. [Scoff] But you're not even acknowledging that I was in an impossible position here.
675  And I was there! Just not—not in the exact way you wanted, apparently. But I was there, and I'm here now, even though you're basically treating me like I'm the enemy when your family's the one who—whatever. This is exhausting.
676  That's not—okay, that's literally not true. I don't always have to be right, I just... when I know something, I say it. There's a difference.
677  Seriously? You're gonna make me—fine, remember last month when we were arguing about that movie thing? I said you were right about the director. [scoff] But apparently that doesn't count now.
678  So what? I still admitted it, didn't I? Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here, but like... if I think something's true, I'm gonna say it. That's not me being stubborn, that's just—that's just being honest.
679  Okay okay, but you're acting like I do this to annoy you on purpose. I don't! I genuinely—when I say something, it's because I believe it's right. Would you rather I just... pretend to be wrong when I'm not?
680  That's—wow. [frustrated laugh] So you want me to lie? Just nod along and agree with everything even when I know it's not accurate? That's not who I am, y'know?
681  And I get that, I do, but you're making it sound like I turn everything into an argument when really I'm just—I'm trying to help. Like, if you're wrong about something, wouldn't you wanna know?
682  That's... that's actually really hurtful. Look look, I know I can be—intense or whatever, but I'm not doing it to make you feel stupid. That's never been the point.
683  Well it's not, okay? It's not. And honestly? You're kinda doing the same thing right now—deciding you're right about my intentions without even listening to what I'm saying.
684  How? How is it different? Because from where I'm sitting, you've already decided I'm this horrible person who has to win every argument, and nothing I say is gonna change your mind. [sigh] Which is pretty ironic if you think about it.
685  And I—I am your friend. Or I'm trying to be. But I can't just turn off my brain, y'know? I can't pretend not to know things. Maybe that makes me annoying, but it's also just... me.
686  Oh. Oh no. Wait wait wait, that wasn't—okay I know how it looked but I swear it wasn't what you think. We were just talking about the project and then—I mean, yeah, we were laughing but that's just—
687  I was? I—okay maybe I was but like, you know how I am, right? I'm just naturally touchy with everyone and I didn't even realize—[nervous laugh] god, I'm such an idiot. I wasn't thinking about it like that at all.
688  I know. I know I knew, and that's—that's the worst part. I just got caught up in the conversation and honestly, Alex was being really funny and I kinda forgot to—no, that sounds terrible. I didn't forget, I just wasn't being careful enough.
689  No no no, not like—I didn't mean it like that. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I absolutely was not trying to flirt with them. Like, I have zero interest in Alex that way, I promise you.
690  Wait, what? What do you mean? Did they—did they say something to you? Oh god, if they think I was hitting on them—okay this is bad. This is really really bad and I'm gonna fix it, I swear.
691  I'll talk to them! I'll—I'll make it super clear that I'm not interested and actually, y'know what? I'll tell them how amazing you are. Like casually drop it into conversation that you're—wait, is that weird? That might be weird. But I wanna help somehow.
692  You're right. You're totally right. I should just—I should back off completely, shouldn't I? [sigh] God, I really messed this up for you. I'm so so sorry. I never wanted to get in the way of—of whatever could happen between you two.
693  You were? Oh man, you still should! Honestly, you really really should because I don't think—look, from what I could tell, Alex seems pretty interested in you too. They kept asking about you actually, which I probably should've mentioned earlier but—
694  Yeah! Like multiple times! They wanted to know what kinda music you're into and if you were dating anyone and—oh my god, I'm literally the worst friend ever for not putting two and two together. They were totally fishing for info about you.
695  Because I'm an idiot? Because I was too busy being my usual chatty self to realize what was happening? I dunno, I just—[nervous laugh] I guess I was so worried about looking like I was flirting that I didn't notice they were basically interviewing me about you. Still gonna ask them out?
696  [muttering] Oh, come on. Come on, where is— I know I have it somewhere. The, um, the little card thing for— [sigh] I literally just need the stupid loyalty card and I— wait, did I even bring my wallet? [slightly panicked] Okay, okay, wallet's here, that's good. But the card is— it's not in the, uh, it's not in the little slot where I usually— [groan] Oh no. Oh no no no, I think I left it on the kitchen counter. [resigned but still searching] Maybe it's loose in here somewhere? Like, maybe it just, um, maybe it fell out or something? Let me just— no, that's a receipt. That's another receipt. Why do I have so many— [tsk] this is just grocery receipts from like three weeks ago. [defeated] Yeah, no, it's definitely at home. Sitting right there on the counter next to the, uh, next to the coffee maker where I left it like an idiot. [exhale] Great planning, really. [brightening slightly] But wait, can't I just, um— don't they have like an app now? Or I could just give them my phone number, right? That's— that's a thing they do now.
697  [trembling voice] I keep thinking this isn't real, that tomorrow you'll still be here. [Shaky breath] We've been through everything together since we were kids, and now [voice breaking] I don't know how to do this without you.
698  [bitter laugh] Summer camp didn't involve bullets and bombs. [more desperately] What if something happens and I never get to tell you how much you mean to me? [Choked sob] What if our last conversation is about something stupid?
699  [through tears] Remember the treehouse? [nostalgic whisper] We swore we'd live there forever, just the two of us against the world. [Sniffling] Sometimes I wish we could go back to being eight and believing that was actually possible.
700  [suddenly urgent] Promise me you'll write. [rapid words] Real letters, not just emails—something I can hold when everything feels too empty here. [pleading] Even if it's just one line saying you're okay, that you're still you.
701  [angry suddenly] This is so unfair! [louder] Why does it have to be you? There are millions of people in this country. [Breaking down] But no, my best friend has to be the hero. [Bitter sob] I hate this.
702  [hollow whisper] Your mom made me promise to look after your dog. [trying to smile] Like I wouldn't have stolen him anyway. [voice wobbling] He's going to sleep on your pillow every night until you come back to claim him properly.
703  [desperate] What if you change? [faster] What if the person who comes back isn't the one who left? [Ragged breath] What if we can't find our way back to this, to us, to everything we've built together here?
704  [exhausted] I brought you something. [rustling sounds] It's stupid, just that keychain from the arcade—[voice lifting] remember when we spent forty dollars trying to win it? [Soft laugh] Figured you could use some good luck from our misspent youth.
705  [suddenly clear] When you come back, we're taking that road trip. [building energy] No excuses, no delays—straight to the coast like we always planned. [fiercely] Two weeks of terrible music and gas station coffee, and absolutely no talk about any of this.
706  [breaking completely] I love you, you know that right? [through sobs] Not romantically, just—you're my person, my family. [gasping] The thought of this world without you in it makes me feel like I'm drowning in advance.
707  [shouting] What do you mean my daughter has a broken arm?! [voice cracking] I dropped her off at 8:15 this morning perfectly fine, and now you're telling me she's at—at Memorial Hospital on 2847 Oak Street?!
708  [furiously] The playground equipment? [louder] Which one exactly, because I specifically filled out form 23-B stating she wasn't allowed on the climbing tower! [voice trembling] This is completely unacceptable!
709  [incredulous] Backwards?! [shouting] Where was the supervision? [sarcastically] Don't I pay $1,850 a month for you people to actually watch these kids?
710  [voice breaking] Don't give me that! [more angrily] I want to see the security footage from cameras 3 and 4 in the playground area. [demanding] And I want copies of every single staff certification by tomorrow morning!
711  [bitterly] Oh, how convenient, more paperwork! [louder] My four-year-old is in the hospital with a fractured radius, and you're worried about—about protocols? [scoffs] This is lawsuit material, you understand that?
712  [quieter] I'm already in my car, doing 75 on Interstate 405! [voice shaking] But don't think this conversation is over. [firmly] I want a meeting with the director Monday at 9 AM sharp!
713  [sarcastically] Your best wishes? [louder] That's really helpful right now! [sighs heavily] Just have all the documentation ready, including Teacher Rodriguez's file and that other child's information.
714  [frustrated] Privacy laws! [groans] My baby is hurt and you're protecting the kid who caused this? [more controlled] Fine, but I want the parents contacted—room 4B, the Mitchell boy, right?
715  [exhausted] You have no idea. [voice cracking] She's four years old, she was so excited about show-and-tell today, brought her—her favorite stuffed unicorn. [sniffling] Now she's getting X-rays instead.
716  [softer] She did? [sighs] That sounds like my Emma. [more firmly] Look, I'm pulling into the hospital now, parking garage level C-3. [determined] But this isn't over, not by a long shot.
717  [professionally] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your recent premium notice. [quickly] Yes, I can definitely help explain the increase—let me just pull up your account here and, um, we can go through everything together.
718  [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, truly. [more quickly] The increase is actually market-wide—we've seen rising repair costs, medical expenses are up thirty percent, and [pause] unfortunately these factors affect everyone's rates.
719  [gently] You're absolutely right, everything's more expensive now. [briskly] Let me check what discounts we can apply—are you still, um, working from home? [hopeful] We have new low-mileage options that could save you fifteen percent.
720  [quickly] Actually, three days qualifies you for our hybrid work discount! [more enthusiastically] Plus, if you bundle with homeowners—wait, do you have that with us? [pause] We could potentially get you back closer to your original rate.
721  [reassuringly] It's actually much easier than you'd think! [rapidly] We handle all the paperwork, coordinate the switch date, and—here's the thing—bundling would save you about [calculating] two hundred monthly across both policies.
722  [firmly] No catch, same coverage levels exactly. [more slowly] The savings come from the multi-policy discount, plus that hybrid work reduction, and [quickly] honestly, we really value long-term customers like yourself.
723  [confidently] No long-term contracts whatsoever! [briskly] You can adjust or cancel anytime—we keep customers by, you know, actually providing value. [chuckles lightly] Not by trapping them with contracts.
724  [efficiently] Absolutely, I'm preparing that right now actually. [quickly] I'll include both the standalone auto rate and the bundled option, with all applicable discounts itemized—should be in your inbox within five minutes.
725  [enthusiastically] Perfect timing to ask! [rapidly] We have a good student discount, defensive driving course credits, and if she's using a car with our safe-drive monitoring app, that's another [calculating] ten to fifteen percent off her portion.
726  [diplomatically] I understand the concern about privacy, really. [more reassuringly] The app only tracks driving behaviors—speed, braking, that sort of thing—not locations or destinations. [quickly] It's completely optional but the savings are substantial.
727  [Slow] I'm just gonna, um, close my eyes for like one second—just to rest them, you know? [Yawn] Not sleeping, definitely not sleeping.
728  [Fast] Wait, who's that guy again? [Confused] Is he the—no, that's the other one, right?
729  [Whisper] If I fall asleep, just, uh, elbow me or something, okay? [Chuckle] But like, gently.
730  [Angry] This movie is so damn slow—I mean, honestly, when does something actually happen? [Groan]
731  [Happy] Oh! Oh, this is the good part! [Fast] I'm awake, I'm totally awake now!
732  [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm riveted by this, uh, ten-minute establishing shot of a building. [Tsk]
733  Maybe I should get some—actually, you know what, I'm gonna grab another coffee real quick.
734  [Disappointed] I really wanted to like this one, but it's just... [Sigh] it's kind of a slog, isn't it?
735  [Shout] What?! [Fast] No way, I wasn't sleeping—I was just, um, resting my neck!
736  [Slow] The cinematography is really... really beautiful though, I guess. [Yawn] Very... artistic.
737  How much longer is this thing anyway—like, are we halfway through or...?
738  [Sad] I'm sorry, I know you were excited about this one, but I'm just—I'm struggling here. [Sigh]
739  [Fast] [Laugh] Did I just snore? Please tell me I didn't just snore in the theater!
740  [Whisper] [Slow] Everything feels so heavy right now, like my eyelids weigh a thousand pounds or something.
741  I'm gonna try that thing where you, uh, pinch yourself—does that actually work? [Groan]
742  [Happy] [Chuckle] You know what, let's just make fun of it—that'll keep me entertained at least!
743  [Sarcastic] [Disappointed] Great, another dream sequence—or wait, is this real? I honestly can't tell anymore.
744  [Angry] [Fast] Why do they keep the theater so warm and cozy? It's like they want people to pass out!
745  This popcorn is literally the only thing keeping me conscious right now. [Chuckle]
746  [Sad] [Whisper] I feel so bad, but I just—I cannot follow what's happening anymore, my brain is like, completely gone.
747  [casual] So I took that back route through downtown today, you know the one that cuts behind the mall? Saved me like ten minutes, which was great because I was already running late for my appointment. [matter-of-fact] There was this one intersection where I had to gun it a little bit because the light was changing, but whatever, that happens. Traffic was moving, I was moving with it. [slight concern] Actually, now that I think about it... [pause] there was this camera thing at that intersection. One of those big flash camera setups? I remember seeing it as I went through. [a bit worried] Wait, was that light yellow or red when I went under it? I mean, I thought it was yellow, but I was focused on the car in front of me, and— [nervous laugh] oh god, what if it was red? [increasingly anxious] Those cameras are like, super sensitive, right? They'll ticket you for being in the intersection even if you're just— [sharp exhale] I can't afford a red light ticket right now. Those are like three hundred dollars! [spiraling] [panicked] Oh my god, what if there's already a ticket in the mail? What if it's sitting in my mailbox right now? [groan] I'm never taking shortcuts again. Never! Why did I think— [whimper] I'm gonna be checking my mail obsessively for the next two weeks!
748  Wait wait wait—what letter? What's official? Oh my god, is this—is this what I think it is?
749  SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up! Are you—oh my god, are you serious right now? [Gasp] This is huge! This is like, this is literally everything!
750  Seven—okay, that's actually insane. Like, seven years of just... waiting and paperwork and probably, I dunno, stress eating? How are you so calm about this?
751  No no no, I get that. It's probably like—honestly? It probably doesn't even feel real yet, right? When's the ceremony thing?
752  An oath! That's so—wait, that's kinda intense actually. [Chuckle] Like what, you gotta pledge allegiance and stuff? Is it long?
753  Oh wow, they're—that's amazing! They must be like, completely losing their minds proud right now. Your mom's probably already told everyone she knows.
754  Okay that's—that's actually really sweet though. I mean, twenty minutes is [Laugh] a lot, but like... this is everything they wanted for you, y'know?
755  Weird how? Like—wait, are you nervous about it or is it more like... I dunno, complicated feelings about the whole citizenship thing?
756  That's—honestly that makes total sense. It's like, you're gaining something but also kinda... not losing, but changing something? About who you are? That's gotta be heavy.
757  Well hey, for what it's worth? I'm like—I'm really, really proud of you. Seven years is... [Sigh] that's a long time to fight for something. You did it though.
758  Oh—oh no, what jokes? Wait, do you mean the thing from yesterday? Because I was just trying to be funny and—actually, that's not an excuse, I shouldn't have—
759  The height thing. Right. God, I'm—I'm such an idiot. [nervous laugh] I didn't think it was bothering you that much because you were laughing too, y'know? But that's—that's not really an excuse either.
760  You weren't—oh. Oh shit. I thought... okay no, you're right, I should've noticed. I just get carried away sometimes when everyone's joking around and I don't—I don't always think before I speak.
761  Wait wait wait, there's more? What else did I—oh god, the thing about your voice? When you were presenting? I meant it as like a lighthearted—but that's terrible, isn't it? I'm literally the worst friend. [groan]
762  I know, I know. You're right. It's like—it's become this stupid habit and I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time? But that's my problem, not yours, and I shouldn't be making you feel bad about yourself. That's so messed up.
763  No! No no no, absolutely not! I think you're—you're amazing, honestly. I think I just... sometimes when I'm nervous or trying to be funny, I go for the easy joke? And I pick on people I'm comfortable with, which is so backwards and stupid—
764  That's not—okay, yeah, hearing it like that... [sigh] That sounds awful. I meant comfortable like I feel close to you, but I'm using that closeness in completely the wrong way. Like, I would never make those jokes about someone I didn't know well, which makes this worse, doesn't it?
765  I'm gonna—I'm gonna stop. Completely. No more jokes about anything personal, I swear. And if I slip up, you can literally just tell me to shut up, okay? I mean it. I don't wanna be that person who makes their friends feel shitty about themselves.
766  I mean... maybe part of me kinda knew? Like, looking back, you did get quiet sometimes. But I just—I dunno, I convinced myself it was fine because we're friends and friends tease each other, right? But there's teasing and then there's being an actual jerk, and I crossed that line.
767  No, don't—you shouldn't have to tell me not to be mean about your insecurities. That's like, basic friendship stuff. But I'm really, really glad you're telling me now. And I'm sorry it took you having to confront me about it. I wanna do better. I will do better.
768  Wait wait wait—approved? Like, approved approved? Oh my god, you're gonna be a foster parent! This is—I mean, how are you even feeling right now?
769  Oh honey, yeah, no that's—that's totally normal though. Like, you're literally about to change a kid's whole life, y'know? When do they, um, when do they place someone with you?
770  That's so—okay that's kinda wild actually. Like you just... wait? By the phone? [Nervous laugh] God, I'd be going absolutely insane not knowing.
771  Stop, that's actually—that's really sweet though. You're already being such a parent! Have you like, bought stuff? Or do you wait until you know their age and everything?
772  Right right, because you don't—I mean, could be a five-year-old, could be a teenager... [Sigh] This is huge. Like, this is what you've wanted for so long.
773  Three years, jesus. And all those home visits and background checks and—ugh, I remember when they interviewed ME about you. I was so nervous I'd say something wrong.
774  I did not—okay fine, maybe a little! But like, they asked why you'd be a good parent and I just... started thinking about how much you've wanted this, y'know?
775  No no no, don't—don't even go there. You're gonna be incredible. These kids, they need someone stable, someone who actually gives a damn. That's literally you.
776  Then you just... keep showing up anyway? [Soft chuckle] That's kinda the whole thing, right? Being there even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard, actually.
777  See? That's—oh my god, that's exactly what I mean. You're already thinking about making them feel safe. You're gonna be so, so good at this.
778  [muttering] Okay, so I just need to, um— I need to put some money in this thing and then I can— [sigh] oh. Oh, it's one of those old ones. The, uh, the coin ones. [slightly annoyed] Right, because of course it is. Of course I find the one parking meter in the entire city that doesn't take, um, that doesn't take cards or— or whatever. Just coins. Like it's 1987 or something. [rummaging tone] Okay, let me just— let me check my, uh, my wallet here. Maybe I have some— some quarters? Do I ever have quarters? I feel like I never have quarters when I actually need them. [frustrated but resigned] Thirty-seven cents. I have thirty-seven cents in, um, in random change and I need— what do I need, like a dollar? A dollar fifty? This is— this is great. This is just great. [brightening slightly] Wait, actually, maybe— maybe there's a, uh, there's probably a store or something around here that can break a twenty? I mean, that's a thing, right? People still do that? [trailing off, uncertain] Unless I just... risk it? How often do they actually check these things anyway...
779  [hesitant] I didn't think you'd come. [clearing throat] It's been what—seven years? [softer] Mom keeps asking for you though, even with the morphine, she mumbles your name between the beeps of these machines.
780  [exhausted sigh] The doctors say maybe days. [trembling] Her liver's completely shot—all those years of drinking finally caught up. [accusatory] Where were you when I was cleaning up her vomit at three in the morning?
781  [through tears] Someone had to take care of her. [sharper] You just ran away to California the second things got hard. [wavering] Dad would've been so disappointed seeing us like this, standing here arguing.
782  [shocked whisper] He never said that. [building anger] You're making things up again, just like when we were kids. [broken voice] God, even now, even here, you're trying to rewrite history to make yourself feel better.
783  [soft laugh] She'd make those elaborate French braids. [wistful] You always got the pink ribbons; I got blue. [cracking voice] I found a box of those ribbons last week while cleaning out her apartment.
784  [sniffling] What would we even say? [sardonic] Hey Mom, your daughters finally stopped hating each other long enough to watch you die? [quieter] She probably can't even hear us through all the medications anyway.
785  [joining in] We love you, Mom. [steadier] And we forgive you—for all of it. [breath catching] The missed recitals, the forgotten birthdays, the promises you couldn't keep. We understand now that you were sick.
786  [disbelief] Her eyes are fluttering. [louder] Mom? Mom, can you see us? [desperately hopeful] Both your girls are here, just like you wanted. Katie came all the way from San Francisco.
787  [recognition dawning] The letter. [faster] She kept saying something about a letter in Dad's desk. [confused] I thought she was just rambling, but maybe—Katie, what if there's something there?
788  [peaceful] Together sounds right. [warm tone] Maybe grab coffee first, catch up properly? [tentative hope] I have two kids now—twins. They have your stubborn streak, believe it or not.
789  [professionally] Thank you for calling StreamPlus support, I understand your frustration. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account—K47-B92-MM4, correct? [apologetically] I see you've had some trouble with our website, and I'm sorry about that.
790  [understanding] I completely understand, and looking at your account here, you've been a member since 2021. [more softly] Before we proceed with the cancellation, [professionally] may I ask what specific issues led to this decision—was it the content, or perhaps the pricing?
791  [sympathetically] That's totally understandable, subscription fatigue is real these days. [more enthusiastically] What if I could offer you our lite plan for just $7.99 a month? [hopefully] That's a 68% discount, and you'd keep access to our core library.
792  [acknowledging] I respect your decision, absolutely, and I'll process that cancellation right away. [carefully] Just to confirm, you want to cancel effective immediately? [informatively] You'll lose access at the end of your current billing cycle on November 15th, 2024.
793  [reassuringly] No additional charges at all—you've already paid through November 15th, so you're just getting what you've paid for. [professionally] I'm sending a confirmation email to your registered address, [clearly] and your cancellation reference number is CX-20241024-7789B. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help with today?
794  [professionally] Good afternoon, this is Mike from Precision Home Inspections returning your call. [clearing throat] I understand you have some concerns about the inspection report we completed yesterday?
795  [defensively] Sir, I assure you I did access the attic through the pull-down stairs. [more firmly] The moisture readings were off the charts, and there were visible—[pause]—dark stains on several rafters.
796  [quickly, nervously] Well, sometimes these issues aren't visible in photos, especially if—if taken with flash. [more confidently] Mold can hide behind insulation, and my thermal camera picked up significant temperature variations.
797  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, truly. [speaking faster] Perhaps we should schedule a reinspection—no charge obviously—and I can bring my moisture meter documentation from yesterday's visit.
798  [calmly] Sir, I've been doing this for fifteen years, and I stand by my findings. [more assertively] However, if there's been an error, we need to—to rectify this immediately. [urgently] Can we meet at the property this afternoon?
799  [briskly] I'll be there with my full kit and all yesterday's readings documented. [reassuringly] We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise you that.
800  [slightly offended] Mr. Davidson, I did access that attic, and I have the photos to—[catching himself] [more professionally] Let's review everything together at three, shall we?
801  [quickly] That's absolutely your right, and honestly, I'd welcome a second opinion. [confidently] Professional oversight never hurt anyone, especially when there's this much confusion.
802  [earnestly] Sir, I report what I see, nothing more, nothing less. [pause] If I made an error—which I doubt—but if I did, [firmly] I'll own it completely.
803  [professionally] Understood completely. [speaking quicker] I'll also bring contact information for remediation specialists, just in case my findings are confirmed and you need quick action for the sellers.
804  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, thanks for, um, "accidentally" scheduling that meeting during my lunch break for the third time this week. [Tsk] [Fast] Real subtle.
805  [Disappointed] I just—I don't understand why every email has to have that little dig at the end, you know? [Sigh]
806  [Whisper] Did you hear what she said about my presentation? [Slow] Something about how it was "surprisingly competent for someone at my level."
807  [Happy] No no, I actually love getting credit for my work! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Even if it's, like, buried in the appendix where nobody'll see it.
808  [Angry] I'm gonna—actually, you know what, I'm done pretending those comments are just jokes. [Groan]
809  [Fast] Okay so basically they're saying I did it wrong but they won't actually tell me what the right way is? [Disappointed] [Tsk]
810  [Sad] It's kinda exhausting, honestly, trying to figure out if they're actually mad or just being... them. [Sigh]
811  [Shout] Yes, I heard you the first time! [Angry] [Fast] The passive-aggressive sticky notes aren't making your point any clearer!
812  [Slow] I mean, when someone says "whatever you think is best" but then, like, undermines every decision you make... [Disappointed] [Sigh]
813  [Chuckle] Sure, cc'ing the boss on every tiny thing is totally normal behavior, right? [Sarcastic]
814  [Whisper] [Fast] They literally waited until I left to redo the entire project setup—didn't even tell me, I just found out from Sarah.
815  [Happy] Oh, I'm fine! [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Just peachy with being volunteered for weekend work through a group email!
816  [Angry] The thing is—no, actually, forget professional courtesy, they're just being a jerk at this point. [Groan]
817  [Sad] [Slow] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, um, if I'm being too sensitive about this whole situation or if it's really happening.
818  [Disappointed] Another backhanded compliment about how I'm "getting better at least"—gee, thanks for the, uh, the encouragement. [Tsk]
819  [Fast] [Whisper] Quick question—is it normal for someone to "forget" to invite you to team drinks like four times in a row?
820  [Shout] I wasn't even—I didn't ask for your help! [Angry] [Fast] But sure, go ahead and tell everyone how you "fixed" my work!
821  [Chuckle] Y'know, I've started keeping screenshots of everything 'cause somehow my ideas become their ideas pretty quickly. [Sarcastic]
822  [Slow] [Sad] It's the constant little comments that just... they kinda wear you down after a while, I guess. [Sigh]
823  [Happy] Honestly? [Laugh] [Sarcastic] Nothing says "teamwork" like being told you're "brave" for presenting that "interesting" approach!
824  [casual] So I had this weird thing happen at work today. My manager asked if I'd finished reviewing those client contracts, and I was like, yeah, totally done. Which, you know, I wasn't completely done, but I was like ninety percent there. [conversational] It's not a big deal, right? I mean, everyone does that. You say you're done when you're mostly done. [light laugh] I figured I'd just wrap up the last few pages tonight and no one would know the difference. [a bit uncertain] But then I started thinking about it, because you know how they have us log everything in that system now? Like, every time we open a document, when we save it, all that digital footprint stuff? [more worried] And I'm realizing— wait. [nervous laugh] If they really wanted to check, they could just look at the timestamps, right? Like when I last accessed those files? [growing anxiety] Oh god. Oh no. The last entry was yesterday morning. Yesterday! [sharp exhale] If my manager pulls that report, it's gonna show I haven't even touched those contracts since before she asked me about them. [spiraling] What am I gonna do? I can't just— I can't go back and say "Actually, funny story..." [groan] She's gonna think I'm completely incompetent. Or worse, dishonest! Which I guess I am now? [frantic] Ugh, why did I say that?
825  Oh god, okay—I know, I know exactly what this is about. Listen, I was having such a weird night and I didn't mean to—actually no, that's not an excuse. I'm sorry.
826  Wait, they cried? Oh no no no, I didn't—I had no idea they actually... [groan] This is so much worse than I thought. I'm such an idiot.
827  I just—okay, I was trying to be funny, y'know? Like that thing where you tease someone to break the ice but I totally misread the room and went way too far. I didn't realize they'd take it so personally.
828  I do! I do know that, which makes it even worse honestly. I just got carried away with the whole—ugh, I dunno, trying to seem cool or whatever. [nervous laugh] Which obviously backfired spectacularly.
829  They—what? No, are you serious? God, I'm literally the worst friend. I should've just kept my mouth shut instead of making those stupid comments about their job.
830  Right, yeah, that too. I was just—I was nervous meeting them properly for the first time and when I'm nervous I just kinda... word vomit everywhere. But that's not—they don't deserve that.
831  Can I—would it be okay if I called them? To apologize? Or would that make it worse? I genuinely wanna make this right but I don't know if they'd even wanna hear from me at this point. [sigh]
832  Yeah, of course they are. God, I really really messed up. Look, I'll—I'll write them a proper apology. Like not a text, an actual letter or something. Would that help?
833  And you—are we okay? I mean, I know we're not okay okay, but like... you're my best friend and I basically insulted the person you love. That's so messed up of me.
834  Okay. Yeah, that's—that's fair. Thank you for even talking to me about this instead of just... cutting me off. I promise I'll fix this. Whatever it takes, seriously.
835  Wait wait wait—your what? The potato— [Gasp] oh my god, the crispy smashed potato thing? That went viral?
836  That's—okay that's actually insane. Like, literally insane. How are you feeling about it? Because I'd be, um, totally freaking out right now, honestly.
837  Australia! Okay no no no, that's—you're literally international now! Have you been, like, reading all the comments and stuff?
838  But it's YOUR potatoes! I mean—okay yeah, but like, you created something that people actually love, y'know? That's kinda [Laugh] that's amazing though.
839  Oh god, the—ugh, the influencer types? They're probably gonna, like, steal your recipe and pretend they invented it or something. Are you gonna respond?
840  Well maybe you should! I mean—wait, actually, do you even want one? Because like, this could be a whole thing if you wanted it to be.
841  Of course she does! [Chuckle] That's so—that's such a mom thing. She's probably telling literally everyone she knows, right? Like "my child's famous on the internet!"
842  Stop it—there's a remix? Of potatoes? I need to—okay you're sending me that immediately because that sounds absolutely ridiculous and I'm kinda here for it.
843  They're WHAT? No no no, that's—that's not okay! That's literally your thing! Are you gonna, like, do something about that? Because that's basically stealing, right?
844  Okay but still—I mean, you're being way too chill about this. You basically broke the internet with potatoes and you're just... sitting there. That's the most you thing ever, honestly.
845  [muttering] Okay, so my phone's at, like, twelve percent, which is— which is not great. Let me just, um, let me plug this in and— [sigh] oh, come on. It's not— it's not charging. [slightly annoyed] Is it the outlet? No, the outlet's fine, I literally just used it for my, um, for my laptop charger yesterday. So it's gotta be— wait, let me just wiggle this thing a little bit. [concentrating] Okay, if I just— if I hold it like this and kind of— [huh] oh! There it goes. It's charging now. But like, why do I have to— I mean, that's not normal, right? [resigned] So apparently I have to, um, I have to hold my charger at this weird little angle now. Great. That's, uh, that's super convenient for my lifestyle. Let me just— can I lean it against something? Maybe if I prop it with this book... [testing] Okay, okay, it's still going. As long as nobody breathes on it too hard, we should be— we should be fine. This is fine. Everything's fine.
846  [whispered] Look at them up there. [voice breaking] My little Emily's actually remembering all her lines. [sniffling] I thought she'd freeze like in the living room rehearsals, but she's absolutely glowing under those lights.
847  [growling] Twenty years, Sal. [louder] Twenty goddamn years we ran this neighborhood together! [Bitter laugh] And now I find out you've been feeding information to the Torrelli family behind my back this whole time.
848  [shocked whisper] My nephew? [building rage] You're lying through your teeth! [Slamming sound] That kid would never cross me, unlike you, selling us out for what—a bigger cut of the waterfront action?
849  [trembling with fury] Survive? [screaming] We're dead men walking now! Every family in the city knows we can't keep our house clean. [lower, menacing] You signed our death warrants with your greed.
850  [through gritted teeth] I trusted you with everything—my business, my family's safety. [voice cracking] My daughter calls you Uncle Sal! [Roaring] How do I explain to her that Uncle Sal got her father killed?
851  [disbelieving] Your mother? [Hollow laugh] That's your excuse? We swore an oath on our fathers' graves! [quieter, deadly] Blood before everything else, remember? Or did that mean nothing to you?
852  [quiet rage] Marino was different. He was stealing from the family, not protecting it. [voice rising] But you? [Disgusted exhale] You sold our routes, our contacts, our entire operation's blueprint to our enemies!
853  [stunned silence] [whispering] How did you... [explosive] That was to keep them off our backs! I was feeding them false information about the Torrellis, you idiot! It was all part of the plan!
854  [weary] Because I couldn't trust anyone. [more bitterly] Turns out I was right. [Shaking voice] The paranoia, the sleepless nights—all justified. Even my oldest friend would stick a knife in my back.
855  [softly] Is that what this is about? [incredulous shout] Your ego? [quieter, dangerous] People are going to die because you felt disrespected? Our whole crew will be slaughtered within the week!
856  [contemplative] Run? [Bitter laugh] After everything we built? [firm resolve] No, if I'm going down, I'm taking every last one of those bastards with me, including the rat who sold us out.
857  [confused] Hi, I'm calling about my appointment—I think it's Thursday at 2:30? [hesitant] My confirmation number is, uh, K47-B92, but [trails off] the text message says something different about Dr. Peterson?
858  [frustrated] No, no, that can't be right—I specifically asked for Thursday because, well, [sighs] I work Wednesdays. [more insistently] And who's Dr. Martinez? I've been seeing Dr. Peterson for three years!
859  [exasperated] The 18th? That's—wait, [groans] that's two weeks away! [pleading] Look, my prescription expired last Tuesday, patient ID number 558921, and I literally can't see properly without my glasses.
860  [relieved] North Hills, that's... [calculating] maybe twenty minutes? [eagerly] Yes, I'll take it! [quickly] But wait, do they accept my BlueCross insurance, plan number BC-44829-X?
861  [worried] Fifteen minutes early means... [mumbles] 11:30. [anxiously] And you're sure, absolutely sure it's tomorrow, November 3rd? [desperately] Because last time there was a mix-up and I waited for an hour.
862  [uncertain] That's my old number—no, wait, [correcting] it ends in 0174, not 0147. [sighs heavily] This is why I can't see anything clearly, these numbers all blur together without my glasses.
863  [suddenly remembering] Oh God, I just remembered—[panicked] my insurance card says I need referral code from my primary doctor! [frantically] Do I need to call Dr. Walsh's office first, or can you handle that?
864  [doubtful] Are you absolutely certain? Because last year at your Riverside office, [frustrated mumble] they made me wait while they called to verify, and—[trails off] actually, maybe that was for something else entirely.
865  [relieved sigh] Okay, okay, so tomorrow, 11:30 arrival for 11:45 appointment. [confirming] North Hills, 7661 Maple Avenue, Dr. Martinez, confirmation J89-C21. [chuckles nervously] I should probably write this down somewhere.
866  [grateful] Thank you so much for your patience—I know I'm probably, uh, [embarrassed] not the easiest customer today. [sincerely] These blurry weeks have been really frustrating, honestly.
867  [briskly] Good afternoon, this is Sarah with HomeGuard Warranty Services, how can I— [more cheerfully] Oh, I see you're calling about claim number 47829. [quickly] Unfortunately, that claim has been denied due to, uh, pre-existing damage conditions.
868  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir, I really do. [more formally] According to our technician's report dated last Tuesday, there was significant rust and— [quickly] corrosion present that indicates long-term deterioration, not covered under your policy terms.
869  [defensively] Sir, our technicians are fully certified and trained to identify— [sighs] Look, I can escalate this to my supervisor if you'd like. [more quietly] But honestly, the decision rarely changes once the initial assessment is complete.
870  [quickly] I'll need to place you on a brief hold while I— [more reassuringly] Actually, wait, let me check something first. [rapidly] Sometimes if there's documentation of regular maintenance, we can file an appeal through a different department.
871  [genuinely] No, no, this could actually work in your favor. [more enthusiastically] If you can email those receipts to claims-review@homeguard.com, I'll— [quickly] I'll personally flag it for expedited review within 24 hours.
872  [urgently] Sir, before you consider that, please know that— [more calmly] Once we receive your documentation, there's a strong chance for reversal. [quickly] I'm noting your account now with my direct extension, 2847.
873  [sympathetically] Oh, in-laws visiting without hot water would be— [chuckles nervously] That's definitely urgent. [more professionally] I'm marking this as priority and, between you and me, mentioning the weekend deadline in my notes.
874  [understanding] Trust me, I get at least ten calls like yours daily. [more quietly] The system isn't perfect, but— [quickly] Send those receipts with "Attention Sarah" in the subject line, it'll come straight to me.
875  [hesitantly] Well, I shouldn't really say specific numbers, but— [whispers] With proper maintenance documentation? [more confidently] About seventy percent get overturned, especially for water heaters.
876  [impressed] Photos too? Perfect, that definitely helps our case. [briskly] Once I receive them, I'll call you directly with an update, no need to— [quickly] to wait on hold or explain everything again.
877  [Disappointed] I mean, we literally said seven-thirty, and it's—what, almost nine now? [Sigh] I dunno why I even bother making reservations anymore.
878  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, you're actually here! [Chuckle] Should I, like, mark this historic moment in my calendar or something?
879  [Happy] You know what, I'm just gonna start telling you the wrong time—like, two hours early! [Laugh] Problem solved, right?
880  [Angry] This is the third time this week you've left me sitting here like an idiot! [Groan] I'm done, seriously.
881  [Whisper] Everyone's staring at me 'cause I've been alone at this table for forty-five minutes. [Tsk] It's honestly embarrassing.
882  [Fast] Okay so next time—and I mean this—next time you're late, I'm leaving, no questions asked. [Disappointed] I gotta draw the line somewhere.
883  [Sad] I just... I feel like my time doesn't matter to you, y'know? [Sigh] That's what it feels like.
884  [Shout] Are you kidding me right now?! [Angry] The movie started an hour ago!
885  [Slow] You ever notice how, um, how I'm always the one waiting? [Disappointed] [Tsk] It's kinda becoming a pattern here.
886  [Chuckle] My other friends have started taking bets on how late you'll be. [Sarcastic] Jerry won twenty bucks last week, so thanks for that.
887  [Happy] [Fast] Actually, being early gave me time to—oh wait, you wouldn't know what that's like, would you? [Laugh]
888  [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if you're late on purpose, like maybe you just... don't wanna hang out anymore.
889  [Angry] [Fast] Don't even—don't you dare give me the traffic excuse again, we both know you left your house ten minutes ago!
890  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Let me guess, your alarm didn't go off, or wait—no, your cat had an emergency, right?
891  [Disappointed] I already ate, paid the bill, and basically had dinner with the waiter instead. [Sigh] He was actually pretty interesting, so... thanks?
892  [Shout] [Happy] Hey, you made it before midnight! That's gotta be some kind of record! [Laugh]
893  [Tsk] You realize the surprise party was, uh, supposed to be a surprise, right? [Angry] She got here before you did!
894  [Sad] [Slow] I used to defend you when people called you flaky, but I'm kinda running out of excuses here.
895  [Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh no no, take your time, I'm just—I'm literally aging while I wait, but sure, stop for coffee!
896  [Whisper] Honestly? [Sigh] I've started bringing a book everywhere 'cause I know—I just know you're gonna be at least half an hour late.
897  [excited] Oh my God, okay, so you know how I've been like obsessively checking LinkedIn? Well I finally, I finally found something that's actually— it's perfect. Like this marketing coordinator position at that nonprofit I was telling you about, the one that does the, um, the environmental stuff? [enthusiastic] And I know someone who works there! Remember Jake from college? He's like been there for two years and he said he could put in a good word for me, which is— that's huge, right? That's like exactly what I needed. [worried] [faster] But now I'm like spiraling because what if, what if his good word doesn't actually mean anything? Like what if they're just being polite and they already have someone internal or— God, what if I'm not even qualified enough? The posting says two years experience and I only have like one and a half if you're being generous... [anxious] And I keep refreshing my email every five minutes like some kind of— [nervous laugh] I sent my application yesterday morning and I know that's like no time at all but I just— I can't stop thinking about it and— [surprised] [brightening] Oh! Oh wait, that's— my phone's ringing and it's a number I don't know. Should I— I think I should answer this, right? [excited] [relieved] Oh my God, that was them! They want to schedule an interview for Friday! [laugh] I can't believe it, this is actually happening!
898  Wait wait wait—the one you auditioned for last week? The—oh my god, the national one? Are you serious right now?
899  I'm gonna—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is so huge! What's it for again? Some kinda... was it insurance or something?
900  Stop it. You're gonna be the cereal dad? [Laugh] That's—honestly that's adorable. Wait, so when do you start filming? Do you get, like, free cereal for life or—
901  Tuesday! That's so soon! Oh my god, are you—are you nervous? I'd be completely freaking out right now. Like, completely.
902  Okay but it's YOUR thirty seconds, y'know? Your face on TV! Have you told your parents yet? Your mom's gonna absolutely lose it—in the best way.
903  I'm—wait, I'm first? [Softer] Oh babe, that's so sweet. But like, why aren't you more excited? This is literally what you've been working towards!
904  Weird how? Like imposter syndrome weird or like... something else? Because honestly, you deserve this. You've been grinding at those auditions for what—two years now?
905  Four callbacks means they really, really wanted you specifically. Not just anyone—you. That's gotta mean something, right? [Sigh] I dunno, I just hate seeing you doubt yourself.
906  See! There we go—that's something! How good are we talking? Like, quit-your-day-job good or just nice-vacation good?
907  Okay okay okay—now you're just being modest. Six months?! That's—you're buying dinner next time, just so we're clear. And I want the fancy place with the little bread rolls.
908  [muttering to self] Oh. Oh no. Um, okay, so— so my zipper is, uh, it's completely down right now. Like, completely. How long has it been— how long have I been walking around like this? [slightly mortified] I mean, I just came from the, um, the coffee shop, and then I was at the— oh god, I was at the grocery store too. Did people see? They probably saw, right? People always notice these things but they don't, uh, they don't say anything because it's weird to— [faster, anxious] Wait wait wait, when did I last— when did I go to the bathroom? This morning? Was it zipped then? I can't— I can't remember if I, um, if I zipped it back up or if I just— [groan] this is so— [resigned, working through it] Okay, you know what, it's, uh, it's not that big a deal. People probably didn't notice, or if they did, they're not gonna, like, remember it forever. It's just a zipper. Just a— a very obvious zipper that was down for who knows how long. [quietly accepting] Right. Okay. Crisis averted, I guess.
909  [knowingly] Mija, your headache won't go away until you put a potato slice on your forehead. [more insistent] My mother taught me this, and her mother before her. [Soft chuckle] Trust your abuela—these old remedies work better than pills.
910  [defensive whisper] Science doesn't know everything, mi amor. [building volume] When you were a baby with colic, I rubbed an egg over your belly and you stopped crying! [triumphant] Explain that with your Google searches!
911  [Scoff] Medicine, medicine! [in a mocking tone] Your grandfather had pneumonia once and I cured him with onion tea and prayer. [quieter] The doctors said he wouldn't make it, but look—forty more years he lived.
912  [warmly] Ah, now you're learning! [mysterious whisper] The soup has my secret—a blessing whispered three times while stirring clockwise. [more firmly] Your cousin Maria's fever broke after just one bowl last week, you saw it yourself.
913  [Cackling] Weird? [indignant] Being healthy is weird now? [in a low rumble] Fine, when everyone else catches that nasty cold going around, don't come crying to me for my eucalyptus steam treatment that actually works.
914  [smugly] So now you admit I know things! [rapid fire] The hiccup cure, the nightmare prevention, the evil eye ward—all real, mija. [whispering intensely] Your modern world forgot the wisdom our ancestors discovered through centuries.
915  [Gentle laugh] The lavender is my grandmother's recipe—picked under a full moon, dried with rosemary. [nostalgic tone] She lived to ninety-six with barely a sniffle. [firmly] These traditions kept our family strong through everything.
916  [hurt quietly] You think I'm just a foolish old woman. [more passionate] But when you have children, you'll understand—sometimes love and tradition heal what medicine cannot touch. [Sniffling] A mother knows things science hasn't discovered yet.
917  [considering slowly] Maybe... but you must promise to try my ginger compress for your cramps. [excited whisper] And wear the red string I blessed! [Chuckle] Your science can't hurt either, I suppose—extra protection never killed anyone.
918  [grumbling] Fine, fine, hospitals for emergencies. [brighter] But everything else, we try my way first! [confident declaration] Your children will thank me someday when they know both worlds—the old wisdom and the new.
919  [confused] Um, excuse me, I was just browsing around and saw this—this 3D printer thing? [hesitant] Model XR-2400, I think the tag says. [curiously] What exactly needs calibrating on these machines, because honestly, I don't even know why I'm looking at it.
920  [overwhelmed] Wait, wait, Z-what now? [laughs nervously] I came in here for a phone charger and somehow ended up in aisle 14-B staring at this thing. [bewildered] Does it really need that much adjusting?
921  [skeptical] Fifty hours? [groans] That's like—I don't know—two full days of printing stuff? [in a slower tone] What happens if you don't calibrate it, does it just explode or something?
922  [amused] Spaghetti printing? [snorts] That actually sounds kind of fun though. [thoughtfully] So if I hypothetically bought this $1,299 machine—which I'm not—how long would calibration take?
923  [sarcastically] Oh great, more letters and numbers! [sighs deeply] G29, E-steps... it's like learning a new language. [genuinely curious] Do people actually enjoy fiddling with all these settings at home?
924  [surprised] Twenty-four seven support? [impressed] That's more available than my therapist! [jokingly] Maybe I should call them about my life calibration issues too, heh.
925  [thoughtfully] Fifty thousand people talking about nozzles? [whistles] That's a lot of—um—nozzle enthusiasm. [more seriously] What's the worst calibration mistake someone could make with this thing?
926  [shocked] Eighty-nine dollars for one part?! [groans loudly] My entire shopping list today was under fifty bucks! [resignedly] How often do these expensive bits need replacing anyway?
927  [sarcastically] Oh good, only twelve dollars for a tube! [chuckles] I don't even know what PTFE stands for but sure. [curiously] Do you personally own one of these calibration nightmares?
928  [amazed] Fourteen hours for a dragon? [exhales] That's longer than my last relationship! [laughing] You know what, I'm still just gonna buy my phone charger, but this was weirdly educational.
929  [professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling the Grand Metropolitan Hotel. [briskly] How may I assist you today?
930  [sympathetically] I understand that must be frustrating, sir. [more quickly] Let me pull up your reservation—may I have your confirmation number?
931  [typing pace] Alright, I see your booking here for tomorrow. [more hesitantly] Unfortunately, our cancellation policy requires 48 hours notice, so [apologetically] there would be a charge of one night's stay.
932  [calmly] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [more firmly] However, the policy applies regardless of the reason, though [quickly] I can offer you a credit for a future stay instead of losing the full amount.
933  [professionally] Certainly, I can transfer you to my supervisor. [more briskly] Before I do, I should mention—if you have travel insurance, [helpfully] they typically cover these types of cancellations due to flight issues.
934  [encouragingly] Yes, exactly! [quickly] If you file a claim with them first, then send us the approval, [more warmly] we can process a full refund within 3-5 business days.
935  [understandingly] No apologies necessary, travel disruptions are incredibly stressful. [efficiently] Let me email you the documentation requirements right now—what's the best address?
936  [warmly] That's very kind of you to say. [briskly] I've sent that email—you should see it momentarily with all the steps clearly outlined.
937  [quickly] The credit would be valid for twelve months from today's date. [reassuringly] You can apply it to any room type, even during peak season, though [matter-of-factly] blackout dates around major holidays do apply.
938  [professionally] Perfect, that sounds like a good plan. [helpfully] If you need any assistance with the documentation or have questions, [warmly] just reference this case number—TR-9982—when you call back.
939  [Slow] So, um, you were saying about the conference—sorry, I'm totally blanking on your, uh... [Nervous laugh] [Fast] remind me again?
940  [Happy] Oh my god, yes! [Laugh] That's exactly what—wait, hold on, I literally just had your name and now it's gone!
941  [Whisper] I know we met at Sarah's party, and I remember your face perfectly, but your name is just... [Tsk] [Sigh] not coming to me.
942  [Angry] This is so frustrating—I pride myself on remembering names and I just—ugh! [Groan] It's right there on the tip of my tongue!
943  [Sarcastic] Yeah, no, I'm doing great, just having a complete mental breakdown trying to remember what to call you. [Chuckle] Super professional of me, right?
944  [Fast] Okay so I'm gonna be honest here—I'm terrible with names and yours is just, like, completely gone from my brain. [Disappointed] I'm so sorry.
945  [Slow] Was it... Michael? [Tsk] No, that's not—Marcus maybe?
946  [Shout] Wait! Don't tell me! [Happy] I got this, I got this—it starts with a J, doesn't it?
947  [Sad] I feel awful about this, but I literally cannot—your name has just vanished and I... [Sigh] I really should know this.
948  [Disappointed] We've worked together for, what, three months? [Slow] And I still can't get your name to stick in my head properly.
949  [Fast] You know what's weird? [Chuckle] I remember you hate cilantro and have two cats, but your actual name? Completely gone.
950  [Whisper] Please don't be offended, but I'm having the worst—like, the absolute worst brain fog right now. [Nervous laugh] What was your name again?
951  [Angry] My brain is literally betraying me right now—I swear I knew this five seconds ago! [Groan] [Fast] This is embarrassing.
952  [Happy] Oh, you're gonna laugh at this, but I've been calling you "coffee shop guy" in my head for weeks! [Laugh] What's your actual name?
953  [Sarcastic] Sure, let me just pretend I haven't forgotten the most basic piece of information about you. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Real smooth.
954  [Slow] I wanna say... Rebecca? [Sad] No, that's my dentist—sorry, I'm mixing everyone up today.
955  [Shout] Don't move! [Fast] If you stay really still, maybe your name will come back to me—is that how memory works?
956  [Disappointed] This is gonna sound bad, but, um... [Sigh] I've been avoiding saying your name for like ten minutes now.
957  [Whisper] Hey, so this is awkward, but my ex has the same name as you and I keep—I dunno, blocking it out? [Chuckle] [Fast] What is it again?
958  [Happy] You know what? [Laugh] Let's just start over—hi, I'm having a complete mental meltdown, what's your name?
959  [frustrated] Dude, I cannot even tell you how pissed off I was this morning. My coffee maker just— it just died on me, like completely dead. I press the button, nothing. Not even a little light or a, a beep or whatever. [annoyed] And you know me, I can't function without my coffee, like I literally cannot be a human being before I've had at least one cup. So I'm standing there in my pajamas just pressing this stupid button over and over like an idiot, like that's gonna magically fix it. [increasingly irritated] I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, checked the outlet with my phone charger— everything works fine except this piece of junk. And it's not even that old! I got it like, what, eight months ago? [exasperated] So finally I just— [laugh] okay this is embarrassing but I literally smacked it. Like gave it a good whack on the side because I was so frustrated and— [surprised] [amused] Oh my god, it started working. Like immediately. Just started brewing like nothing happened. I'm standing there like, did I just— did I just fix it by hitting it? [laughing] I mean, I got my coffee, so I'm not complaining, but what kind of— what kind of engineering is that? Note to self: percussive maintenance actually works sometimes.
960  Oh my—wait, what? Are you... are you serious right now? I mean, obviously you're serious, you wouldn't joke about—wow. Okay. Um, how are you feeling?
961  This morning? So this is like, brand new information. God, no wonder you seem kinda... shell-shocked? Do you wanna talk about it or—actually, wait, have you told anyone else yet?
962  Just me. Okay. Okay okay. [Exhale] That's—I'm honored, honestly? But also like, holy shit. Sorry, I'm trying to be calm but this is huge. Have you, um, have you thought about what you're gonna do?
963  No no no, that makes total sense. You literally just found out. Your brain's probably doing that thing where it's like... processing but also not processing, y'know? It's a lot.
964  Do you—I mean, does he know? Or wait, am I allowed to ask that? I don't wanna pry, but like... you don't have to go through this alone is all I'm saying. [Softer] You know that, right?
965  Oh. Oh shit. That's—okay that definitely complicates things. Two weeks ago means... wait, you were already—but didn't know—god, that timing is actually cruel.
966  Are you gonna tell him? I mean, you don't have to decide right now, obviously. But like... ugh, this is so hard. I just wanna hug you. Can I—can I come over? Bring food or something?
967  Yeah, no, I get that. Your stomach's probably doing the whole— [Groan] anxiety thing. But you should eat something, even if it's just like, crackers or whatever. Keep your strength up while you figure this out, y'know?
968  Totally. Totally fair. Just... sitting with it is good. But hey, whenever you're ready to like, talk through options or cry or scream or literally whatever you need? I'm here. Day or night, seriously.
969  Of course, babe. That's what I'm here for. And listen—whatever you decide? It's gonna be the right choice because it's yours, okay? Just... remember that.
970  Oh—um, what do you mean? Did I—wait, did I do something wrong? I mean, I probably did, I just... I'm not sure what specifically you're talking about?
971  Okay, okay, you're mad. I can tell you're mad. Is this about—oh god, is this about earlier? When you were talking about your trip and I brought up Barcelona? [nervous laugh] That was—I didn't mean to—
972  Oh. Oh no. I—wait, I do that? No no no, I mean, I guess I do but I never—it's not on purpose! I swear it's not like I'm trying to compete or anything, I just get excited and—
973  That's not—I don't think they're better! I really don't! It's just like, when you share something it reminds me of something similar and I wanna connect, y'know? Like "oh hey, me too!" But I'm—[groan] I'm realizing how that sounds now.
974  God, I'm—I'm so sorry. Really. I had no idea I was doing that to you. I mean, thinking about it now, I can totally see it. My mom literally does the same thing and it drives me crazy so I should've—I should've known better.
975  You're right. You're completely right and that's—that's awful of me. I think I just get carried away? Like I genuinely think I'm relating but actually I'm just... hijacking. Your moments. Which is so messed up, I'm sorry.
976  You should be! You absolutely should be—it was huge! And I just—god, I trampled all over it talking about my thing, didn't I? [sigh] I'm such an idiot. You worked so hard for that and I couldn't just... let you have it.
977  I don't—I dunno why I do this. Maybe I'm just really insecure or something? But that's not an excuse, I know it's not. Your stories matter and I should be listening, actually listening, not just waiting for my turn to—to show off or whatever I'm doing.
978  Wait wait wait—you dread talking to me? Oh man, that's... that really hurts to hear but I—I get it. I do. And I'm gonna fix this, okay? Like, I'm literally gonna tape my mouth shut if I have to.
979  Yes. Yes, absolutely. From now on when you tell me something, I'm gonna actually celebrate it with you instead of making it about—about me. I promise. And if I slip up, which I probably will at first, just... call me out? Please? I wanna be better at this. At being your friend.
980  I know, I know how it looks, but honestly, I didn't mean to bail on you again. Things just—they got crazy at work and then my mom needed help with her car, and I literally couldn't make it.
981  That's not—okay, that's not entirely fair. I show up for stuff! I was there for your birthday, I helped you move, I—[scoff] you're making it sound like I'm this total flake.
982  And I wanted to be there! I did! But my boss literally called me in last minute and I can't just—I can't lose this job, okay? You know that.
983  Look look, I get that you're mad, but I'm trying to help people when they ask. I don't wanna be that person who just says no to everything. [frustrated laugh] Sorry for actually caring about people, I guess.
984  Okay, that's—wow. That's kinda harsh. I'm not "disappearing," things come up. Life happens. And honestly? You're not exactly understanding about it when it does.
985  Not always! That's such an—ugh, that's such an exaggeration and you know it. Yeah, fine, I've had to cancel some stuff lately, but I'm drowning here trying to keep everyone happy.
986  What's that supposed to mean? Stop trying to be a good friend? Stop trying to—I mean, I thought that's what friends do, they try to show up for each other.
987  [Sigh] I know I messed up the fundraiser thing, okay? I feel terrible about it. But you're acting like I do this on purpose, like I wake up thinking "how can I let people down today?"
988  Because people need help! My sister needs babysitting, my coworker needs a ride, you need fundraiser help—I can't just tell everyone to fuck off, can I? I'm trying to juggle everything here.
989  Fine. Fine, you're right. I should've—I should've said no from the start. But honestly? [quieter] Sometimes it feels like no matter what I do, it's gonna disappoint someone. Including you.
990  [muttering] Wait, that's— that's weird. I literally just threw that away, like, ten minutes ago, and now it's— it's in the recycling bin. [confused] I mean, I'm pretty sure I put it in the, um, the regular trash, right? The little one by my desk? [slightly puzzled] Okay, so either I'm, uh, I'm losing my mind, or someone moved it. But who would— who would move my trash? That's so weird. [hmm] Unless— unless I just, like, autopiloted it into the wrong bin? I do that sometimes with, um, with the dishes and stuff. [thinking out loud] Let me think. I had that yogurt container, and I was, um, I was definitely gonna throw it away, but maybe I just— maybe my brain went "container equals recycling" and I just, uh, I just put it there without thinking? [slightly amused] That's probably— yeah, that's probably what happened. I'm not going crazy, I'm just, um, I'm just running on muscle memory. [chuckle] Which is, uh, which is actually kind of good? Like, at least my subconscious is being environmentally responsible. [trailing off] Still weird though. I could've sworn I...
991  [Screaming] WE GOT IT! WE GOT THE MORRISON ACCOUNT! [jumping up and down] Three years of pitching, and they finally said yes! [voice cracking with joy] I can't believe this is actually happening right now!
992  [Breathless] I just got off the phone with their CEO! [squealing] She loved our sustainability angle! [more excited] Remember when everyone said we were crazy for that green initiative pivot? WHO'S CRAZY NOW?!
993  [Quieter, trembling] My mom didn't believe in this company. [building volume] She said I should've stayed at my corporate job. [explosive] LOOK AT US NOW, MOM! We're about to expand to three new offices!
994  [Sobbing with joy] I haven't slept properly in six months. [sniffling] All those rejected proposals, the failed pitches... [triumphant yell] Every single "no" led us to this massive, beautiful, life-changing YES!
995  [Sing-song voice] We're getting bonuses, we're getting bonuses! [normally] Remember eating ramen for three months straight? [roaring] GOODBYE INSTANT NOODLES, HELLO MICHELIN STARS! This is our moment! Our actual moment!
996  [Incredulous] They want us to start next Monday. [panicked excitement] NEXT MONDAY! That's four days away! [determined shout] We need to hire twenty people, like, yesterday! This is beautifully terrifying!
997  [Shaky voice] I keep thinking I'm dreaming. [firmly] But the email is right here—it's real. [overwhelming joy] Our tiny startup just beat out three Fortune 500 companies. David just destroyed Goliath!
998  [Hushed intensity] This changes everything—our lives, our futures. [building up] No more wondering if we'll make rent! [exploding] WE'RE GOING TO BE IN FORBES! The "Thirty Under Thirty" list, here we come!
999  [Giddy] The entire floor probably thinks we've lost our minds. [louder] Let them think whatever they want! [bellowing] WE JUST MADE COMPANY HISTORY! Ten years from now, they'll tell stories about today!
1000  [Softly reverent] We actually pulled it off. [growing stronger] All those people who believed in us were right. [joyful sob] I'm so proud of us—we're going to change this entire industry forever.
1001  [professionally] Good morning! I can help you with that sensor installation. [reassuringly] Let me pull up your account—could you confirm if you're at unit 12A or 12B? [more gently] And don't worry, I'll verify that account number for you right away.
1002  [sympathetically] I completely understand, and we'll make this as easy as possible for you. [cheerfully] I see here account KX-7742-B for unit 12A at Oak Ridge. [helpfully] Would you prefer our basic package with 6 sensors or the premium with 12?
1003  [optimistically] We actually have a technician available at 2:15 PM today! [efficiently] They'll need access code 9-9-4-7 for your building's main entrance, correct? [considerately] The installation typically takes 45 minutes, so you'll be all set before your nurse leaves.
1004  [reassuringly] No problem at all, I've updated that to 9-4-9-7. [accommodatingly] We can arrange digital consent through your registered email, sarah.chen at gmail. [gently] Or if you prefer, the technician can assist with any necessary paperwork.
1005  [softly] I'm adding a special note for quiet installation to your work order W-55621. [compassionately] Our technician, Marcus, specializes in medical recovery situations. [warmly] Is there anything else we should know to make you more comfortable during the installation process?
1006  [confirmingly] Absolutely, text notification to the number ending in 8-8-3-2, bedroom sensors last. [helpfully] I'm also seeing you qualify for our medical discount—25% off, bringing your monthly monitoring to $47.99. [encouragingly] Should I apply that to your account right now?
1007  [professionally] That case number is perfect for our records, thank you. [cheerfully] I've applied the discount and emailed your confirmation to sarah.chen at gmail. [informatively] The invoice shows installation fee waived due to medical circumstances—that saves you another $199.
1008  [enthusiastically] Yes, the AL-7700-X integrates perfectly with our system! [technically] We'll sync them during installation using protocol 4.2.1. [reassuringly] This means any sensor trigger can also alert your medical response team if needed.
1009  [attentively] I'm noting that Mrs. Peterson in 12C has the spare key for backup access. [confirmingly] Marcus will arrive at 2:15 PM with work order W-55621. [kindly] We'll also send a follow-up call tomorrow to ensure everything's working properly.
1010  [patiently] It's W-55621, and everything's documented in your email. [warmly] Please rest well, and Marcus will take excellent care of the installation. [gently] If you need anything else, our 24-hour line is always here. Take care, Sarah.
1011  [professionally] DMV customer service, this is Patricia speaking. [more quickly] How may I assist you with your licensing needs today?
1012  [calmly] I apologize for the inconvenience, sir. [briskly] Let me pull up your record—could you provide your license number and [more slowly] the last four digits of your social?
1013  [typing tone] Alright, I'm seeing your account here. [concerned] Oh, I do see the issue—it appears the system processed a one-month temporary extension instead of the full renewal. [more apologetically] This shouldn't have happened.
1014  [understanding] Absolutely, you're completely right. [quickly] I'm escalating this to our corrections department right now, and we'll expedite a corrected license. [reassuring] You won't be charged again, of course.
1015  [more firmly] This time it'll be different—five to seven business days, guaranteed. [briskly] I'm also noting your account for priority processing and [pause] waiving any fees for duplicate copies if needed.
1016  [quickly] I'm emailing you a temporary permit right now—check your inbox. [confidently] It's valid for ninety days and serves as [more slowly] legal proof of your valid license status.
1017  [apologetically] Different departments have different protocols, unfortunately. [more briskly] But yes, temporary permits can be emailed instantly for situations exactly like this.
1018  [professionally] Perfect. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help resolve while I have your account open? [helpfully] Address updates, registration renewals, anything?
1019  [chuckles softly] I hear that feedback often, believe me. [conspiratorially] Between you and me, they're supposedly launching a new system [pause] next year.
1020  [warmly] Thank you for your patience, sir. [briskly] Your corrected license will arrive within the week, and that temporary permit is valid immediately. [professionally] Have a great rest of your day.
1021  [Happy] Oh my god, that's, um, that's amazing news! [Fast] I mean, wow, you totally deserve this after everything you've been working on! [Laugh]
1022  [Sarcastic] Well, well, well—look who's finally joining the rest of us successful people, huh? [Chuckle] [Slow] Took you long enough, didn't it?
1023  [Disappointed] Yeah, no, that's—that's great. [Sigh] I guess some people just have all the luck, right?
1024  [Happy] [Fast] This is huge, like seriously huge, and I'm so—I mean, nobody deserves it more than you do! [Tsk]
1025  [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda thought I'd be the first one to, you know... [Slow] but hey, congratulations anyway.
1026  [Sad] I'm really happy for you, honestly, it's just—[Sigh] never mind, this is your moment and I don't wanna ruin it.
1027  [Shout] Are you kidding me right now? [Happy] [Laugh] That's literally the best thing I've heard all week—well, for you anyway!
1028  [Angry] Of course you got it, I mean—[Fast] no, sorry, that came out wrong, I'm thrilled, really thrilled for you.
1029  [Slow] So, um, when exactly did you find out about this whole thing? [Disappointed] [Tsk] 'Cause I've been waiting for months and nothing.
1030  [Happy] You're gonna be so good at this! [Sarcastic] I mean, some of us have been preparing for years, but sure, you'll figure it out.
1031  [Fast] Wait, they picked YOU? [Happy] [Laugh] That's—wow, okay, that's actually incredible news!
1032  [Whisper] Honestly? [Slow] I applied for the same thing and they basically told me I wasn't ready yet. [Chuckle]
1033  [Disappointed] That's, uh, that's really something. [Sigh] [Fast] Guess I should probably stop comparing myself to everyone else, right?
1034  [Shout] No way! [Happy] This calls for champagne—the expensive stuff that I definitely can't afford anymore! [Laugh]
1035  [Sad] [Slow] You know what's funny? I literally just got rejected from something similar yesterday, but... [Tsk] your timing's perfect.
1036  [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, another reminder that I'm basically falling behind while everyone else is—[Fast] sorry, I'm being weird, congratulations!
1037  [Angry] I just don't understand how these things work sometimes, like—[Groan] whatever, you earned it, I'm sure.
1038  [Happy] This is exactly what you needed! [Whisper] Even though I kinda needed it more, but we won't talk about that.
1039  [Slow] Remember when we used to joke about who'd make it first? [Disappointed] [Chuckle] Guess we have our answer now, don't we?
1040  [Fast] Okay so basically everyone's gonna be so jealous—I mean, proud! [Happy] [Laugh] Everyone's gonna be so proud of you!
1041  [casual] Oh, so I was, um, I was talking to that new girl at work today — Sarah? And I mentioned that I, uh, I know Maya Chen, you know, from— from that startup that got bought out last year. Just came up naturally in conversation, like, um, totally normal. [matter-of-fact] She seemed pretty impressed, which, you know, whatever. I mean, Maya and I, we— we definitely know each other, so it's not like I was, um, lying or anything. [slight pause, thinking] Actually, wait— let me think about this for a sec. How did— how did Maya even come up? Sarah was talking about, um, about wanting to get into tech, and I was like, "Oh, well my friend Maya—" [realization dawning] Oh god. Oh no. I— I literally steered the conversation there, didn't I? She was talking about her weekend plans and I was like, um, "Speaking of ambitious people, my friend Maya Chen..." [groan] Who even— who even says that? [cringing] I literally— I literally name-dropped someone I've met, like, twice at networking events! We're not— we don't even follow each other on Instagram! I called her my "friend" Maya! [frustrated laugh] [mortified] Oh my god, I'm— I'm that person now. I'm the, uh, the desperate social climber who— [whimper] Sarah probably thinks I'm such a— [defeated sigh] This is so embarrassing. I can't— I literally can't show my face in that office again!
1042  Oh god—okay, I didn't—I mean I did but it wasn't like... I wasn't gossiping or anything, I swear. We were just talking and it kinda slipped out and I immediately regretted it.
1043  No no no, that's—that's not what I meant. Not slipped out like it was nothing. I just... Marcus was talking about his own anxiety stuff and I wanted to be supportive so I mentioned—[groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I?
1044  I... yeah. I did. God, hearing you say it like that makes me wanna just disappear. I know how private that was, I know you trusted me with that and I just—I completely betrayed that trust, didn't I?
1045  What? No, that's—Marcus wouldn't have told anyone else, he promised me he... [nervous laugh] okay that sounds really stupid now that I'm saying it out loud. Of course he told people. Of course he did.
1046  You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm honestly disgusted with myself right now. Like, you came to me when you were struggling and trusted me with something so personal and I just... treated it like it was nothing.
1047  I know. I know it wasn't. And I think—no, I know that's what makes this so awful. You were being so brave, y'know? Opening up about everything you're going through and I just... I ruined that.
1048  Oh my god, I didn't even think about—that's where everyone hangs out. [sigh] I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I'll talk to them, I'll tell them to stop being weird about it or—or whatever you need me to do.
1049  Right, yeah, talking to them would probably—yeah. Um, is there... is there anything I can do? Like literally anything to make this even a little bit better? I just wanna fix this somehow but I don't—I dunno how.
1050  I know. You're right, I can't just—I can't undo what I did. But maybe I can... I mean, going forward, if you ever wanna talk about anything again—which you probably don't and I totally get that—but I promise I would never, ever break your trust again.
1051  Yeah, no, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—I really am sorry. And I hope... I hope eventually you can forgive me, but I get it if you can't. I really messed up and I—I know that.
1052  Oh god, I—I was gonna tell you, I swear. It wasn't planned or anything, I just—I was driving past the cemetery and I thought I'd stop for like five minutes, you know?
1053  I know, I know how it sounds. But listen, I—I wasn't thinking, okay? I was having such a bad morning and I just needed to [nervous laugh] I dunno, talk to her? That's—that's not an excuse though.
1054  We do. We always do, and I—fuck, I'm so sorry. I wasn't trying to exclude you or anything like that. It was honestly just this impulsive thing where I pulled over and—and then I was already there, y'know?
1055  That was—okay that was really stupid of me. Like genuinely, what was I thinking? I shouldn't have—I mean, of course you'd see it. [Groan] I'm such an idiot sometimes, I really am.
1056  I did! I did, I promise. I told her—I told her you were probably gonna kill me for coming without you, actually. And that you'd probably bring those yellow roses she liked next time.
1057  Oh. Oh no, I—we can go again? Like, together? I know it's not the same but maybe we could go this weekend and—and do it properly this time. The way we always do.
1058  Shit. Shit shit shit, you're right. I didn't even—I wasn't thinking about that. God, I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? [Sigh] I completely ruined it.
1059  Wait, you—you did? What kind of thing? No wait, that's—I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me. I don't deserve to know after what I—after this.
1060  The—the rosé she used to sneak us? Oh man, that's... that's really beautiful actually. We can—we can still do that, right? I mean, if you'll let me come with you?
1061  Yeah. Yeah, of course, take—take all the time you need. I really am sorry though. Like from the bottom of my heart. She meant everything to you and I—I should've remembered that. I should've waited.
1062  Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm literally the worst, I get it. But there was this whole thing with my car and then—wait, that's not even the point. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
1063  No no no, that's—okay, I hear how that sounds. It's not an excuse, I swear, it's just... [sigh] everything keeps happening at once, y'know? Like I genuinely wanna hang out, I do, but then something comes up and I—I dunno, I panic.
1064  Please don't do the one-word thing. I can't—I mean, I deserve it, obviously, but it's killing me. You're like, one of my favorite people and I keep screwing this up and I don't even know why I do this.
1065  What? No! That's not—god, is that really what you think? [nervous laugh] I care so much it's actually embarrassing. I literally had our plans in my calendar, with like three reminders, and then my sister called crying about her boyfriend and I just—I forgot everything else existed.
1066  Okay when you say it like that it sounds—it sounds stupid, I know. But she was really upset and I'm basically the only person she talks to about this stuff, and I meant to text you but then hours went by and—ugh, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Making excuses.
1067  I don't mean to be like this. Honestly, I think there's something wrong with me? Like I get so overwhelmed and then I just... freeze. And then I'm too anxious to reach out because I know you're mad—which makes it worse, I know I know.
1068  You're right. You're completely right. That's—that's the bare minimum and I couldn't even do that. [groan] I keep telling myself I'm gonna be better, like next time I won't mess up, but then I do and I hate myself for it.
1069  I know. And that's—that's completely fair. Um, what if we just... what if you pick something and I'll be there no matter what? Like literally nothing will stop me. I'll turn off my phone, tell everyone I'm dead, whatever it takes.
1070  No but this time—okay, I hear myself. But I mean it, I really really mean it this time. You matter to me, like so much, and I've been a garbage friend and I wanna fix this. Please let me—just let me prove it? One more chance?
1071  Yes! Okay, yes, one chance. I won't—I promise I won't mess this up. And if I even think about flaking I'll... I dunno, I'll Venmo you a hundred bucks or something. Actually yeah, let's do that. I'm putting it in writing right now.
1072  Wait, what? That was—I thought that was next week? I swear you said the fifteenth, not—god, I'm sorry, but I genuinely didn't know it was today.
1073  Okay, okay, I probably—look, I've been completely underwater with work stuff and I just... [sigh] I know that's not an excuse, but my brain's been like, completely fried lately.
1074  That's not—come on, that's not fair. You know I have issues with this stuff. I'm not just being careless, I literally can't hold onto things sometimes, y'know?
1075  And I wanna be there for you, I do, but you're acting like I'm doing this on purpose. Like I wake up and decide "hey, let's forget something important today." [frustrated laugh] That's not how it works.
1076  Seriously? You're gonna—that's such a low blow. Some things stick better than others, that doesn't mean I don't care about your stuff. I use reminders, I write everything down, I'm trying here.
1077  Look look, I get that you're upset, and you have every right to be, but I'm kinda getting tired of apologizing for something I literally cannot control sometimes.
1078  Oh wow, thanks, never thought of that. Just stop forgetting. [scoff] Why didn't I think of—you know what? You're being really dismissive right now about something that's actually really hard for me.
1079  I'm not—I'm not dismissing it! I feel terrible that I missed it, honestly I do, but I'm also asking for like, a tiny bit of understanding here? Maybe?
1080  Yeah, understanding. The thing friends are supposed to have for each other? I mean, I've been dealing with this my whole life and you're acting like it's some personal attack against you.
1081  And that's—okay, I hear that, I do. But I dunno what else to tell you. I'm doing my best, and if that's not enough for you, then... [trails off] I guess that's where we're at.
1082  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I just need to— I just need to open this thing. How hard can it be, right? It's just, uh, it's just cereal. [sigh] But this plastic is, like, welded shut or something. [slightly strained] Let me just— let me just try to find the, um, the little tab thing. There's always a tab, right? Or like a— a perforated edge or whatever they call it. [tsk] Nope, that's not— that's not doing anything. [frustrated but trying to stay calm] Okay okay okay, maybe I need, uh, maybe I need scissors? But then I have to go find scissors, and I'm already— I'm already standing here with my bowl out, and the milk is just, um, just sitting there getting warm or whatever. [determined] You know what, let me just— let me just use my teeth. I know that's probably not, uh, not the most elegant solution, but— [grunt] oh come on, seriously? [deadpan] Great. Now I've got plastic shreds in my mouth and the bag is still completely— completely intact. This is, um, this is going well. [resigned but amused] Scissors it is, I guess. [laugh] My cereal bowl can wait another two minutes while I go hunt down some basic tools to defeat this, uh, this impenetrable fortress of breakfast food.
1083  [concerned] Your eight-year-old was at the park alone yesterday. [voice rising] Did you know that? [Deep breath] I saw him climbing that enormous oak tree with no supervision whatsoever—he could've fallen and seriously hurt himself.
1084  [incredulous] Risk assessment? [louder] He's eight! [Scoff] My daughter doesn't leave our yard without me or my husband present. There are strangers everywhere these days, and accidents happen in seconds when nobody's watching them.
1085  [sarcastically] Thriving? [Sharp exhale] Last week he rode his bike into traffic chasing a ball! [trembling] What if a car had been coming faster? You can't just hope everything works out when children are involved.
1086  [exasperated] Times have changed! [Bitter laugh] We didn't have registered offenders online or distracted drivers on phones. [pleading] Please, at least consider going to the park with him? Other parents are starting to notice and talk.
1087  [hurt] Helicopter parenting? [voice cracking] I'm protecting my child! [more intensely] When something terrible happens—and statistics show it will—you'll wish you'd been more careful. Safety isn't negotiable when it comes to our babies.
1088  [shakily] Mental health matters, yes, but so does physical safety. [growing firmer] There's a middle ground here. [Frustrated groan] Why not gradual independence with check-ins? Start with supervised freedom, then slowly expand their boundaries as they mature?
1089  [relieved] Yes, exactly! [warmer tone] And perhaps our kids could play together sometimes? [hopefully] My Sarah needs more outdoor time, honestly. She's always asking to join Tommy's adventures but I've been too worried.
1090  [hesitant] I suppose we could try that. [steadying] But ground rules first—no tree climbing above ten feet, no leaving the park boundaries. [quickly] And they both need phones or watches to contact us immediately.
1091  [defensively] We'll see about that. [softer] I admit, she has been asking for more independence lately. [Nervous laugh] Maybe I have been a bit overprotective. It's just so hard to let go sometimes.
1092  [resigned] Saturday at ten it is. [more firmly] But I'm bringing hand sanitizer and a first aid kit. [Slight laugh] And don't judge me if I hover for the first few visits, okay?
1093  [cheerfully] Good afternoon! I can definitely help you with that. [reassuring] Let me just pull up your account—can you provide your customer ID number? [more gently] Detection zones are basically areas where you want the camera to specifically monitor for motion, like your driveway or walkway.
1094  [acknowledging] Perfect, I've got your account here, thank you. [explaining patiently] The camera can see everything in its 160-degree field of view, but you can create up to 5 customizable zones. [more enthusiastically] This helps reduce false alerts from, say, trees swaying or cars passing on the street.
1095  [sympathetically] Oh, that sounds really frustrating, I'm sorry about that. [helpfully] Let's set up your zones right now through the app—do you have version 3.2.1 installed? [more specifically] We'll create zones just for your property boundaries at 42 Maple Street.
1096  [reassuring tone] No, no, don't worry, it's actually quite intuitive once you know how. [instructively] Each zone, Z1 through Z5, can be shaped by dragging the corners to cover specific areas. [more clearly] Think of it like drawing a box around only the areas you care about monitoring.
1097  [approvingly] Excellent work! You're getting the hang of it. [thoughtfully] The 75% sensitivity is our default, but for driveways I usually recommend dropping it to about 60% to avoid triggering from small animals. [chuckles softly] Unless you want alerts every time a squirrel runs by.
1098  [enthusiastically] Great question! Package detection is actually a separate AI feature that works within your zones. [explaining] Once you enable it in settings under PD-001, it'll specifically look for package-shaped objects. [more detailed] It's especially useful if you get lots of deliveries to 42 Maple Street.
1099  [quickly] That's normal for the premium features—check your email for code starting with VER-. [helpfully] It should have been sent to the email on file when you registered your SG2K-4B7X yesterday. [reassuring] Sometimes it goes to spam, so check there too.
1100  [pleased] Wonderful! You've done a fantastic job setting everything up. [informatively] Just remember, it takes about 24-48 hours for the AI to learn your specific property patterns at 42 Maple. [more gently] So you might still get a few extra alerts initially.
1101  [warmly] Yes, that's your permanent customer ID, keep that handy. [professionally] I'm also sending you our quick reference guide to your email—document QRG-2024-ZONES. [cheerfully] It has pictures showing different zone setup examples that might help even more.
1102  [confidently] Absolutely! Just toggle the zone on or off using the switches next to Z1 through Z5 in your app. [reassuringly] Your settings stay saved, so you can reactivate anytime. [friendly closing] Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your SmartGuard Pro 2000 today?
1103  [professionally] Good afternoon, Riverside Credit Union, this is Sarah speaking. [quickly] How may I assist you with your account today?
1104  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir. [briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—could you provide me your member number and last name please? [more reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out for you.
1105  [quickly] Thank you Mr. Morrison, I'm seeing your application here. [pause] [concerned] It appears there was a—well, a discrepancy with your employment verification form. [more gently] Our underwriting team sent a request for additional documentation last Tuesday.
1106  [defensively] Let me check the contact log here... [rapidly] Shows we sent it to the email on file ending in gmail-dot-com. [more carefully] Sometimes these messages do end up in spam folders unfortunately.
1107  [optimistically] Actually, Mr. Morrison, I can help expedite this. [speaking faster] If you can email those documents within the next hour, I'll personally walk them to underwriting. [firmly] We offer priority processing for time-sensitive closings.
1108  [reassuringly] No additional charge for members in your situation, sir. [briskly] Just need the updated pay stubs from the last sixty days and a letter from HR confirming your position. [more warmly] I'll stay on to confirm receipt.
1109  [efficiently] Use loans-urgent at riverside-c-u dot org—that comes straight to me. [quickly] Put your member number in the subject line, and I'll confirm within five minutes of receiving them. [encouragingly] We'll make this deadline work.
1110  [professionally] That's what we're here for, Mr. Morrison. [speaking rapidly] Once I receive your documents, underwriting typically takes twenty-four hours for priority cases. [confidently] You should have your approval letter by Wednesday morning latest.
1111  [firmly] I'll personally monitor your application through completion. [quickly] My direct extension is 4-5-2 if you need anything, and I'm here until six-thirty today. [more reassuringly] We've handled tighter deadlines than this successfully.
1112  [briskly] And... perfect, just received them Mr. Morrison. [enthusiastically] Everything looks complete—I'm walking these to underwriting right now while we're still on the phone. Expect an update by tomorrow afternoon.
1113  [Sad] I don't—I don't understand, you said the tests were just routine, right? [Slow] This can't be happening.
1114  [Angry] No, no, you've gotta be looking at someone else's results because I feel completely fine! [Fast] Check again!
1115  [Whisper] Um, should I... should I call my wife now or wait until I get home? [Sigh]
1116  [Disappointed] [Slow] So all those years of eating kale and running marathons were just—what, pointless?
1117  [Happy] Wait, you're joking, right? [Laugh] This is like one of those hidden camera things my kids watch!
1118  [Fast] Okay so how long do I have to—actually, don't answer that yet, I need a minute. [Groan]
1119  [Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect timing, really, 'cause I just booked a non-refundable cruise. [Tsk]
1120  [Sad] My mom went through this same thing and she, um... [Whisper] she didn't make it.
1121  [Shout] I want a second opinion! [Angry] I want three opinions, actually!
1122  [Slow] Can you just, like, explain it again but use smaller words this time? [Disappointed] I'm kinda lost here.
1123  [Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Sarcastic] I literally just paid off my student loans yesterday—thirty years of payments.
1124  [Fast] [Whisper] Is this the kind of thing where I gotta quit my job or can I still work?
1125  [Sad] I promised my daughter I'd walk her down the aisle and she's not even engaged yet. [Sigh]
1126  [Angry] This is—no, I'm gonna sue somebody, the insurance company or whoever missed this! [Groan]
1127  [Happy] Honestly? [Chuckle] Part of me is relieved 'cause at least now I know why I've been feeling so weird.
1128  [Slow] [Disappointed] So basically you're telling me Christmas might be... different this year, huh?
1129  [Whisper] I haven't even told my kids about the divorce yet and now there's—God, this is too much. [Tsk]
1130  [Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, sure, let's just pile it all on at once, why not throw in a meteor strike while we're at it?
1131  [Sad] But Doctor, I just turned thirty, I mean, this isn't supposed to happen to people like—to people my age. [Slow]
1132  [Shout] Don't touch me! [Angry] [Fast] I need to get out of here, I can't breathe in this stupid little room!
1133  [casual] So you know how Sarah's been posting like twenty Instagram stories a day about her juice cleanse? [light laugh] I finally just— I unfollowed her. Like, I still follow her main account, but I muted her stories because I cannot see one more photo of green sludge, you know? [conversational] And then of course I got curious, right? Like, does she notice when people unfollow? So I may have... checked her follower count a couple times today. [sheepish] Which is ridiculous, I know, but I was bored. [a bit concerned] But then I noticed she unfollowed me back? Which, okay, fine, whatever, that's fair I guess. People notice these things apparently. [more worried] And I'm scrolling through Twitter and— oh wait. [pause] Wait, hold on, she just posted something. "Some people really show their true colors when you're trying to better yourself." [nervous laugh] [anxious] That's— that's about me, right? Oh god, that's definitely about me. The timing is too weird. She's subtweeting about unfollowing her stupid juice stories! [spiraling] [groan] Why did I even do that? Now I look like some bitter friend who can't handle her wellness journey or whatever. This is so much worse than just seeing the smoothie posts! Ugh, I've become Instagram drama! [exasperated] Over juice!
1134  Oh god. Oh no no no. I—okay, I can explain. I was having coffee with her and she was worried about you and I just—I accidentally mentioned it without thinking.
1135  I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But we were talking about stress and work and she was saying how concerned she was and it just... slipped out. [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever.
1136  You're right. You're completely right and I—there's no excuse. I broke your trust and that's... that's not okay. I shouldn't have said anything no matter what.
1137  I know you did. And I—honestly, I've been feeling sick about it since it happened. Like, the second the words left my mouth I wanted to take them back. I tried to kinda backtrack but she'd already heard and—that doesn't matter. I messed up.
1138  No! No, absolutely not. This was—I swear this was a one-time stupid mistake. [nervous laugh] I mean, not that that makes it better. But I don't go around sharing your stuff, I promise.
1139  That's... that's fair. I don't—I guess you can't right now, can you? Um, all I can say is that I've never done this before and I'll never, ever do it again. Your mom just caught me off guard and I wasn't thinking.
1140  Oh jesus. That's—ugh, I'm so sorry. Do you want me to talk to her? Like, I could tell her I was wrong or—actually no, that's probably a terrible idea. I just wanna fix this somehow.
1141  Yeah. Yeah, you're right. [sigh] I just... I hate that I did this to you. You trusted me with something personal and I—I completely blew it. I understand if you don't wanna talk to me for a while.
1142  I know. And I made it weird with literally the worst possible person—your mom. That's... god, I'm such an idiot. You needed that safe space and I just—I ruined it. I'm really, really sorry.
1143  That's okay. Take—take whatever time you need, alright? I'm gonna... I'm gonna be here when you're ready. And I promise—like really promise—nothing like this will ever happen again. I learned my lesson, believe me.
1144  I know, I know, okay? I've been—look, I've been going through some stuff and I just... I didn't wanna drag you into it. That's not me being a bad friend, that's me trying to protect you from my mess.
1145  It wasn't—I didn't disappear, I just needed space. And honestly? You're kinda proving why I didn't reach out. Like, I'm barely keeping it together and now I gotta defend myself for not being social enough? [scoff] That's exactly what I was trying to avoid.
1146  Well I'm—I'm sorry you worried, but I posted on Instagram like, last week. You knew I was alive. I just wasn't ready to talk to anyone and that's... that's allowed, y'know?
1147  What was I supposed to say? "Hey, I'm too depressed to function but don't worry about it"? That's—come on, that's not how it works. Sometimes you can't explain what's going on until you're through it. [sigh] I'm still not through it, honestly.
1148  No, that's not—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. Look look, I get that you're hurt, okay? But I literally couldn't handle talking to anyone. It wasn't personal, it wasn't about you.
1149  Yeah well, imagine how it feels knowing your best friend is mad at you for having depression. Like—I'm sorry I couldn't perform friendship correctly while my brain was basically attacking me. Really sorry about that inconvenience.
1150  Do what? Point out that you're making my mental health about you? Because that's—that's kinda what's happening here. [frustrated laugh] I needed help, not another person to disappoint.
1151  Because I couldn't! I couldn't even shower some days, you think I had the energy to explain what was wrong? I'm barely explaining it now and you're already—whatever, you're already upset with me anyway.
1152  Would you though? Because right now it seems like you don't. You're acting like I chose this, like I wanted to push everyone away. Nobody—nobody wants to feel like this, trust me.
1153  I'm not okay. I'm really not. But I'm trying, and I thought—I dunno, I thought when I finally did reach out, you'd be glad to hear from me, not... this. Guess I waited too long.
1154  [muttering] Okay, so I need to, um— I need to send this email, but does this sound... I don't know, does this sound weird? "I hope this finds you well." That's— that's normal, right? [slightly uncertain] Actually, wait, let me— let me read this again. "As per our previous conversation..." Hmm. [tsk] That sounds, um, that sounds kind of snotty? Like, "as per"— who says "as per"? I mean, I do, apparently, but— [faster, second-guessing] Maybe I should just say "like we talked about" instead? But that's too casual for, uh, for Janet from accounting. She's very— she's very proper. Very, um, very email-formal. [drawn out, conflicted] But "I wanted to follow up" sounds like I'm being pushy, right? Like, aggressive? I don't want to be that person who's like, constantly— constantly poking people about stuff. [resigned, quieter] You know what? I'm overthinking this. It's just— it's just an email about the quarterly reports. Janet's not gonna, um, she's not gonna psychoanalyze my word choices. [exhale] Probably. [decisive but still uncertain] Okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna send it. It's fine. It's, uh, it's professional. That's... that's what matters, right?
1155  [gruff] Oh. You're Rachel's kid. [clearing throat] She said you'd be here but I thought— [trailing off] Look, I'm just grabbing my jacket, alright? Your mom and I have reservations at seven.
1156  [defensive] Grumpy? [short laugh] That's rich. [mumbling] I prefer realistic. Kid, life isn't all rainbows and— [pause] Whatever. Where'd your mother go anyway? We're going to be late.
1157  [strained] That's my daughter, Emma. [quieter] She lives with her mother now. [bitter chuckle] And no, she's more into soccer these days. [sigh] Unicorns are apparently too babyish for twelve-year-olds.
1158  [uncomfortable grunt] It's complicated, alright? [gentler] Emma has her own schedule with— [sharp exhale] Look, you seem nice, but this isn't really something I discuss with... [pause] How old are you anyway?
1159  [surprised] You want to learn about cars? [warming slightly] Well, that's... different. [thoughtful hum] Most kids your age just want screens. [clearer] Maybe I could show you something simple, like checking oil.
1160  [amused snort] When you actually want to, huh? [more serious] Sounds familiar. Emma was the same way. [nostalgic sigh] Fine, Saturday morning, but only if your mom agrees. And wear old clothes.
1161  [awkward pause] Dave's fine, kid. [muttering] Mr. Peterson is my father. [louder, resigned] Or my ex-father-in-law, technically. [dry laugh] Just Dave. Keep it simple, less complicated that way, trust me.
1162  [embarrassed cough] That's... [softer] that's nice to know. [nervous chuckle] Don't tell her you told me that though, alright? [more firmly] Sometimes adults like to keep certain things to themselves, understand?
1163  [mortified] You saw that?! [defeated groan] Christ, I mean— crud. [flustered] That was just... I was checking if I had food in my teeth, obviously. [mumbling quickly] Very important dental hygiene stuff.
1164  [long exhale] You're something else, you know that? [gentler tone] Reminds me of Emma at that age. [quiet admission] Always calling me out on my nonsense. [regular volume] Fine, I'll work on the smiling thing.
1165  [professionally] I'm sorry to hear about the damage, sir. [sympathetic] Let me pull up your account—847-B-2319, correct? [typing tone] I see you're at 4521 Oakwood Drive, and yes, we did have an outage in your area between 11:30 PM and 2:15 AM.
1166  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Henderson. [calmly] According to our records, an automated message was sent at 10:47 PM to all affected customers. [hesitant] Did you perhaps not receive notification code MSG-78294-X on your registered phone?
1167  [reassuring] Your loyalty is absolutely valued, sir, and I want to help resolve this. [measured tone] For surge-related claims, you'll need to file form SC-1147 within 30 days. [helpfully] I can email that to you right now, or would you prefer receiving it by mail?
1168  [carefully] Each claim is evaluated individually based on the circumstances. [more quietly] Between us though, if you have receipts and the items were less than 5 years old... [professionally again] The review process typically takes 10-15 business days after we receive your completed documentation.
1169  [concerned] Oh, that's a medical necessity situation. [urgently] Let me transfer you immediately to our Priority Services at extension 4412. [warmly] They can expedite everything and possibly provide same-day temporary equipment—please hold while I connect you directly to supervisor Martinez.
1170  [cheerfully] Hello, thanks for contacting ParkEZ support! [quickly] I see you're reaching out about a meter issue. [more gently] Could you tell me what's happening—are you having trouble starting your session?
1171  [apologetically] Oh, I understand how frustrating that must be. [briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick—what's the meter number you're trying to use? [reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out right away.
1172  [quickly] I'm checking meter 4782 now, and—hmm—it looks like there might be a sync issue. [more slowly] Sometimes the meter needs a hard reset. [helpfully] Have you tried entering your plate without any spaces or dashes?
1173  [sympathetically] I completely understand your urgency, really. [more quickly] Here's what I can do—I'm manually activating a two-hour session for you right now. [efficiently] You should see the confirmation in about... fifteen seconds.
1174  [warmly] Job interview—oh wow, good luck with that! [chuckles softly] I've also added a credit to your account for the inconvenience. [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with before you run?
1175  [Soft] Hey, um, I know we don't know each other, but are you—are you okay? [Sad] Do you need someone to just, like, sit here with you?
1176  [Fast] I've got tissues in my bag somewhere, hold on, let me just— [Chuckle] I'm basically a walking pharmacy, my mom always said I overpack.
1177  [Whisper] You don't have to talk about it if you don't wanna, okay? [Sigh] Sometimes it just helps to not be alone.
1178  [Happy] My therapist says crying is, like, literally the body's way of healing itself, so you're actually doing great right now! [Laugh]
1179  [Slow] Whatever happened, it's gonna— [Tsk] I mean, I know everyone says that, but things really do get easier.
1180  [Disappointed] God, people can be so cruel sometimes, can't they? [Sad] I'm sorry you're going through this, whatever it is.
1181  [Sarcastic] Well, this bench has definitely seen worse days than yours, trust me. [Chuckle] I once saw a guy propose here and get rejected, so...
1182  [Angry] Hey, did someone hurt you? [Fast] 'Cause I will absolutely go have words with them right now if you need me to.
1183  [Sad] I remember crying in public once and this stranger bought me coffee, so, um— [Soft] Can I get you something from that café over there?
1184  [Shout] You know what? [Happy] Screw whoever made you feel this way—you deserve so much better than this!
1185  [Whisper] It's okay to just let it all out, honestly. [Sigh] [Slow] I'm not going anywhere unless you want me to.
1186  [Fast] Oh god, I'm being weird, aren't I? [Laugh] I just saw you and I couldn't just walk by without—sorry, I'll leave if you want.
1187  [Disappointed] The world kinda sucks right now, doesn't it? [Tsk] But hey, at least we've got, um, nice weather today?
1188  [Slow] You're being really brave, you know? [Sad] Most people would've just gone home, but you're here, dealing with it.
1189  [Sarcastic] I mean, if it helps, my day's been absolute garbage too. [Groan] We can form a little pity party right here.
1190  [Happy] Actually, there's this breathing technique that's supposed to— [Fast] Wait, sorry, you probably don't want advice right now, never mind.
1191  [Angry] [Shout] Nobody should have to feel this alone! [Soft] Look, I'm a complete stranger but I actually give a damn, okay?
1192  [Whisper] Do you want me to call someone for you? [Sad] Like, a friend or family member who could—I dunno, just thinking out loud.
1193  [Chuckle] This is gonna sound stupid, but my grandma always said tears water the flowers of tomorrow or something. [Sigh] She was better at this stuff than me.
1194  [Slow] Hey, I gotta catch my train soon, but— [Disappointed] I really hope things get better for you, like, genuinely.
1195  [casual] Oh my god, you know what's, um, what's embarrassing? I have this tab that's been open on my laptop for like— like three weeks now? Maybe more? [light laugh] I don't even, uh, I don't even remember what it is anymore, but I just— I just keep it there, you know? Like it's become part of the, um, the landscape at this point. [conversational] It's like having a, uh, a weird digital pet or something. I see it every day and I'm like "oh hey, mystery tab, how's it going?" [chuckle] But I never actually, um, never actually click on it because what if it's something really boring? Like what if it's just— I don't know, like a, uh, a recipe for banana bread that I'll never make? [slightly curious] But okay, you know what? I'm— I'm gonna look right now. I'm curious. Let me just— [pause] let me just click on this thing and see what, um, what past me thought was so important that I— [realization dawning] Oh. Oh no. Wait, this is— [sharp exhale] this is the, uh, the registration form. For the conference. The one that was— oh god, when was the deadline? Let me just— [panic building] It was yesterday! The deadline was yesterday! I've been staring at this stupid tab for three weeks and it was the— the one thing I actually needed to do! [groan] I'm such an idiot! How do I— how do I even function as a human being? [spiraling] [frustrated laugh] Three weeks! I could have done it any day for three weeks and instead I just— I just let it sit there like some kind of, of digital decoration! [defeated] I'm never gonna get into this conference now. This is— this is peak me right here.
1196  I—okay, I know you're mad, but it literally just came up. We were all talking about work stuff and Jake mentioned his interview at the same company and I just—it slipped out, alright?
1197  Yes! It slipped out! I didn't wake up planning to tell everyone about your—about what happened. They were all sharing their worst interview stories and I mentioned yours without thinking. [Sigh] I realize now that wasn't cool, but...
1198  But you're acting like I maliciously went around gossiping about you, which is—that's not what happened. At all. I mean, come on, we've been friends for how long? You really think I'd do that to you?
1199  No, I—ugh, that's not the same thing and you know it. There's a difference between accidentally mentioning something in conversation and like, deliberately spreading your business around. I'm not saying I handled it perfectly, but [frustrated laugh] you're being kinda unfair here.
1200  Okay okay, look—I get that sucks. I do. But once it was out there, what was I supposed to do? Tell everyone to forget I said it? That would've just made it into a bigger thing, y'know?
1201  Yeah, well, I can't—I can't go back in time, can I? I messed up, fine, but honestly? You've shared stuff about me before too. Remember when you told Amy about my breakup while it was still happening?
1202  How? How is that different? Because—no, seriously, explain to me how that's different. You "accidentally" told her I got dumped at my birthday dinner, and I had to deal with her pity texts for weeks.
1203  That's not—[groan] I'm not trying to keep score here. I'm just saying maybe you could cut me some slack since I've literally never done this before and it wasn't on purpose.
1204  I mean, it kinda does though? Like, intent matters. I wasn't trying to hurt you or—or make you look bad. Everyone was bonding over their failures and I thought... I dunno, I thought it would help normalize it or something.
1205  You know what? Fine. Be mad. But I'm kinda disappointed that after everything, you can't even—whatever. I said I'm sorry, I explained what happened. If you wanna stay pissed at me forever over one mistake, that's... that's on you.
1206  Wait wait wait—that's not what happened. I was talking about my own shit, okay? Like, I was literally explaining why I've been so anxious lately and yeah, I mentioned that we both go to therapy but—
1207  I didn't share your stuff though! I was talking about me, about how I've been struggling with the same things. You're making it sound like I just [scoff] randomly brought up your personal business, which isn't what happened at all.
1208  That's—okay, that's not fair. I needed to talk to someone too, y'know? And I thought—I dunno, I thought mentioning we were both working through stuff would make it less... weird or whatever. I wasn't gossiping about you.
1209  Yeah, maybe. But honestly? It's kinda hard when we've been going through this together. Like, you're acting like I betrayed you when I was literally just trying to explain my own situation. [frustrated laugh] I mean, come on.
1210  So what? Seriously, so what? Half our friend group is in therapy—it's not like it's this big shameful secret. And I'm sorry if you wanted to keep it private, I am, but you're treating me like I'm some kind of—like I did this to hurt you.
1211  Actually, yeah, it kinda does matter? Like, there's a difference between me maliciously spreading your business and me mentioning—in passing—while talking about my own mental health, that we both see therapists. That's—those are two completely different things.
1212  Okay okay, fine. I get that you're upset. But I'm also—look, I'm disappointed too, alright? Because I thought you'd understand that I wasn't trying to violate your trust. I was having a really shit day and I needed to vent.
1213  That's not—[sigh] I didn't throw you under anything. You're being so dramatic about this. I literally said "yeah, we both started going around the same time" and that was it. I didn't share what you talk about or why you go or—nothing like that.
1214  Maybe not. Fine. But you know what? You're not being a great friend right now either. Like, you haven't even asked why I was upset enough to need to talk to Marcus in the first place. It's just all about you and how I wronged you.
1215  Yeah, well—I'm sorry it came out, okay? I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna apologize for needing support too. And honestly? If you can't see the difference between what I did and actually betraying you, then I dunno what to tell you.
1216  That's not—I never said it like that. I'm trying to help you move forward, okay? There's a difference between minimizing and, like, trying to help you not stay stuck in this forever.
1217  No, it's really not though. Look look, I've been listening to you talk about this for months—which I'm happy to do—but at some point, y'know, dwelling on it isn't helping anymore. [frustrated laugh] That's all I'm saying.
1218  I didn't—come on, don't twist my words. I'm just saying maybe it's time to, I dunno, try something different? Because what you're doing now obviously isn't working.
1219  Okay okay, see, this is what I mean. I literally can't say anything without you getting—I'm trying here. I am. But you're acting like I'm the bad guy for suggesting you might wanna, like, actually heal from this.
1220  I'm not deciding anything! Jesus. I'm just—[sigh]—I'm worried about you, alright? And honestly, it feels like you want to stay angry more than you want to feel better.
1221  What? What's "wow"? You're gonna sit there and tell me you haven't been, like, holding onto this? Fine fine, maybe I shouldn't have said it that way, but somebody needs to.
1222  Then how? Seriously, tell me how I'm supposed to—because I've tried being supportive, I've tried just listening, and now when I suggest maybe trying to move forward, suddenly I'm the worst friend ever?
1223  No, but you—okay, you're right, you didn't. But I'm also allowed to have opinions about watching my best friend basically torture themselves over something that happened six months ago. That's—is that not fair?
1224  For some things, sure. But you're not even trying to—[groan] whatever. You know what? Maybe I am minimizing. Maybe I just don't get it. But I'm also kinda tired of feeling like the bad guy for wanting you to be okay.
1225  Stop what? Stop caring? Stop trying to help? I mean—that's what you want? Because honestly, I dunno what else to do here. I'm sorry if I'm not saying the right things, but I'm not gonna pretend like watching you do this to yourself is easy either.
1226  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I need a snack. I need— I definitely need something because I'm, like, I'm gonna crash in about ten minutes if I don't— [sigh] Alright, what do we got here? [slightly more focused] So there's, um, there's the usual suspects. Chips, obviously. But like, do I want— do I want salty or do I want sweet? Because I had that really bland sandwich for lunch and I'm thinking maybe sweet would be— but then again, uh, salt sounds really good right now. [considering] Ooh, okay, Snickers. Classic. Can't go wrong with— but wait, didn't I just have chocolate yesterday? I feel like I did. I mean, not that there's anything wrong with— [tsk] I'm not on a diet or anything, I just— [second-guessing] Maybe pretzels? Those are like, healthy-ish, right? Well, not healthy but, um, less bad? [laugh] Less bad, great criteria there. Very scientific. But they're so— they're so dry, and I don't have water with me, so— [decisive, then wavering] You know what, Snickers. I'm doing it. I'm— [pause] unless... do they have those trail mix things? The ones with the, uh, the little chocolate bits? [hmm] That's like compromise food. Best of both worlds. [resigned but satisfied] Nah, forget it. Snickers it is. Sometimes you just gotta— you just gotta go with your gut, right? B4. Here we go.
1227  [exasperated] Sweetie, we need to talk about your appearance. [getting louder] The Hendersons are coming for dinner tonight, and you look like you just [pause] [disgusted] rolled out of bed. Could you at least brush your hair?
1228  [high-pitched] Effortless? [incredulous laugh] You look homeless! [whispering urgently] What will they think of our family? Their daughter just got into Yale—she always looks immaculate. Please, just change into something presentable for once.
1229  [hurt tone] Important stuff? [voice breaking] Our reputation IS important! [faster words] I work so hard to maintain our image in this neighborhood, and you're sabotaging everything with your deliberate sloppiness. It's embarrassing!
1230  [defensive shout] That's not true! [quieter] Mrs. Peterson mentioned your appearance at book club last week. [trembling] She said—and I quote—"Your daughter certainly marches to her own drummer." [bitter laugh] Do you know how humiliating that was?
1231  [pleading] Just this once, honey. [softer] Wear the blue dress I bought you—the one with the flowers? [desperately quick] It would mean so much to me. You looked absolutely stunning in it at Easter!
1232  [sarcastic whisper] Jeans without holes, how generous. [building frustration] You know what? When you're thirty and wondering why you never learned proper presentation, [sharp exhale] don't come crying to me about missed opportunities!
1233  [mocking] Steve Jobs? [exasperated groan] You're not building Apple in our garage! [quieter, sadder] I just want you to understand that first impressions matter, sweetheart. The world judges us whether we like it or not.
1234  [defeated] Your own skin. [long sigh] That's all your generation talks about—authenticity, being yourself. [wistful] When I was your age, we understood the value of putting our best foot forward, of trying.
1235  [sudden outburst] Fine! [voice cracking] Wear whatever you want! [more quietly] When the Hendersons whisper about our "alternative" child, I'll just smile and pretend it doesn't slice through me like a knife.
1236  [brightening immediately] Really? You'll wear it? [excited squeal] Oh honey, thank you! [rapidly] You won't regret this—Mrs. Henderson always brings those fancy chocolates, and she's more generous when she's impressed!
1237  [apologetic] Sir, I understand you're upset, and I'm truly sorry this happened. [calmly] Let me pull up your file... R-7834-B, yes, I see it here. [concerned] According to our records, you signed a data waiver form at drop-off.
1238  [defensive] Sir, our standard protocol requires all customers to back up their data before any repair. [more firmly] The form clearly states in section 4-A that we're not responsible for data loss. [sighs] Did you create a backup before bringing it in?
1239  [skeptical] Employee 4492... that's Marcus, he wouldn't have promised that. [matter-of-factly] Our policy at 1247 Riverside Plaza has been the same for three years. [professionally] However, I can offer you a $50 store credit for your inconvenience.
1240  [sympathetically] I genuinely wish there was something more I could do. [hesitant] Let me... let me speak with my manager, Mr. Chen. [more hopefully] Sometimes our advanced tech team can attempt recovery for a fee of $299.
1241  [pleading] Sir, please, let's not escalate this further. [quickly] Actually, wait—I'm seeing here that your device serial J7K9-XX2M might still have a cloud backup from October 14th. [relieved sigh] Can you check your account settings right now?
1242  [professional] Thank you for reaching out, Mr. Henderson. [quickly] I understand you have concerns about your case timeline—let me pull up your file right away. [reassuring] We're here to address any issues you're experiencing.
1243  [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, and you're right to be concerned. [more quickly] The discovery phase has taken longer than anticipated due to, uh, opposing counsel requesting multiple extensions. [firmly] However, we should have depositions scheduled within two weeks.
1244  [calmly] You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the lack of consistent updates. [briskly] Moving forward, we'll implement weekly email briefings every Friday, even if it's just to say nothing has changed. [sincerely] Your case is a priority.
1245  [more firmly] Let me be specific then—depositions are scheduled for March 15th and 17th. [quickly] The motion hearing is set for April 2nd, and barring any unforeseen circumstances, we should have resolution by May. [confidently] These dates are confirmed.
1246  [reassuring] Fair point, and I understand your skepticism. [more briskly] Unforeseen would be things like judge illness or, uh, natural disasters—not routine scheduling conflicts. [emphatically] We've already blocked these dates and notified all parties, so they're locked in.
1247  [quickly] Let me address that immediately—there seems to be a disconnect between our billing and case management systems. [apologetically] The research was completed on time, but the communication about it wasn't properly logged. [firmly] I'll have accounting review and adjust that invoice today.
1248  [sympathetically] I completely understand, and you deserve better service than what you've received. [briskly] Here's what I propose—a 15% discount on this month's billing, plus those weekly updates I mentioned. [confidently] We want to rebuild your trust.
1249  [decisively] You're absolutely right, and effective immediately, I'm your single point of contact. [quickly] My direct line is 555-0147, and I personally oversee every aspect of your case from here out. [earnestly] No more transfers, no more confusion.
1250  [firmly] Absolutely, and in fact, we're filing a motion to compel tomorrow morning. [more quickly] Their delay tactics end now—the judge has already indicated frustration with their behavior. [confidently] We're taking a much more aggressive stance moving forward.
1251  [candidly] Your feedback did, actually—leadership reviewed your case this morning. [briskly] They agreed we've been too accommodating, and frankly, it's hurt your position. [determinedly] That stops today, and we're pushing hard for that May resolution.
1252  [Disappointed] I know I bought it here, I just—I can't find the stupid receipt anywhere, but like, can't you look it up? [Sigh]
1253  [Fast] Okay so basically my dog ate the receipt—no really, I'm serious—and I need to return this because it's broken. [Nervous laugh]
1254  [Sarcastic] Oh great, so you're telling me that without that tiny piece of paper, this is just, what, mine forever? [Tsk]
1255  [Whisper] Between you and me, um, my wife doesn't know I bought this, so I kinda need to—you know. [Slow]
1256  [Happy] You guys have the best return policy though, right? [Laugh] I shop here literally all the time!
1257  [Angry] This is ridiculous—I mean, you can see the price tag's still on it! [Shout] Manager! I need a manager!
1258  [Slow] Look, I'm not trying to scam anyone here, I just, uh, I honestly forgot to keep the receipt. [Sad]
1259  [Fast] Can you maybe check my credit card history or something 'cause I definitely—wait, did I pay cash? [Groan]
1260  [Disappointed] I drove forty-five minutes to get here and now you're gonna—really? [Tsk] This is how you treat customers?
1261  [Sarcastic] Sure, I'll just keep this broken blender that I totally wanted to own forever. [Slow] That's exactly what I had planned. [Sigh]
1262  [Whisper] Is there, like, someone else I could talk to who might be more, um, flexible about this? [Chuckle]
1263  [Happy] Wait wait wait, I think I might have—no, that's a grocery receipt, sorry. [Fast] But I swear I bought it Tuesday!
1264  [Sad] My kid threw it away when he was "helping" clean, and I just—I dunno what else to tell you. [Slow]
1265  [Angry] Every other store does store credit at least! [Fast] This is basically theft at this point, you realize that, right?
1266  [Chuckle] Would it help if I, uh, if I showed you the charge on my bank app? [Happy] See? Seventy-nine ninety-nine!
1267  [Disappointed] So you're saying even though it's literally defective, there's nothing—absolutely nothing—you can do? [Groan]
1268  [Slow] I mean, honestly, I probably spent like three thousand dollars here last year, so... [Sarcastic] But sure, this one time matters. [Tsk]
1269  [Shout] It's still in the original packaging! [Angry] How is this not proof enough that I'm not trying to pull something here?
1270  [Whisper] Look, I'm kinda desperate here—it was supposed to be a gift and it's the wrong size. [Sad] Please?
1271  [Fast] Okay so what if—hear me out—what if I buy something else right now and then return both things together? [Laugh] [Happy]
1272  [matter-of-fact] So I had to have a conversation with my sister today about the whole wedding planning thing. You know how she's been calling me like every other day asking me to help with all these details? [conversational] I finally just told her I needed some space from it. Like, I want to be supportive, but I have my own stuff going on, you know? I was pretty calm about it, just explained that I needed to step back a little. [slightly uncomfortable] Actually, let me think about what I said exactly... [pause] I said, um, "I can't be your unpaid wedding coordinator anymore. You need to figure this out yourself or hire someone." [realizing] Wait, did I really say "unpaid wedding coordinator"? [nervous laugh] That sounds... that sounds kind of harsh now that I'm saying it out loud. [growing concern] And then I said— oh god, I told her she was being "emotionally draining" and that I felt like she only called me when she needed something. [groan] Why did I say it like that? [increasingly anxious] I mean, it's true, but... [sharp exhale] she's planning her wedding! Of course she's stressed! And I just— I basically told my sister she was using me right before the biggest day of her life. [spiraling] [upset] What if I ruined everything? What if she doesn't want me in the wedding anymore? [whimper] Oh my god, I'm the worst sister ever. I should call her back, shouldn't I?
1273  I—okay, yeah, but it's not what you think. I only showed it to Jordan because they were literally going through the exact same thing and I thought—I dunno, I thought it might help them.
1274  Look, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I posted it online or something. It was one person—one—who doesn't even know you. [Sigh] And honestly? They really needed to hear it.
1275  Okay okay, but come on, it's not like I shared anything super personal. It was just the part where you were talking about dealing with anxiety at work—that's it. I cropped out everything else.
1276  Fine, you're right, technically—but can you maybe understand why I did it? Jordan was having a literal breakdown and your words were—they were perfect. [frustrated laugh] I was trying to help someone.
1277  That's—wow, okay, "violating" is a pretty strong word for showing one screenshot to help someone who was crying in my apartment. But sure, make me the villain here.
1278  Yeah, I could've, you're right. But it was like 2 AM and Jordan was—whatever, you don't wanna hear it. I'm sorry I didn't ask, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I was trying to do something good.
1279  I mean, they should count for something though, right? Like, there's a difference between me being careless with your privacy and me deliberately—[Groan] you know what, forget it. You've already decided I'm terrible.
1280  Oh great, disappointed is so much better. Look look, I messed up, I get it. But you're being really—I dunno, rigid about this? Like we've been friends for how long and this is gonna be the thing?
1281  And I respect that, I do, but—okay, honestly? You've shared stuff about me before too. Remember when you told Kyle about my thing with my ex? Without asking? But I didn't make it into this whole production.
1282  Is it though? Is it really? Because from where I'm sitting, we both shared something to help someone else, except I'm the only one getting crucified for it. [Scoff] But yeah, sure, totally different.
1283  [muttering] Okay, so, um, two minutes. Two minutes for leftover pizza. That's— that's not that long, right? I mean, I could, uh, I could probably wait two minutes without, like, completely losing my mind here. [slightly impatient] But I'm so hungry though. Like, really hungry. When did I even eat last? Was it— was it breakfast? Did I have breakfast? [sigh] I feel like I had coffee, but that's not— that's not really food, is it. [drawn out, watching microwave] One minute fifty. Okay. Um, okay, so maybe I should've just eaten it cold? Cold pizza's not that bad, right? People do that. College students do that all the time, so— [faster, second-guessing] No, no, warm pizza is definitely better. Melted cheese and all that. I made the right choice here. I'm just, uh, I'm just being dramatic because I'm hungry and when you're hungry everything takes forever and— [fidgety] One minute twenty. [groan] This is like watching paint dry. Actually, paint probably dries faster than this. Do I have anything else I could— I could grab some crackers or something while I wait? That's not, um, that's not cheating, right? [resigned but lighter] You know what, one minute left. I can do one minute. I'm an adult, I can wait sixty seconds for properly heated food. This is fine.
1284  [sternly] You cannot go to this party with that boy. [voice rising] I don't know his family, his background—nothing! [Sharp exhale] What will people say when they see you alone with him at night?
1285  [incredulous] Other parents? [scoffing] Other parents don't care what happens to their children! [more firmly] We came to this country to give you opportunities, not to watch you throw away your reputation for some boy.
1286  [proudly] Good! Dating is distraction. [quieter] When I was your age, I was studying every night, helping my mother with housework. [accusingly] Now you want to waste time on romance instead of focusing on college applications?
1287  [dismissively] This is living? [bitter laugh] Running around with boys who will forget you next week? [slower pace] In our culture, we date with purpose, with family involvement. Not this American nonsense of "having fun."
1288  [shocked whisper] How can you say that? [emotionally] Everything we do is for you! [voice trembling] But you're forgetting where you come from, becoming like these kids with no respect for family values.
1289  [softer tone] You belong with us, with family. [hesitant] This boy... what does he know about our struggles, our sacrifices? [firmly] American boys, they don't understand commitment. They don't understand real responsibility.
1290  [surprised] He's learning our language? [suspicious] Why didn't you tell me this before? [quick exhale] Still, words are easy. Actions matter more. What are his intentions with you?
1291  [long sigh] Winter formal... [contemplating] With chaperones? [more sternly] And you come home by ten-thirty, no later. I will pick you up myself, and I want to meet this boy first.
1292  [warning tone] This is not permission for dating. [clearer] This is one event, one time. [nervous chuckle] And your aunt will probably have my head when she hears about this decision.
1293  [reluctantly amused] Every hour is too much. [gentler] Every two hours. [deep breath] Maybe I am too strict sometimes, but it's because this world... it's not always kind to young girls, especially our girls.
1294  [firmly] Dr. Martinez, I need to discuss a serious breach of professional boundaries involving my therapist, Dr. Sarah Chen—license number 47B-2019. [pause] She friended me on Facebook last Tuesday, May 14th, and [voice rising] has been commenting on all my personal posts.
1295  [frustrated] It started innocently enough with a friend request around 9:30 PM, but then—[sighs heavily]—she liked seventeen photos from my 2018 vacation. [incredulous] She even commented "Looking great!" on my beach photos, which felt... invasive.
1296  [hesitant] Well, during our last three sessions she kept mentioning her divorce proceedings. [voice breaking] She spent maybe 20 minutes—20 minutes!—of my $175 session talking about her ex-husband Gary. [sarcastically] Really therapeutic for ME, you know?
1297  [defensively] I blocked her immediately after she sent me a private message at 11:47 PM asking if I wanted to grab coffee! [groans] My anxiety is through the roof—isn't she supposed to be helping with that?
1298  [upset] Honestly? I feel betrayed and—[voice shaking]—I don't know if I can trust another therapist here. [bitterly] I've been coming to this clinic since 2021, and now I'm considering filing with the state board, license complaint form 45-C.
1299  [skeptically] How do I know this won't happen again with therapist number—what would this be—four? [sighs] I specifically requested someone experienced when I filled out intake form 12-B, and look where that got me.
1300  [considering] Dr. Wong... I've heard good things about him from the support group that meets Wednesdays. [cautiously hopeful] If you're personally guaranteeing oversight with your supervisor license—SV-8823, right?—then maybe I'll give it one more try.
1301  [relieved] Thank you for taking this seriously, unlike the office manager who said I was "overreacting" yesterday. [more firmly] I want everything documented though—every incident from May 14th through today, May 21st.
1302  [tired] Employee 10847—Rebecca something—she practically rolled her eyes at me. [sighs deeply] I just want to feel safe in therapy again, you know? [quietly] Is that too much to ask for my mental health investment?
1303  [gratefully] I appreciate you listening and actually doing something about this mess. [pause] [cautiously] Will Dr. Chen still have access to my files—all those notes from our 23 sessions?
1304  [briskly] Thank you for calling Extended Shield Warranty Services, how can I— [pause] yes, I see your claim here. [more quickly] Unfortunately, your transmission failure isn't covered under your basic powertrain plan.
1305  [apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, really, but [speaking faster] the CVT transmission in your vehicle falls under a different category— [clears throat] it's specifically excluded on page forty-seven of your contract.
1306  [defensively] It's not useless, sir, it covers many components like— [quickly rattling off] water pumps, alternators, starter motors. [more firmly] Just not continuously variable transmissions manufactured after 2018.
1307  [mechanically] I can transfer you to our retention department who might— [speeding up] they sometimes have upgrade options available. [sighs] Though I should mention there's a ninety-day waiting period for pre-existing issues.
1308  [offended] Sir, I don't work from a script, I'm trying to— [more quickly] Look, let me check with my supervisor. [hesitantly] Sometimes we can file an exception for long-term customers.
1309  [hurriedly] The supervisor says we can offer a one-time courtesy credit of— [pause] five hundred dollars toward your repair. [apologetically] It's not full coverage, but it's something we don't normally do.
1310  [sympathetically] I really wish I could do more, but— [speaking quickly] the underwriters set these limits, not me. [sighs heavily] Have you considered our platinum plan for future coverage?
1311  [defensively] That's not what I— [pause] [more calmly] Sir, I'm documenting everything in your file for the review board. Sometimes they overturn initial decisions within five business days.
1312  [quickly] I'll email those forms right now, and— [more enthusiastically] actually, I just noticed you might qualify for our hardship provision. [cautiously] It requires additional documentation though.
1313  [rapidly] Three months of bank statements, two repair estimates, and— [pause] [apologetically] a notarized affidavit stating this failure impacts your ability to work. [more hopefully] But it could increase coverage to seventy percent.
1314  [Disappointed] Yeah, I get it, Sarah's the smart one—I've only heard that, like, a thousand times before. [Sigh]
1315  [Angry] [Fast] Stop, just stop comparing us, okay? We're different people with different—God, why do I even bother explaining this anymore?
1316  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another story about my brother's promotion, how refreshing and not at all predictable. [Tsk]
1317  [Sad] [Slow] I mean, I try so hard, but it's never... it's just never enough, you know?
1318  [muttering] Come on, come on... how long has this been red? I swear I've been standing here for, like, um, for like five minutes already. Which is probably not true, but it, uh, it feels like five minutes. [slightly impatient] Okay, so there's no cars coming from that direction, and there's no cars coming from— I mean, there's literally nobody here. Why can't I just— but no, no, that's how you get hit by a car, right? The one car you don't see. [resigned] Plus there's probably, um, there's probably a camera or something watching, and I'll be that person who, uh, who jaywalks and then immediately gets a ticket. [sigh] That would be so typical. [brightening slightly] Oh wait, is that— no, still red. I thought I saw it, um, I thought I saw it flicker or something, but... [hmm] maybe it's broken? Do traffic lights break? I mean, they must, right? [casual acceptance] Whatever, I'm not in a rush anyway. I've got, like, nowhere important to be. Just gonna stand here and, uh, and wait like a responsible adult. [exhale] Look at me being all patient and stuff.
1319  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I need something to listen to while I— while I do the dishes. But what do I, uh— what do I actually want to hear right now? [sigh] I've got like fifty things in my queue and I can never, um, I can never decide. [slightly overwhelmed] There's that true crime one, but it's, uh, it's kind of heavy for a Tuesday morning, you know? And then there's the, um— the comedy one, but I'm like three episodes behind and I feel like I'm gonna be lost if I just jump in. [tsk] Why do I do this to myself? [brightening slightly] Oh, wait, what about that new one? The, uh, the food one that Sarah recommended? But is it— is it actually good or is it just, like, trendy right now? [hmm] I hate when I pick something and then it's boring and I'm stuck with, um, with dishes and boredom. [resigned but decisive] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna hit shuffle on the comedy ones. Even if I'm behind, it's not like, uh, it's not like there's some complex plot I'm missing. [laugh] Problem solved. Sort of.
1320  [muttering] Okay, so, um— did I lock the door? I feel like I locked it, but, uh, but now I'm not— I'm not totally sure. I always lock it, right? Like, that's just, um, that's just what I do. [slightly uncertain] But I was, uh, I was rushing this morning because of the, um, the thing with my coffee maker, and I had to— I had to use the French press instead, which took forever, and then I was like, oh crap, I'm gonna be— [faster, working through it] Wait wait wait. Let me just— let me think about this. I grabbed my keys, I walked to the door, I opened it, stepped out, and then I— did I turn around? I feel like I turned around, but maybe I was just, uh, maybe I was just thinking about turning around? [frustrated sigh] [more animated] This is— this is so annoying. Like, why can't I just remember doing something I literally do every single day? It's muscle memory, it should be— [tsk] I mean, it's not like it's complicated. [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna assume I did it. Because I always do it, and, um, and statistically speaking, I probably— yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's fine. Probably.
1321  [muttering] Okay, so, um— should I just send it? I mean, it's not that bad, right? It's just, uh, it's just a little joke about what happened at lunch, and like— like, maybe they'll think it's funny? Or maybe they'll think I'm, um, I'm totally weird for bringing it up again. [slightly nervous] But I mean, we were laughing about it, so that's— that's a good sign, right? Right? [sigh] God, why is this so— why do I always overthink these things? It's literally just a text. People send texts all the time. [faster] Okay, but what if they don't respond? What if they think I'm being too, um, too forward or something? Because we don't really text that much, and this is kind of— it's kind of random, isn't it? [hesitant] Unless... unless it's not that random? I mean, they did give me their number, so they probably— they probably want me to use it, right? [hmm] That's how numbers work. [decisive, then wavering] You know what? I'm just gonna— I'm gonna send it. Life's too short to, uh, to worry about every little— [pause] or maybe I should wait until tomorrow? [resigned] Ugh, okay, no. Sending it now before I, um, before I chicken out completely.
1322  [muttering] Oh, come on. Five percent? Really? I just— I just checked this like an hour ago and it was at, um, it was at like thirty something. How does it just— [sigh] how does it just disappear like that? [slightly panicked] Okay, so, um, charger. Where's my— where's my charger? It's not in my bag, it's not— did I leave it at work? Oh god, please don't tell me I left it at work because that means I'm gonna be, like, completely cut off for the rest of the— [thinking out loud] Wait, okay, let me just— let me just think about this logically. I could, um, I could ask someone? But that's so awkward, like, "hey, can I borrow your charger" and then I'm just, uh, I'm just tethered to their wall for like an hour. [resigned] Or I could just— I could just let it die. I mean, people survived without phones for, like, thousands of years, right? It's not gonna kill me to be unreachable for a few hours. Probably. [second-guessing] But what if someone needs to— what if there's an emergency or something important and I just— [groan] why didn't I charge it last night?
1323  [muttering] Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, five minutes? Ten? I plugged it in and then I— I don't know, I got distracted by, uh, by whatever. [sigh] Come on, phone. Just— just give me something here. [slightly impatient] I mean, it was completely dead, so that's— that's on me, I guess. But like, shouldn't there be enough juice by now to at least, um, to at least turn on? Even for like two seconds? [tsk] I just need to check if— if Sarah texted me back about tonight. [hopeful] Let me just— let me try pressing the button again. Maybe it'll— [pause] nope. Still nothing. Just that stupid black screen judging me for my, uh, for my poor charging habits. Which, okay, fair enough. [resigned but chatty] I should probably just, um, just leave it alone for like ten more minutes, right? That's what normal people would do. Patient people. But I'm not— I'm clearly not patient people because here I am talking to a dead phone like it's gonna, uh, like it's gonna suddenly care about my schedule. [trailing off] Maybe I should find a book or something. Do I even— do I even remember how to just... sit? Without scrolling? [laugh] This is gonna be interesting.
1324  [muttering] Oh, you've got to be— you've got to be kidding me. The, um, the speaker I bought yesterday is literally— it's literally forty percent off today. Forty percent! [sigh] I mean, what are the, uh, what are the odds? [slightly incredulous] I was so proud of myself too, like, "Oh good job, you actually, um, you actually did the research this time." Looked at reviews, compared prices, the whole— the whole thing. And now it's, uh— [groan] now it's basically half price. [faster, working through it] Okay, so, um, so what can I do here? I could return it, right? But then I'd have to, uh, I'd have to drive all the way back, wait in that line again, and then— and then rebuy the exact same thing? That seems, um, that seems kind of ridiculous. [contemplative] I mean, it's not like I— it's not like I can't afford it. It's just the principle, you know? Like, why does this always— why does this always happen to me? [tsk] It's like the universe has, um, has terrible timing. [resigned, trailing off] Whatever. I guess that's just... that's just how it goes. The speaker works fine, I like it, so, um... I'll just pretend I never saw the sale. Right. Easy enough.
1325  [muttering] Okay, so, um, serving size is— let me just— [sigh] why is this so tiny? Like, servings per container... two and a half? Two and a half servings in this little, uh, this little bag of chips that I could literally finish in like five minutes. [slightly exasperated] So wait, if there's, um, if there's 150 calories per serving, and there's two and a half servings, then that's— that's what, like 375 calories total? For this tiny— [huh] that seems like a lot for something this small. [slower, working it out] But okay, so if I eat, like, half the bag, that would be... one and a quarter servings? So that's, um, 150 times— no wait, that's not— [tsk] why can't I just do math in my head anymore? [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna eat some chips and not think about it too hard. Like, it's not that serious, right? It's just— it's just a snack. [trailing off] Although I guess I should probably... I mean, if I'm trying to—
1326  [carefully measured] Okay, so, um, don't touch anything. Don't touch anything for, like, what did she say— ten minutes? Fifteen? I should've, uh, I should've asked how long exactly, but— [slightly annoyed] [sigh] Why do I always do this? Like, I always paint my nails right before I need to, um, need to do stuff. It's like my brain just— just doesn't plan ahead or something. [muttering] Okay, so what can I do that doesn't involve my, uh, my hands? I mean, I could watch TV, but the remote is— the remote's over there and I'd have to, like, carefully grab it with my, um, with my knuckles or whatever. [thoughtful] Maybe I should just, like, sit here and meditate or something. Be zen about it. Just, uh, just embrace the stillness. [snort] Yeah right, like I'm gonna meditate. [resigned] I could call my mom, but then I'd have to hold the phone and— wait, no, speaker phone. [huh] Actually that's not a terrible idea. [trailing off] Or I could just, um, just sit here and think about stuff for once. When do I ever just... sit and think about—
1327  [muttering] Come on, come on, just— just load already. I mean, it's not like I'm asking for, um, for something crazy here, it's just— [sigh] it's just a basic webpage, right? [slightly impatient] Okay, so the little spinny thing is, uh, it's still spinning, which means it's trying, I guess? But like, how long does it— how long does it actually take to load one page? This wifi is supposed to be, um, it's supposed to be decent. [drawn out] Maybe I should, uh— maybe I should refresh? No wait, that's— that's probably gonna make it worse, right? Like, starting over from scratch when it's already, um, it's already trying to— [brightening slightly] Oh! Okay, something's happening. I can see, uh, I can see the header loading. That's progress. That's, um— [exhale] okay, we're getting somewhere. [deadpan] Aaaaand it's frozen again. Cool. This is, uh, this is exactly how I wanted to spend my lunch break. Just staring at a, um, at a half-loaded website like it's gonna magically— [resigned] You know what? I'll just— I'll just wait. What else am I gonna do, right? [tsk] Maybe I should get better internet.
1328  [muttering] Okay, so I need to, um, I need to tape this box up, but where's the— where's the end of this tape? There's gotta be an end somewhere, right? Like, it doesn't just, um, it doesn't just go on forever. [slightly annoyed] I mean, I literally just used this yesterday and I— I thought I left a little tab or whatever, but now it's just, uh, it's just this smooth cylinder of, of tape. [tsk] Which is, um, which is great for my fingernails. [focused] Okay, let me just— if I run my finger around the edge here, maybe I can, uh— [hmm] nope. Nothing. Wait, wait, maybe if I use my nail and just, like, scrape along the— ow, okay, that's not— that's not gonna work. [brightening] Oh! What if I, um, what if I use the scissors? Just drag the point along until it catches on something? That's gotta— that's gotta work, right? [relieved] There we go! Got it. [exhale] Finally. I swear they make this stuff impossible to, uh, to find on purpose. Like some kind of, um, some kind of tape conspiracy or whatever. [laugh]
1329  [muttering] Okay, so I need, um, I need milk and bread and— oh, and those, uh, those crackers. So that's like three things. Do I need a cart for three things? That seems, um, that seems like overkill. [uncertain] But I mean, milk is heavy, right? And I always— I always end up getting more stuff than I, uh, than I planned. Like, I'll see something and be like "oh yeah, I need that too" and then I'm, um, I'm juggling everything. [slightly frustrated] Ugh, but the carts are all the way over there and I'm already— I'm already here by the baskets. And it's not like I'm doing a big shop, it's just a quick, um, a quick in-and-out thing. [second-guessing] Although... [sigh] although last time I did this, I ended up with like six things and my arms were all— they were all cramped up by the time I got to checkout. That sucked. [resigned] You know what? Fine. Cart. I'll get the stupid cart. Better safe than, um, than sorry, right? Even if I look ridiculous pushing this giant thing around for three items. [exhale] Whatever.
1330  [muttering] Oh, come on. Come on. Of course it's— of course it's raining now. I mean, I checked the weather this morning, I literally, um, I literally looked at my phone and it said like, uh, like thirty percent chance or whatever. [slightly exasperated] Thirty percent! That's— that's basically nothing, right? That's like, oh, maybe a light drizzle, maybe some, um, some clouds. Not this— [sigh] not this actual rain that's, uh, that's definitely gonna soak through my jacket. [thinking out loud] Okay, so, um, where did I— did I bring it? My umbrella? I feel like I grabbed it from the, uh, from the stand by the door, but then I— wait, no. No no no, I remember now. I put it back because it looked, um, it looked fine outside. [resigned, with a slight laugh] Right. Okay. So my options are, uh, let's see... I can just— I can just run for it, or I can, um, I can stand under this awning like some kind of, uh, some kind of sad, umbrella-less person until it— until it stops. [deadpan] Which, knowing my luck, will be, um, will be never. [exhale] Great. This is, uh, this is just perfect.
1331  [muttering] Okay, so I was just, um— I was making all these really good points about the quarterly reports and, uh, and everyone's just sitting there staring at me like— like I'm crazy or something. Which is, um, which is weird because I thought I was being pretty, you know, pretty articulate for once. [realization dawning] Wait. Wait wait wait. [exhale] Oh no. The little, uh, the little microphone icon— is that— that's got a line through it, doesn't it. [groan] That's the mute thing. That means I'm— oh god, I'm muted, aren't I. [slightly panicked] How long have I been— I mean, I was talking for like, what, three minutes? Four minutes? About the budget allocation and the, um, the staffing issues, and they're all just— they probably think I'm just moving my mouth like some kind of, uh, like some kind of broken puppet or something. [embarrassed but trying to laugh it off] Okay, so now I have to, um, I have to unmute and just pretend like— like that didn't happen. Or do I acknowledge it? Do people acknowledge the mute thing? [sigh] This is why I hate technology. [resigned] Right. Okay. Just gonna, um, just gonna click this little button here and— and maybe make a little joke about it. Everyone does this, right? This is, uh, this is totally normal. [nervous laugh] Totally fine.
1332  [muttering] Okay, so, um, three fifty. Three fifty degrees. [sigh] How long does this thing even— I mean, it says it's preheating, but like, what does that actually mean? Five minutes? Ten minutes? I should, uh, I should probably know this by now. [slightly impatient] I just— I just want to make some, um, some frozen pizza, you know? It's not— it's not rocket science. But here I am, just, uh, just standing here like an idiot waiting for this little light to— to do whatever it's supposed to do. [thoughtful] Maybe I should, um, maybe I should use this time productively? Like, I could— I could prep the, uh, the toppings or something. But it's frozen pizza, so there's not really— there's not really much to prep, is there? [drawn out] God, I can hear it like, clicking and whooshing in there. Is that normal? I think that's normal. My old oven didn't— or wait, did it? I don't— [hmm] I don't really remember paying attention. [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna, um, I'm just gonna trust the process here. It'll beep when it's ready. Probably. Right? [laugh] Famous last words.
1333  [muttering] Oh, come on. Come on, really? The, uh— the little light's on. Of course it is. Of course the gas light decides to, um, to come on right now when I'm already running late and— [slightly exasperated] Okay, so, um, how far can I actually go on empty? Like, I feel like I've heard different things about this. Some people say you can go, like, fifty miles? But that seems— that seems optimistic. Maybe that's just, uh, just wishful thinking. [calculating] Let me think, um, when did I last get gas? Was it Tuesday? Wednesday? [tsk] I should really pay more attention to this stuff. I mean, it's not like the gas tank is, uh, is a mystery. It's right there on the dashboard. [resigned but practical] Okay, so there's that Shell station on Fifth Street, and then there's the, um, the cheaper place by the grocery store, but that's kind of out of the way and if I'm really running on fumes here— [decisive] Right. Shell it is. I'll just, uh, I'll just deal with paying an extra ten cents per gallon. That's— that's the price of poor planning, I guess.
1334  [muttering] Okay, so, um, what was it? It's gotta be— it's gotta be something simple, right? Like, I use this thing every day, I should— I should know this. [sigh] Come on, brain. [slightly more focused] Alright, let me just— let me think about this logically. It's probably, um, it's probably the usual one with the, uh, the capital letter and the numbers at the end? Or wait, no, didn't I change it last month when they made us— when they made us update everything? [frustrated] Ugh, okay, so maybe it's the, um, the dog's name thing? With the— with the birthday year? But which birthday, mine or— or the dog's? [laugh] That sounds insane. Who uses their dog's birthday for a password? [tentative] Wait wait wait, what about— what about that thing where I used, um, where I used Mom's maiden name but spelled it wrong on purpose? Like, deliberately wrong so it's more— more secure or whatever? [deflated] Or I could just, uh, I could just click "forgot password" like a normal person instead of, um, instead of sitting here talking to myself about my dog's birthday. [sigh] Yeah. Let's— let's do that.
1335  [muttering] Okay, so, um, what day is it today? I feel like I should know this. I should— I should definitely know what day of the week it is, right? [sigh] This is, uh, this is kind of embarrassing. [slightly confused] Let me think. Yesterday was, um— yesterday was... [hmm] okay, I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I always go on, like, Sundays usually. So if yesterday was Sunday, then today would be— wait, no, that's not— that's not right. [faster, working it out] Actually, hold on. The grocery store was super crowded, which means it was probably a weekend day, but I also had to, um, I had to do laundry, and I never do laundry on Sundays because that's when everyone else— [tsk] ugh, this is not helping. [more focused] Okay okay okay, let me just— what did I do this morning? I had my usual coffee, nothing special planned, no alarms went off screaming at me, so it's probably not a Monday. That's something, right? [slightly defeated] You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm just gonna check my phone like a normal person. [laugh] Why am I making this so complicated? It's probably, like, Wednesday or something perfectly normal.
1336  [muttering] Okay, so, um, restart and— and now we wait. How long does this usually take? Like, it feels like it used to be faster, but maybe that's just, uh, maybe that's just me being impatient. [slightly annoyed] I mean, I literally just wanted to, um, to open one document and now I have to sit here and— [sigh] and watch this little spinning thing. Which is, uh, which is not even spinning anymore, it's just— it's just stuck there. [uncertain] Should it be taking this long? I feel like something's wrong, but also, like, computers are weird, right? Sometimes they just, um, they just take their sweet time for no— no apparent reason. [fidgety] Okay, maybe I should've, uh, maybe I should've saved that thing I was working on first. Did I save it? I think I saved it. [worried] No wait, did I— did I actually hit save or did I just think about hitting save? [resigned] Whatever. It's— it's probably fine. It's 2024, things auto-save now, right? [exhale] Right. Just gonna, um, just gonna sit here and trust the process.
1337  [muttering under breath] Oh no, oh no, okay, um— who is that? I know them, I definitely, uh, I definitely know them. They're walking over here and I— [sigh] I cannot remember their name for the life of me. [slightly panicked] Okay, think, think. Where do I know them from? Work? No, that's not— wait, maybe work? They look familiar but not, um, not work familiar. More like, uh, like neighbor familiar? Or maybe the gym? [faster, more frantic] Sarah? No, that's not right. Sandra? Stephanie? Wait wait wait, does it start with an S? I feel like it starts with an S but that might just be, um, that might just be because I said Sarah first and now I'm, uh, I'm stuck on S names. [desperately hopeful] Maybe they'll say my name first and then I can just be like "hey you!" in that, um, in that casual way where you don't actually have to say their name back. That works, right? That's, uh, that's totally normal. [resigned] Or I could just, you know, be honest and— nope, too late, they're here. [nervous laugh] Here we go.
1338  [muttering] Okay, so I need the, um— where did they put the cereal? I swear it used to be, like, right here on the— on the middle shelf, but now it's just... [sigh] of course. Of course it's not there. [slightly annoyed] Let me just— let me look around here. Maybe they moved it to, um, to a different... [tsk] nope. Not there either. This is, uh, this is why I hate when they reorganize the whole— the whole grocery store layout. [resigned] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [drawn out] Up there. It's up there, isn't it? On the very top shelf. Because why would it be, um, why would it be anywhere a normal person could reach it? [determined but wary] Okay, so I just need to— I mean, how hard can it be? I'll just, uh, I'll stretch up and... [grunt] nope. Nope, that's not— that's not happening. My arms are apparently too short for, um, for modern grocery shopping. [contemplative] Do I ask someone? I could ask that guy over there, but he looks busy and I don't want to— [hmm] or maybe there's like a step stool or something? Do stores have those? [accepting] You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm gonna grab a different cereal. The universe is clearly telling me to try something new today. [laugh] Or maybe it's telling me to grow taller, but that ship has, uh, that ship has sailed.
1339  [muttering] Okay, so I came in here for— for something. What was I, um, what was I gonna do? I definitely had a reason, like, a specific reason for coming in here. [slightly puzzled] Was it, uh— was it something to do with the, um, the laundry? No, that's not— that doesn't feel right. I mean, I was just in the kitchen, so maybe it was, like, maybe I needed something from in here for cooking? But what would I— [drawn out, thinking] Hmm. Let me just, um, let me just retrace my steps here. I was making lunch, and then I thought, oh, I should go get— [pause] get what? What did I need to get? [slightly frustrated] This is so— this is so annoying. It was literally, like, thirty seconds ago. How do you just forget in thirty seconds? My brain is just, uh, it's just completely— [brighter, remembering] Oh! [laugh] The napkins. I came to get napkins from the, um, from the drawer. Right, okay, that makes sense. See? I'm not losing it, I just, uh— I just needed a minute.
1340  [muttering] Oh. Oh no. Um, okay, so— so that's, uh, that's not right. One black sock, one... navy? Is that navy? I mean, they're both dark, but they're— they're definitely not the same. [slightly exasperated] How did I— how did I not notice this when I was, um, when I was getting dressed? I literally put them on, like, one at a time, and I just— [sigh] I just didn't look, I guess. [considering] Okay, but like, realistically, who's gonna notice? I mean, my shoes cover most of— most of them anyway, and it's not like I'm, uh, I'm giving a presentation or anything. Right? [uncertain] But what if— what if I have to take my shoes off? Like at, um, at Sarah's place, she always makes people— oh god, what if there's yoga? There's not gonna be yoga, is there? [resigned, slightly amused] You know what, I'm just— I'm just gonna own it. Mismatched socks. That's, uh, that's my whole vibe now, I guess. Very... artsy. Very intentional. [snort] Sure.
1341  [uncertain] Oh. Oh wait, is that— are they waving at me? I think— I think they're waving. But, um, but they could be waving at, like, literally anyone behind me, right? [nervous laugh] There's probably, uh, there's probably someone right behind me. [muttering quickly] Okay, so do I wave back? Because if I wave and they're not— if they're not actually waving at me, then I'm just, um, I'm just some weirdo waving at nothing. Which is— which is not great. [slightly panicked] But if they ARE waving at me and I don't wave back, then I'm, uh, I'm rude. I'm the rude person who ignores people. [exhale] God, why is this— why is this so complicated? [thinking out loud] I mean, I could do like a half-wave? Like a, um, like a little tentative wave that could maybe pass as just, uh, just adjusting my hair or something if it goes wrong? [resigned] Okay, okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna do it. Quick little wave. [pause] There. Done. And they're... yeah, they're waving back. So we're good. We're, um, we're all good here.
1342  [casual] So I was, um, I was at the climbing gym today, and this new guy shows up, right? And he's like, uh, he's asking about bouldering, and I'm like, "Oh yeah, it's super easy, you just— you just start with the, um, the green routes, they're like beginner level." You know? I mean, I've been doing this for, uh, for like six months now, so— [matter-of-fact] And I'm like, "Yeah, just, um, just grab the holds and pull yourself up, it's— it's not rocket science." [light laugh] So he goes over to try one, and I'm, uh, I'm watching him, and he's just— he's really struggling, you know? Like, uh, like really struggling with this, um, this basic green route. [a bit uncomfortable] And I'm standing there like, "Oh, uh, maybe try— try using your legs more?" But he's getting frustrated, and I can see him, like, uh, looking around to see if people are watching him fail, and— and I realize I'm just— [uncomfortable laugh] I'm just making it worse. [growing concern] Because I kept saying "easy" and "basic" and, um, and "just do this" and— oh god, I made him feel like an idiot, didn't I? Like, uh, like I was talking to him like he was— [groan] like he was five years old or something. [spiraling with guilt] And now I'm thinking about every single thing I said, and it's all— it's all so condescending! "It's not rocket science"? Who says that? I sound like, um, like such a— [frustrated sigh] like such a pretentious asshole! He probably thinks I'm this, uh, this know-it-all jerk who was just— just showing off! [mortified] Oh my god, I think I saw him leave early because of me! I was trying to be helpful, but I just— I just made this poor guy feel stupid for, um, for being new at something! [groan] I'm never— I'm never giving unsolicited advice again, I'm— ugh, I'm the worst!
1343  [casual] [light] Oh my god, so you know how I've been putting off calling the dentist? [chuckle] It's been like— what, six months now? Maybe eight? But like, my teeth feel fine, you know? I'm not in pain or anything, so I keep thinking I'll just call tomorrow, and then tomorrow becomes next week... [conversational] I mean, I brush, I floss most of the time, I'm not a complete disaster. And honestly? Those cleanings are so awkward with all the— the scraping and the "when was your last cleaning" judgment. [dry laugh] Plus they always find something wrong just to justify the visit, right? [trailing off] [a bit concerned] But actually, speaking of teeth, I've been getting this weird... [pause] I don't know, like a sharp feeling when I drink cold stuff? Just on one side. It's probably nothing though, just sensitive teeth or— [stopping] [realization dawning] Wait. [tongue clicking] There's like... oh. Oh no. I can feel something with my tongue right now. Like a rough spot on my molar? How did I not notice this before? [growing anxiety] Oh god, what if it's a cavity? What if it's been getting worse this whole time while I've been putting off the appointment? [nervous laugh] What if I need a root canal? [spiraling] [panicked] Eight months! I haven't been to the dentist in eight months and there's definitely something wrong and now it's probably— [whimper] oh my god, what if my tooth falls out? What if I need surgery? I'm the worst patient ever, they're going to lecture me and—
1344  [frustrated] Dude, I am so— I'm so pissed right now. I lost my wallet somewhere and I've been like, tearing my apartment apart for the past hour looking for this thing. [angry] I had it this morning, I know I had it because I bought coffee on my way to work, and then I get home and it's just— [groan] it's gone. Vanished. Like where does a wallet even go? It's not like it can walk away. [increasingly agitated] I already called the coffee place, I called my work, I retraced my steps like three times. Nothing. And now I have to cancel all my cards and get a new license and it's just— ugh, it's gonna be such a pain in the ass. [still frustrated] I'm gonna have to call the bank tomorrow and sit on hold for like an hour, and then wait two weeks for new cards, and I have that dinner thing on Friday that I'll have to— [surprised] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. I'm— hold on, let me just... [sheepish] [relieved] Oh my God. [nervous laugh] It's in my other jacket. The one I wore yesterday. I just— I felt something in the pocket and... yep. There it is. [embarrassed] [laughing] I'm an idiot. I literally spent an hour having a complete meltdown over nothing. [chuckle] Don't ever let me live this down, okay?
1345  [frustrated] Oh my god, so I wake up this morning, right? And I go to make coffee and the stupid machine just— it won't even turn on. Like nothing. Not even a little light or anything. [annoyed] And of course this happens on a Monday when I have that early meeting, so I'm just standing there like an idiot pressing buttons, and I'm like, I don't have time for this. I don't have time to deal with broken appliances right now. [exasperated] So I'm gonna have to go to work with no caffeine, which you know how I get, and I'm already calculating like okay, how much is this gonna cost me to replace, when am I gonna have time to go shopping for a new one... [sigh] [irritated] And I'm walking to the bus stop all grumpy and whatever, and I'm like, this day is just— this day is already ruined before it even— [surprised] [brightening] Wait, oh my god. There's this little place right here I've never noticed before. Like literally two blocks from my apartment. "Rosewood Coffee" or something cute like that. [delighted] Dude, this place is amazing. The coffee is incredible, way better than my stupid machine makes anyway, and the guy behind the counter was so nice, and it's like— it's cheaper than Starbucks! [warm] [realizing] I think... I think my coffee maker breaking was actually like the best thing that could've happened. I have a new spot now!
1346  [casual] Oh, you know what happened earlier? This tourist stopped me on Fifth Street asking for directions to the art museum. Nice older couple, seemed really excited about it. [light laugh] I was like, oh yeah, super easy, just go straight down to Main, take a left, and you can't miss it. [conversational] They were so grateful too, you know? Like, "Oh thank you so much, you're so kind!" Made me feel all helpful and local. [chuckle] I was practically strutting after that, like look at me being a good citizen and everything. [slight pause] [a bit uncertain] But wait, actually... [trailing off] Main Street, left... that would take them to... [pause] Hold on, where does that actually go? [growing concern] Oh no. Oh no no no. [nervous laugh] That's— that's not the art museum. That's the industrial district. There's literally nothing down there except, like, warehouses and that weird fish processing plant. [increasingly distressed] They're probably still walking around right now! This sweet elderly couple wandering through loading docks because I— [groan] because I mixed up my lefts and rights like some kind of— [frustrated exhale] [spiraling] [guilty] Oh my god, they trusted me! They probably think I did it on purpose! [whimper] They're lost and it's all my fault and I'll never see them again to apologize and— [defeated] Great. Just great.
1347  [matter-of-fact] So I returned that bluetooth speaker yesterday, you know, the one I got last week? It just— the sound quality was terrible, like really tinny, and for eighty bucks I expected better. Pretty straightforward return, got my receipt, they said seven to ten business days. [casual] Actually, let me just check if it went through yet. [pause] I mean, it's only been a day but sometimes these things are faster than they say, right? [slightly confused] Hm, that's weird. It says here the return was... denied? [scoff] That doesn't make sense, I literally just dropped it off yesterday with all the original packaging. [more concerned] Wait, denied for what reason? "Item shows signs of damage not consistent with normal use." What? [frustrated laugh] What damage? I used it for like three days! [building frustration] Oh, oh this is rich. So now I don't have the speaker AND I don't have my money? They're just keeping both? [sharp exhale] How is that legal? [spiraling] Eighty dollars! Just— gone! For a product I don't even have anymore that they're claiming I somehow destroyed! [huff] What am I supposed to do, drive back there and argue with some teenager about "damage" that doesn't exist? [exasperated] [bitter laugh] This is insane. This is actual theft. They have my money and my product and I have nothing but a stupid email telling me I'm a liar!
1348  [excited] [breathless] Oh my God, okay, so you know how Sarah's birthday is on Saturday? I've been planning this whole surprise party for like three weeks now and it's— it's going to be perfect. I got everyone to agree to come, even her sister who lives like two hours away. [giddy] And I found this little bakery that makes those lemon cupcakes she's obsessed with, you know the ones from that place that closed down? They do the exact same recipe and I ordered like four dozen because you know how she gets about sharing dessert. [laugh] [animated] I've been so good about keeping it secret too, like when she was like "oh I don't know what I'm doing for my birthday, probably just staying in" I was like "yeah totally, low-key sounds nice" when inside I'm just— I'm dying to tell her about all the decorations I bought. [suddenly worried] Wait, hold on, she's texting me right now... um... [voice cracking] [emotional] Oh. Oh my God. She says "thank you for planning something so special for me, I can't wait to be surprised on Saturday." [crying happy tears] [overwhelmed] She— she knows and she's just... she's letting me surprise her anyway? That's so— [sniff] God, that's so Sarah. She probably figured it out days ago and just wanted me to have my moment.
1349  [frustrated] Oh my god, so I'm on the plane today, right? And there's this baby— like literally right behind me— just screaming. Like, full-on wailing for like twenty minutes straight. [annoyed] And I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to be understanding because babies cry, whatever, but I had such a long day and I just wanted to close my eyes for like five minutes. But no, this kid is just— [groan] it was so loud. [irritated] The mom looked exhausted too, but like, I don't know, maybe walk around with it? Do something? I kept turning around and giving these looks, which I know is terrible but I was just so— [quieter] Oh wait. Actually, hold on. [softer] [realizing] The baby just... it just went completely quiet. Like, dead silent. And I can see the mom over the seat, she's just holding this tiny little thing and it's totally passed out on her shoulder. [guilty] [warm] God, she looks so relieved. Like, actually about to cry herself. [small laugh] I feel like such an asshole now for being annoyed. She was probably more stressed than anyone, trying to calm down her kid while people like me are glaring at her. [sheepish] Yeah, I'm... I'm definitely the villain in this story.
1350  [annoyed] Oh my god, so I'm walking to work this morning, right? And I've got this podcast queued up that I've been like obsessed with lately— it's about that whole crypto scandal thing? Anyway, I'm like twenty minutes into this episode and suddenly my app just like [scoff] completely crashes. [frustrated] Just gone. Black screen, won't restart, the whole thing. And I'm standing there on the corner like jabbing at my phone like an idiot because I was right in the middle of this crazy part where they're about to reveal who was behind the whole scheme, you know? [irritated] So I'm like great, just great. Now I have to remember where I was, probably gonna have to scrub through the whole episode again to find my spot. You know how impossible that is with these true crime things? Like every part sounds the same when you're trying to— [surprised] Wait, hold on. Let me just... I'm opening it now to show you how annoying this is gonna be. [amazed] [pleased] Oh. Oh wow, it— it actually saved my place perfectly. Like exactly where it cut out. That little timeline thing is sitting right at 23 minutes and 40 seconds. [warm] [slightly embarrassed] Okay, that's... that's actually kind of impressive. [small laugh] I was so ready to write a angry review and everything.
1351  [casual] Oh, so, um, I had this weird thing today. There was this, uh, this charge on my credit card for like forty-three dollars from some, um, some company I'd never heard of? So I was like, you know, whatever, I'll just, uh, I'll just dispute it real quick. [matter-of-fact] It was called like, um, "Premium Services Solutions" or something equally, uh, equally sketchy sounding, you know? I mean, I definitely didn't— I didn't sign up for any premium, um, any premium anything recently, so, uh, yeah, seemed pretty obvious. [conversational] So I'm, um, I'm telling you this because I just got the, uh, the email back from my bank and— oh wait, hang on. [exhales] Let me just, um, let me check what they said about— [confused] Oh. Oh wait. Okay so, um, so they're saying it was— it was legitimate? And they're like, uh, listing all this evidence and— wait, what is— what is this? [growing concern] It says here that it was for, um, for my software subscription that I, uh— [sharp exhale] Oh no. Oh no no no. That's— that's my, um, my design software that I use for work. The one that, uh, that auto-renews every month. [panicking] [groaning] Oh my god, I just— I just disputed my own, um, my own legitimate charge! They probably think I'm some kind of, uh, some kind of scammer now! I'm probably flagged in their system as like, uh, as someone who tries to— [frustrated laugh] who tries to steal forty-three dollars! [spiraling] [mortified] Great! Just— just great! Now I have to, um, I have to call them back and be like "Hey, sorry, I'm just, uh, I'm just an idiot who can't remember what I, um, what I pay for!" [defeated groan] This is— this is so embarrassing!
1352  [casual] Oh, so you know how Jake was asking about getting to the new coffee place on Fifth? I told him about that little shortcut through the alley behind the old warehouse district. Saves like ten minutes, totally worth it. [conversational] He seemed pretty grateful, you know? Said he was gonna check it out this afternoon since he had that interview nearby. I was like, yeah, perfect timing, you'll beat all the traffic on Main Street. [slight pause] [thoughtful] Actually, now that I think about it... when was the last time I even went through there? It's been a while, hasn't it? Maybe like... [trailing off] maybe a few months? [a bit uncertain] Wait, didn't they... didn't they tear down some of those buildings recently? For the construction project? [nervous laugh] I mean, it's probably fine, right? It's not like they'd block off a whole— [realization dawning] Oh. Oh no. [sharp intake] The news story. About the break-ins in that area. That was— that was last week, wasn't it? [growing panic] Oh my god, I sent him through there alone! With his laptop bag! For an interview! [voice rising] What if something happens to him? What if he gets mugged or— [frantic] I have to call him. I have to call him right now. This is all my fault!
1353  [furious] Oh my God, I am so— I am SO mad right now. Some absolute moron scratched my car in the parking lot at work today. Like a big, long scratch right down the side of my door. [heated] And of course they didn't leave a note or anything, because why would they? Why would anyone take responsibility for their actions? [scoff] I literally just got that car detailed like two weeks ago, it was perfect. [frustrated] I'm gonna have to take it to a body shop, get an estimate, deal with insurance— this is gonna cost me like hundreds of dollars probably. And for what? Because some idiot can't park properly or open their door like a normal human being? [ranting] I was walking around the whole parking lot trying to figure out who did it, like looking at other cars for paint marks or whatever, but— God, people are just so inconsiderate, I swear. [quieter] [confused] Wait, hold on. Let me just— I'm looking at it again right now and... huh. Actually, um... [embarrassed] [half laugh] Oh. Oh wow, okay. It's— it's coming off. Like I'm just rubbing it with my finger and it's... that's just dirt or something. It's not actually scratched. [sheepish] [small laugh] I feel like such an idiot. I was ready to file a police report over some mud.
1354  [casual] Oh, I keep meaning to send this email to my boss about the quarterly report. I've had it sitting in my drafts forever. [light laugh] You know how it is, you write something and then you're like, "I'll just review it one more time" and then it just... sits there. [conversational] It's about those budget projections she asked for. Nothing major, just some numbers she needed for the board meeting. I remember being pretty thorough with it actually, did all the charts and everything. [slightly concerned] Wait, let me just check when I actually wrote this thing. [pause] Okay, pulling up my drafts now... where is it... there it is. Um. [nervous laugh] This says... March fifteenth? [growing worried] March fifteenth. That's— that's like three weeks ago. The board meeting was... [trailing off] oh no. Oh no no no. [panic building] The board meeting was March twentieth! She needed this for the board meeting and I— [sharp exhale] I just let it sit in my drafts like some kind of— ugh! [spiraling] She probably thinks I completely ignored her request! Or that I'm totally incompetent! She's probably been covering for me this whole time, making excuses about why the numbers weren't ready, and I've just been walking around like everything's fine! [frantic] [horrified] Oh my god, what if this affects the whole quarterly review? What if they made decisions without the data? [groan] I'm so fired. I'm so, so fired.
1355  [frustrated] So you know how my sister's birthday was like two weeks ago? And I'm sitting there waiting for her card to show up, and waiting, and I'm like— where is it? Like I sent hers on time, obviously. [annoyed] It finally comes today and I'm just, ugh, I'm so irritated about it, you know? Like it's got this little note about how sorry she is it's late, blah blah, and I'm like— just send it on time? It's not that hard to put something in the mail. [still annoyed] I almost didn't even want to open it because I was so— I was just being petty about the whole thing. Like why does she always do this? Birthdays, Christmas, everything's always late with her. [surprised] But then I— oh wait, there's like— [rustling sound] there's cash in here. Like actual cash, not just a check. [softer] [slightly guilty] Oh. There's... there's like a hundred bucks in here. And this note about how she wanted to get me something special but didn't know what, so she thought I could pick something out myself. [warm] [embarrassed] God, I feel like such a— [half laugh] here I am being all mad about it being late and she put like actual thought into this. Way more than I put into hers, honestly.
1356  [frustrated] Ugh, okay so you know how I've been planning Jake's surprise party for like three weeks? Well apparently his sister totally ruined it today. She just— she just blurted it out when they were having lunch, like "oh I can't wait for your party tonight!" [annoyed] I'm so mad, like I specifically told everyone to keep it quiet, and she just— [sigh] I don't know why I even bothered. I spent so much time coordinating with everyone, getting the cake, decorating... [defeated] So now he knows, and I'm just sitting here feeling like an idiot because the whole surprise is blown and I don't even know if I should still— if we should still do it or just cancel the whole thing. [confused] Wait, he's— he's calling me right now. Hold on, let me just— Hello? Oh hey Jake, I'm so sorry about— what? What do you mean what party? [realization dawning] Wait, you— you don't know about tonight? But Sarah said she told you about— Oh my god. [half laugh] Oh my GOD. She was talking about Mom's birthday party next weekend! [excited] [relieved] He has no idea! The surprise is still— it's still a surprise! [laugh] I almost had a heart attack for nothing. Sarah was talking about a completely different party this whole time!
1357  [frustrated] Oh my God, I'm so pissed right now. You know that internship at the design firm I've been wanting forever? The one I told you about like a million times? Well they— they filled it. Just like that. [bitter] I was supposed to hear back today and instead I get this like super generic email being like "thank you for your interest, we've decided to go with another candidate." Like, thanks for nothing. I was so ready to quit my stupid retail job and actually do something, you know, meaningful with my summer. [defeated] And the worst part is I turned down that thing at my mom's friend's office because I was so sure I was gonna get this one. So now I'm just— I'm stuck folding sweaters for another three months while everyone else gets these amazing opportunities and— [surprised] Wait, hold on. My phone's buzzing and it's... oh. Oh wow, it's Professor Chen from my portfolio class. [excited] [disbelieving] She— okay she says the creative director at her old agency just called her looking for an intern and she immediately thought of me? And it's paid. Like, actually paid. Way more than that other place was offering. [laughing] [amazed] I literally cannot believe this. This is so much better than— God, maybe getting rejected was actually the best thing that could've happened.
