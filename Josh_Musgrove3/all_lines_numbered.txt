1  We need to talk.
2  You were on your phone the entire time yesterday.
3  My dad's in the hospital.
4  I did tell you. Three times.
5  "My dad had a heart attack." Pretty clear.
6  That's my job now?
7  Right. Your deadlines.
8  Every time? This is my dad.
9  Good to know where I rank.
10  You haven't asked how he is.
11  We need to talk about the comments.
12  Supportive.
13  It's not just the jeans thing.
14  And the "are you sure you want dessert" thing. And asking if I've been stress eating.
15  Yeah. You are.
16  I don't want to hear about your sister's fitness journey either.
17  Do you think I don't own a mirror?
18  It really hurts. Every single time.
19  I've been dreading hanging out with you.
20  I need you to actually mean that. Not just say it.
21  So. Hit 100k yesterday.
22  Yeah. Woke up to all these notifications. My phone crashed twice.
23  Two and a half. Feels weird.
24  That's the thing. It's just a number on a screen. Nothing's different.
25  Some. Mostly garbage. One wanted me to promote their "revolutionary" toe spacers.
26  Tech reviews. So... not toe people.
27  Maybe. I don't know. Might just keep doing what I'm doing.
28  Bought myself a coffee this morning. The large one.
29  I like pizza.
30  Fine. But you're not making a scene when we get there.
31  Three weeks. I was there for three weeks.
32  Right.
33  Everyone else managed to show up.
34  It's not the same.
35  Weren't you?
36  I needed you there.
37  You could've tried.
38  It doesn't.
39  You're my best friend. Were.
40  I was actually drowning. Alone.
41  We need to talk about this hot and cold thing you do.
42  Yeah. You do.
43  Sure sounds like it.
44  Do you know how exhausting it is? Never knowing which version of you I'm getting?
45  You are.
46  It's not stupid. It's hurtful.
47  I can't keep doing this dance with you.
48  How? You've said this before.
49  You're seeing someone?
50  That's... actually a real step. I didn't know it was that serious for you.
51  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I've got like— I've got all these chargers here and I have no idea which one goes to, uh, to what. This is— this is ridiculous. How do I have so many random chargers?
52  [competitive tone] Oh, you're going down tonight, Sarah. [faster] We've been practicing Settlers of Catan for weeks. [Sharp laugh] Tom even built a spreadsheet to track optimal resource combinations—tell them about your probability charts, honey.
53  [defensive] Those were probably casual players. [muttering] We're talking about real strategy here, not luck. [louder, pointed] Besides, didn't you lose to the Johnsons last week? I heard through the grapevine you rage-quit during Monopoly.
54  [Gasp] [indignant] That was completely different! The table was wobbly! [quieter, threatening] You know what, let's just start playing and see who's crying into their wine glass by nine o'clock tonight, shall we?
55  [sarcastically] Lucky dice? [Bitter laugh] How scientific of you. [mumbling quickly] Tom's algorithm predicted a seventy-three percent win rate for us tonight based on past performance metrics and your tendency to make emotional trades.
56  [through gritted teeth] There is no halftime in Catan! [Exhale] See, this is exactly why we're going to destroy you. [whispered intensely] You don't even know basic board game etiquette, yet you call yourselves competitors.
57  [nervously] We'll see who's laughing when we control all the wheat. [more confidently] Your weakness has always been resource management, Sarah. [Snicker] Remember Thanksgiving? You traded away three ore for one sheep—one sheep!
58  [mock surprise] Oh, we're bringing up New Year's now? [gleefully] Fantastic! Should we discuss how Mark threw the robber at me? [louder] Or how you "accidentally" miscounted your victory points three times?
59  [skeptically] Seventeen? [Loud laugh] Playing against your parents doesn't count! [smugly] Real competitors play in sanctioned tournaments, which we've actually won, unlike certain people who only play in their living room.
60  [wounded] Those kids were prodigies! [defensively faster] They'd been featured in Board Game Weekly! [Sigh] Whatever, just roll for first placement already. Tom's Excel macro says whoever goes first has the advantage tonight.
61  [proudly] It's called preparation! [quieter, intense] Something you'd understand if you took this seriously. [building excitement] When we win tonight, we're posting it everywhere—Facebook, Instagram, your mom's book club group chat, everywhere!
62  [calmly] I understand this is an emergency, sir. [reassuring] Let me pull up the next available slot. [professionally] Can you give me your address and account number, if you have it?
63  [apologetically] I'm checking our system now, Mr... [pause] Johnson, is it? [more firmly] Our earliest emergency slot is at 2:30 PM, but there's a, um, hundred-fifty dollar emergency surcharge.
64  [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration. [hopeful] Let me check if tech number 47 can reroute—he's finishing at 1245 Oak Street. [cautiously] Would you be willing to pay the premium rate of $275?
65  [relieved] Perfect, I've secured Tony, badge ID T-9847. [more confidently] He'll arrive between 12:45 and 1:15 PM. [helpfully] Meanwhile, shut off your main water valve—it's usually near the water heater.
66  [empathetically] I'm truly sorry about your belongings, Mr. Johnson. [professionally] Tony will call from 555-0199 when he's ten minutes away. [reassuring tone] He's our best emergency specialist—eighteen years experience with floods.
67  [calmly] That's completely understandable, sir. [more seriously] Tony will document everything with photos for your claim. [helpful] Do you need our insurance liaison contact? It's extension 4455.
68  [confidently] Tony handles three to four floods weekly, especially in your ZIP code, 44126. [reassuring] He'll bring our heavy-duty pump, model XP-500. [warmly] You're in excellent hands, I promise.
69  [sympathetically] Older homes can be challenging, absolutely. [helpfully] Tony specializes in vintage properties actually. [more positively] He'll assess if you need our waterproofing service—warranty code WP-2024—to prevent future issues.
70  [understanding] No apology needed—this is incredibly stressful! [reassuringly] I've marked your case as priority one, reference number EM-78234. [warmly] Tony will take excellent care of you, Mr. Johnson.
71  [professionally] Perfect, all noted in the system. [kindly] Tony will text updates to your number ending in 3847. [sympathetic tone] Hang in there, Mr. Johnson—help is on the way!
72  [briskly] Good afternoon, Valley Medical Labs, this is Sarah speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today—do you have a patient ID number ready?
73  [apologetically] Let me just... pull that up for you right away. [pause] [more concerned] Oh, I see there's been a delay with your lipid panel—looks like the sample needed to be re-run.
74  [quickly] I completely understand your frustration, and you're absolutely right—someone should have contacted you. [more firmly] The system shows a notification was sent, but, um, sometimes those get caught in spam filters.
75  [reassuring] The good news is the re-test was completed yesterday morning. [speaking faster] Your results should be uploaded within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, definitely by Thursday at the latest.
76  [more confidently] I'm putting a priority flag on your file right now—actually, let me... [briskly] I'm sending a direct message to the lab supervisor to expedite this for your Friday appointment.
77  [carefully] While I can't make absolute promises, the priority flag means your results jump to the front of the queue. [more enthusiastically] In my experience, these usually process within twelve hours once flagged.
78  [warmly] Please do ask for me—I'll be here nine to five. [quickly] I'm also adding my direct extension to your file notes, it's 2-2-4.
79  [understanding] No apologies needed—waiting for health results is incredibly stressful. [more gently] We see it every day, and honestly, two weeks is unacceptable for a standard panel.
80  [reassuringly] It's actually quite rare, maybe one in two hundred samples. [speaking faster] Usually it's due to temperature issues during transport or, occasionally, insufficient sample volume—but the re-test results are completely reliable.
81  [laughing gently] I promise we're much more organized than that! [briskly] Is there anything else I can help with while I have your file open—update contact information, anything like that?
82  [Frustrated] Okay, so I definitely came in through the—no wait, that was yesterday. [Groan] This is getting ridiculous.
83  [Fast] I'm literally walking in circles here, like, I've passed that same pillar three times already! [Nervous laugh]
84  [Whisper] Maybe if I just, um, close my eyes and try to retrace my steps... [Slow] That's supposed to work, right?
85  [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, every single car in this lot is silver—that really narrows it down. [Tsk]
86  [Happy] Wait, wait, I think I see it over—oh never mind, that's not even the right model. [Disappointed]
87  [Slow] You know what, I'm gonna systematically check every single row, starting from A1. [Determined]
88  [Shout] Has anyone seen a blue Honda? [Fast] Anyone? It's kinda dented on the side?
89  [Sad] I can't believe I'm that person who—who loses their car in a parking lot. [Sigh] My kids are never gonna let me live this down.
90  [Angry] This is what happens when they don't have proper signage! [Fast] Like, would it kill them to put up some landmarks or something?
91  Was it level 2 or level 3? [Confused] Er, actually, is there even a level 3 in this place?
92  [Chuckle] I should probably stop hitting the panic button—people are starting to stare. [Embarrassed]
93  [Disappointed] Twenty minutes. [Slow] I've been wandering around for twenty whole minutes looking for my own car.
94  [Fast] Okay so basically I remember there was a truck next to me, or wait—was it a van? [Frustrated]
95  [Sarcastic] Sure, let's make all the sections the same color, that's super helpful for people like me. [Groan]
96  [Whisper] Please be in this row, please be in this row... [Hopeful] [Sigh] Nope.
97  [Happy] Oh my god, there it is! [Laugh] I literally just walked past it five seconds ago!
98  You'd think after, um, after fifteen years of driving I'd remember to—to take a photo or something, y'know? [Tsk]
99  [Angry] I swear I parked right next to the entrance! [Slow] Unless... unless I came in the other entrance?
100  [Sad] Maybe someone towed it? [Fast] No wait, that's crazy, I've only been here like an hour, right?
101  [Chuckle] I'm gonna start dropping breadcrumbs next time, honestly—this is getting embarrassing. [Sigh]
102  [frustrated] Oh my God, you're not gonna believe what they made me do today. I had to go through every single invoice from the last six months and like, categorize them by vendor. All of them. Manually.
103  So I won trivia night.
104  Yeah. O'Malley's.
105  Just me and some guy named Derek. He knew all the sports questions.
106  Geography. And 90s music.
107  You fell asleep during "OK Computer."
108  Two hundred dollars. Split it with Derek.
109  Maybe. Derek wants to.
110  He's fine. Talks a lot about baseball.
111  Good, I guess. We were "Quiz in My Pants."
112  Derek's. I wanted "The Trivial Pursuits."
113  You always have something to say about what I'm doing wrong.
114  There's honest and there's constant criticism.
115  Every. Single. Time.
116  I asked about the content. Not my speaking voice.
117  That's your definition of supportive?
118  Wow.
119  Since it became one-sided.
120  Because you ask. I don't.
121  That was my choice to make.
122  Not the bad guy. Just exhausting.
123  So I won that thing yesterday.
124  Yeah. First place.
125  It wasn't a big deal.
126  There were only twelve people.
127  My mom cried.
128  There's video. It's... not great.
129  Ballroom, actually.
130  This woman from class. Sandra. She's sixty-three.
131  She was better than me.
132  Three months. Every Tuesday.
133  I got in.
134  Yeah. That one.
135  This morning. Email.
136  I don't know. Weird.
137  They picked fifteen people. Out of three hundred.
138  Apparently.
139  What if I'm not ready?
140  I guess. It starts next month.
141  Some VP from their Seattle office. Never heard of her.
142  Maybe you're right.
143  You gave my number to Alex.
144  By giving out my personal information?
145  Yeah.
146  I had three missed calls before noon.
147  And texts. Lots of texts.
148  Don't make it worse.
149  It wasn't nothing to me.
150  Why didn't you just ask me first?
151  You thought I'd say no. So you did it anyway.
152  Just... next time? Ask me. About anything that involves me.
153  [muttering] Okay, what is— what is that word? It's, um, it's right there, I can literally feel it, like, sitting right on my— on my tongue and I just, uh, I just can't get it out. This is so, um, so annoying.
154  [shaky voice] I got the job offer yesterday. [Deep breath] It's in Seattle—the position I've dreamed about for years. [voice breaking] But I can't imagine leaving you, leaving everything we've built here together since college.
155  [through tears] They want me there by next month. [quivering] I haven't even said yes yet because every time I try, I picture your face. [Gasping breath] Remember when we promised we'd be each other's maids of honor?
156  [pleading tone] You could come with me! [desperately faster] There are tons of marketing jobs in Seattle, and we could get a place together like we always talked about. [Sniffling] Please, just think about it for a second.
157  [angry suddenly] Why does growing up have to mean growing apart? [louder] This is exactly what happened to my sister and her best friend! [Bitter sob] I swore I'd never let distance destroy us like that, ever.
158  [laughing while crying] Remember when we got matching tattoos and swore we'd live next door forever? [nostalgic tone] God, we were so naive. [Hiccupping sob] I'm going to miss our Tuesday wine nights more than anything else.
159  [relieved exhale] You really mean that? Even with the time difference and everything? [hopeful whisper] I've been so scared to tell you because I thought you'd hate me. [quickly] I've been carrying this secret for three days.
160  [sobbing harder] Stop being so supportive, you're making this worse! [laughing through tears] I had a whole speech prepared about how we'd stay close. [softer] But you already know we will, don't you? You always know everything.
161  [incredulous] Replace you? [louder and firm] You're literally tattooed on my ankle, you weirdo! [dropping to whisper] No one else would understand our synchronized period cry sessions or our elaborate revenge plots. You're stuck with me forever, distance be damned.
162  [overwhelmed] You already bought a ticket? [voice rising] Before I even accepted the job? [Soft sob] This is why I love you, you beautiful, presumptuous person. Of course you knew I'd take it before I did.
163  [whimpering] Come here, I need the biggest hug. [muffled against shoulder] We're going to make this work. [fiercely] Long distance friendship is nothing compared to what we've already survived. Seattle doesn't stand a chance against us, I promise.
164  [cheerfully] Good afternoon! Yes, this is Relaxation Plus. [sympathetic] I completely understand the ZX-9000 can be overwhelming at first. [warmly] Let me pull up your account—R45-2891, perfect—what specific features are giving you trouble?
165  [reassuring] Oh, those are actually our premium features! [enthusiastically] Shiatsu mode 3 targets your lumbar region with—let's see—approximately 14 pressure points. [more slowly] Neural wave therapy uses rhythmic pulses, kind of like... ocean waves, but for your spine.
166  [chuckles] That's actually a great description! [informatively] Atlantic mode operates at 65 RPM with deeper compression—code AT-550 in your settings. [gentler] Pacific is more subtle, about 40 RPM, perfect for when you're feeling, well, benumbed like now.
167  [laughing softly] No, no, the chair remembers for you! [excitedly] You can save your favorite combinations—pressure level, heat intensity, even the foot roller speed. [helpfully] Most customers use slot A for morning wake-up, maybe slot B for post-workout at intensity level 8.
168  [calmly] The 12.5 Hz setting is completely normal—that's our patented VibroCalm technology. [more seriously] However, teeth tingling means you might have the headrest position too high. [instructively] Try lowering it about 2 inches using lever L-4 on your right side.
169  [briskly] Good afternoon, this is Allied Loan Services, how can I— [quickly] I see you're calling about payment posting. [more warmly] Let me pull up your account right away, what's your loan number?
170  [rapidly] I see the account here, let me just— [pause] [more carefully] Yes, I show a pending payment from the 15th. [apologetically] Sometimes our system takes up to, um, fourteen business days to fully process.
171  [defensive] Sir, I understand your frustration, but the processing time is clearly stated in your loan agreement. [more quickly] Page twelve, section four-B. [softer] Would you like me to expedite this with my supervisor?
172  [hurriedly] Actually, wait, I'm seeing something here. [confused] Did you... did you send the payment to our old processing center? [more gently] We switched banks last month, sent out notices.
173  [speaking quickly] The payment will bounce back to your account within five to seven— [catching themselves] [more slowly] I mean, it's safe, don't worry. [reassuringly] We can waive the late fee once it's resolved.
174  [sympathetically] I wish I could, I really do. [more firmly] But the system won't let me override without the actual funds. [quickly] Let me create a case number for you, okay?
175  [uncomfortably] Sir, I— [pause] [more determined] You know what, hold on. [typing rapidly] I'm flagging this as urgent hardship, that should escalate it within twenty-four hours instead.
176  [earnestly] This is different, I'm putting my employee ID on it. [speaking faster] My direct extension is 4-5-5-1, ask for Marcus. [firmly] I'll personally track this tomorrow morning.
177  [confidently] It will work. [more quietly] Between you and me, I've seen this exact issue before. [quickly] The old bank still forwards payments, just slowly. Should hit by tomorrow afternoon.
178  [gently] I've noted everything in your file. [more assertively] When you call tomorrow, even if you don't reach me, any agent will see the urgent flag. [reassuringly] We'll get this sorted, I promise.
179  [Fast] Oh hey, I didn't even—I mean, I wasn't expecting to see you here, that's so random! [Nervous laugh] [Chuckle]
180  [Slow] So, um, do you come to this coffee shop often, or...? [Tsk] [Whisper] That sounded like a pickup line, didn't it?
181  [Happy] Your dog is literally the cutest thing I've ever—wait, is that weird to say? [Laugh]
182  [Sarcastic] Yeah, I totally just tripped over nothing back there on purpose. [Sigh] It's my signature move, actually.
183  [Disappointed] I was gonna ask if you wanted to—actually, never mind, you're probably busy anyway. [Fast] It's nothing important.
184  [Whisper] Did you just smell my hair? [Slow] Because I may have used, like, three different shampoos this morning.
185  [Angry] My phone's being so stupid right now—I swear I'm not ignoring your text! [Groan] Technology hates me today.
186  [Chuckle] We keep bumping into each other, it's almost like—I mean, not that I'm keeping track or anything. [Happy]
187  [Sad] Everyone says I get really awkward around people I—um, around new people, y'know? [Sigh]
188  [Shout] That's my favorite band too! [Fast] Sorry, I didn't mean to yell, I just got kinda excited there.
189  [Slow] You've got this, uh, this little eyelash on your—can I just...? [Whisper] Make a wish.
190  [Sarcastic] [Groan] Sure, let's talk about the weather again, because that's not obvious or anything.
191  [Fast] I should probably go—I mean, unless you wanna hang out more? [Disappointed] But you probably have plans already.
192  [Happy] [Laugh] You remembered that dumb story I told you last week? That's actually—wow, okay, that's really sweet.
193  [Tsk] My hands are literally shaking from all this coffee. [Fast] It's definitely the coffee, nothing else, just caffeine.
194  [Slow] So your friend mentioned you're single—I mean, she mentioned you like hiking! [Angry] [Groan] Why am I like this?
195  [Whisper] Can I tell you something weird? [Chuckle] I practiced this conversation in my car for like twenty minutes.
196  [Disappointed] Yeah, I'm totally fine being just friends. [Sigh] [Sarcastic] It's exactly what I was hoping for, honestly.
197  [Shout] [Happy] No way, you hate pineapple on pizza too? We're basically soulma—I mean, yeah, it's gross, right?
198  [Fast] Okay so I'm gonna be super casual and just—oh god, you're looking at me, quick, say something normal! [Laugh]
199  [frustrated] Ugh, so I'm looking at my history test from yesterday and I'm like— I'm so annoyed because I got this one question wrong about the Treaty of Versailles, and I know I studied that like crazy. Like I literally made flashcards for that whole unit.
200  I—okay okay, you're right about that part. I should've. But honestly? I was embarrassed and I didn't know what to say that wouldn't sound like a shitty excuse. [frustrated laugh] Guess that worked out great.
201  Oh, so now we're gonna throw the whole friendship away over this? Look look, I messed up, but you're being kinda brutal here. Like, I get you're hurt, but—
202  Yeah, and I appreciate that, I really do. But that doesn't mean I'm suddenly gonna be perfect at everything while my world's falling apart. I'm barely functioning here.
203  Don't—don't do that. Don't give me the one-word passive-aggressive thing. If you wanna be mad, be mad, but at least talk to me like I'm still your friend and not some stranger who wronged you.
204  Are you seriously—[scoff] of course I am. Jesus. One mistake and you're ready to throw everything away? That's what we're doing now?
205  Fine fine, one important thing. And I'm sorry I forgot it, alright? I am. But I'm also kinda disappointed that you can't cut me any slack when you know—you literally know—everything I'm going through right now.
206  Oh my god, wait—what? What didn't I—oh NO. No no no no. The art show. That was last night wasn't it? I'm so—I'm literally the worst person alive right now.
207  I had it in my calendar for next week, I swear I thought—that's not an excuse though, I know that's not an excuse. You reminded me like three times and I still—[groan] I genuinely wanna crawl into a hole right now.
208  You waited for—oh god. I'm so sorry. Like, I don't even know what to say except I'm sorry. This was huge for you, I know it was huge, your first gallery showing and I just—I completely failed you as a friend.
209  I've been so scattered lately with work and the move and—no, y'know what? Those aren't excuses. There's literally no excuse for missing this. I should've set like five alarms, I should've—I should've been better. [nervous laugh] I really messed up.
210  Oh that's—that makes it worse somehow. I told you I'd be there, I promised I'd be there and then I just... didn't show up. Like what kind of friend does that? I'm honestly disgusted with myself right now.
211  You saved me a—okay now I actually might cry. Listen, I know—I know saying sorry isn't enough but like, is there any way I can make this right? Can I—I dunno, take you to dinner? Buy one of your pieces? Actually wait, I wanna buy one anyway but—
212  No no, that's not—that's not what I meant. I just... I wanna show you that I care, y'know? Because I do care, so much, and I'm furious at myself for making you think I don't.
213  You did. You absolutely did and I—god, I even helped you pick which pieces to display, didn't I? [sigh] And then I couldn't even bother to show up. I honestly don't blame you if you hate me right now.
214  That's somehow worse. But I—I get it. I really do. Look, I know this is gonna sound empty but like, this will never happen again, okay? Important stuff, I'm gonna—I'm gonna put it in my phone with a million reminders. Actually no, I'll get it tattooed on my arm if I have to.
215  I will. I swear I will. And I—I really am sorry. Like from the bottom of my heart sorry. You deserved better from me, and um... yeah. I'm gonna do better. I promise.
216  Oh god—okay, I know how this looks but I didn't mean to tell him, it just... it kinda slipped out? We were talking about family stuff and I—I wasn't thinking, I'm so sorry.
217  No no no, that's—that's not what I meant. I mean, yes, technically it did but like... Marcus was talking about his own parents divorcing and I just wanted to make him feel less alone, y'know? [nervous laugh] That's not an excuse though, I know that.
218  I know. God, I know and I feel like such garbage about it. Like literally the second it came out of my mouth I wanted to take it back—I actually tried to backtrack but he'd already heard it and I just... I panicked.
219  You're right. You're completely right and I—there's literally no good reason for what I did. I broke your trust and that's... [sigh] that's not the kind of friend I wanna be. I swear I've never done anything like this before.
220  That's not—okay, I deserve that. But honestly? I've been feeling sick about this for like three days straight. I kept wanting to text you but I didn't know how to even start apologizing for something this bad.
221  I was gonna tell you! I just—I kept typing out messages and deleting them because nothing sounded right, nothing could fix it, y'know? And then Marcus said he ran into you yesterday and I figured—oh god, did he say something to you?
222  Shit. Shit shit shit. I'm so—I told him not to bring it up to you! I specifically said—actually that doesn't matter. What matters is I messed up and I hurt you and I don't... I don't know how to make this right but I want to try.
223  Please just—give me a chance? Like, I know I don't deserve it but our friendship means everything to me and I can't—[groan] I can't lose you over my stupid mouth. Tell me what to do. Anything.
224  Yeah. Yeah of course, take all the time you need. I just... can I just say one more thing? I know I talk too much—that's literally the problem here—but I need you to know that you can trust me. Or, I mean, I know you can't right now but I'm gonna earn it back. However long that takes.
225  Wait—I mean, okay. Yeah. I'll... I'll be here whenever you're ready to talk. And I really am sorry. Like, more sorry than I've ever been about anything.
226  What? No, I—wait, what did I forget? Oh my god, did we have plans today? I'm so sorry, I've been completely out of it lately and—
227  Oh no. Oh no no no. [groan] I'm—I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? I literally had it in my calendar and everything, I just—this week has been absolutely insane with work and I wasn't even looking at dates, just trying to survive, y'know?
228  Please don't—okay, I know that's not an excuse. There is no excuse. Your birthday is like, the one thing I should never forget and I just... I completely spaced it. I'm so, so sorry.
229  I know, I know I did. And that makes it even worse, doesn't it? Like last year I was traveling so at least I had a reason—not that it was a good reason—but this year I was literally here and I still managed to screw it up. [nervous laugh] I'm actually terrible.
230  Can I—would you let me make it up to you? I mean, I know I can't really make up for forgetting but maybe we could do something tonight? Or—or this weekend, whatever works for you. I wanna take you out, do the whole thing properly.
231  Yeah! Like dinner at that place you love—the one with the, um, the really good pasta? And drinks after, my treat obviously. Or we could—actually, what do you wanna do? It's your birthday, well, was your birthday, so you should pick.
232  Oof. Yeah, that's—[sigh] that's fair. That's completely fair. I really hurt you, didn't I? God, I'm sorry. I keep saying that but I genuinely mean it. You're like, one of the most important people in my life and I just... I let you down.
233  I have been, but that's not—I mean, yeah, work's been crazy but that shouldn't matter. You matter more than work stuff, you always have. I've just been really bad at, um, at showing that lately I guess. I need to—I gotta do better.
234  What? Yes! Yes, of course I do! Is that—is that what you think? That I don't wanna be friends? Because that's so far from—I'm just an idiot who can't manage their life properly. But losing you would literally destroy me. Please don't think I don't care about you.
235  Okay, that's—I get that. I really do. But can we maybe... can we talk about this over coffee or something? I wanna fix this—fix us—if you'll let me. I know I don't deserve it but I'm asking anyway because you mean everything to me and I can't—[quieter] I can't lose you over this.
236  Wait, what? You're—you're seriously mad about that? I thought this was just like, a casual thing, not some exclusive guest list situation.
237  You said "small," yeah, but I didn't think that meant—look, when you say "come by Saturday," that usually means it's chill. Like, bring whoever. That's how it's always been with us.
238  Okay okay, but how was I supposed to know that? You never said "don't bring anyone" or [scoff] "invitation only" or whatever. I'm not a mind reader.
239  That's—wow, okay. Common sense? Really? Because literally every other time we've hung out, it's been totally fine to bring people. Remember Jake's thing? Or when we went to that concert? You brought like three randoms without asking.
240  How? How is it different? Because—I mean, honestly, it feels like you're just making up rules now and getting mad at me for not [frustrated laugh] magically knowing them.
241  Oh, so it's about the money? Is that—fine, I'll Venmo you right now if that's what this is about. But I don't think it is. I think you're just pissed and looking for reasons.
242  Then explain it! Because from where I'm standing, I brought a couple friends to what I thought was a casual hangout, and now you're treating me like I—like I committed some huge betrayal or something.
243  And I'm sorry, I am, but you didn't—you gotta communicate that stuff. I can't just guess what "small" means to you. To me, small is like, under ten people, y'know? Not... two.
244  Yeah, maybe. Maybe I should've. But also maybe you should've been clearer about what you wanted. [sigh] Like, we're both kinda at fault here, but you're acting like it's all on me.
245  I didn't—that wasn't the intention at all. Look look, I get that you're upset, and I'm sorry it went down like this, but I genuinely thought I was just bringing some fun people to make it more lively. I wasn't trying to disrespect you or—or whatever you think I did.
246  [muttering] Okay, so, um, this line is definitely not— it's not moving at all. Like, at all. I've been standing here for, what, like five minutes? And we haven't— we haven't moved even one person forward. [slightly incredulous] What is even— what's even happening up there? I can't see, um, I can't see what the holdup is, but there's gotta be something. Maybe it's like a price check or, uh, or someone's trying to use expired coupons or— [sigh] I don't know. [resigned] I mean, I could switch lines, but then— but then that's always when this one starts moving again, right? That's like, um, that's like a universal law or something. The second you switch, your old line becomes the fast one. [contemplative] Although, honestly, that lady over there looks like she's— she's moving pretty good. Her line's definitely— wait, no, she just stopped too. [tsk] Never mind. [flat] Okay, so I guess we're all just, um, we're all just standing here now. Living our best grocery store life. This is fine. This is, uh, this is totally how I wanted to spend my Saturday.
247  [Roaring] We did it, brother! [breathless] The emperor's finest warriors lay beaten in the sand! [triumphant shout] Twenty years I've fought in this arena, and never have I felt victory taste this sweet upon my tongue!
248  [Deep growl] Let them remember this day. [building intensity] Two slaves who became gods in this circle of death! [Spitting] The emperor watches from his throne, and for once, his champions taste defeat's bitter dust.
249  [Low and dangerous] This changes everything, you realize? [faster] No more fighting for scraps, no more sleeping in chains. [Victory cry] Freedom tastes sweeter than wine, and we've earned it with blood and steel today!
250  [Weary but proud] My wounds sing with purpose now. [steadier] Every scar was worth this moment, every drop of blood a payment. [Thunderous] Rome will speak our names in taverns and temples for generations to come!
251  [Soft wonder] The silence before they cheered felt eternal. [building excitement] Then came the thunder of ten thousand voices screaming our worth! [Hoarse shout] We are no longer property—we are champions who conquered the unconquerable!
252  [Gravelly voice] The sand beneath our feet holds their blood now, not ours. [lighter] For once, we walk away while others are carried. [Bitter laugh] The mighty emperor must crown slaves as his new champions!
253  [Exhausted pride] My sword arm burns like fire, but my spirit soars higher. [stronger] We entered as entertainment for nobles. [Quiet intensity] We leave as the men who humbled an empire's greatest warriors before thousands.
254  [Booming declaration] Let every fighter in every ludus hear this tale! [softer] Hope lives even in chains, brother. [Building roar] We've proven that courage and skill can topple even golden-armored arrogance from its throne!
255  [Grim satisfaction] Their training, their breeding, their noble blood—all worthless. [louder] We learned to fight in desperation's shadow. [Barking laugh] That made us deadlier than any emperor's pampered warriors could ever hope to become!
256  [Slow and meaningful] This arena has seen our transformation, brother. [quickening] From nothing to everything in one glorious afternoon. [Choking up] My children will know their father stood tall when the empire tried to crush him.
257  [apologetic] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [calmly] Let me pull up your account using that order number—8847392-A, you said? [more reassuringly] We're processing recalls as quickly as possible, though I know the delays have been... challenging.
258  [concerned] Oh my goodness, was anyone hurt? [more urgently] If there's been an injury, we need to file report IR-2024-556 immediately. [sympathetic] I'm escalating this right now to priority status—your safety is absolutely our primary concern here.
259  [professionally] I see all three tickets in our system, and I sincerely apologize for the runaround. [more confidently] The parts—specifically component DW-45X—arrived at our warehouse on October 2nd, but [hesitant] distribution has been... experiencing some logistics issues unfortunately.
260  [uncomfortable] Different regions have different fulfillment centers, and—well, ZIP code 94102 has had some... [sighs heavily] Look, unofficially, our Sacramento facility had a system crash. [more quietly] Your technician slot for November 8th at 2 PM somehow got deleted.
261  [quickly] Absolutely, yes, I'm authorizing compensation code RB-7745-COMP right now for $200. [more eagerly] Plus, I'm personally scheduling you for October 28th—that's Thursday—between 10 AM and noon. [firmly] I'll email confirmation to your account ending in 3847 within five minutes, guaranteed.
262  [confidently] I'm assigning senior technician Marcus, badge MT-4493, to your case personally. [reassuring] He's never missed an appointment in eight years, and [more warmly] between you and me, he's the one who should've handled this from the start.
263  [attentively] Updating to j.davidson at techmail dot com right now, got it. [helpful] I'm also including Marcus's direct line—extension 4-8-2—in case you need to confirm morning of. [more personally] Is there anything else I can help resolve today, Mr. Davidson?
264  [empathetically] I completely understand the pressure you're under, truly I do. [determined] The confirmation's already generating—reference TK-20241021-B—and I'm CC'ing my supervisor. [more gently] We'll make this right, Mr. Davidson, you have my word on that.
265  [professionally] Exactly right—October 28th, 10 AM to noon, Marcus, badge MT-4493. [warmly] I'm also adding priority flag PF-888 to ensure no further delays. [sincerely] Thank you for your patience through this, Mr. Davidson, genuinely.
266  [confidently] Five minutes maximum, likely sooner—it's already in the queue. [professionally] Your ticket number for today's call is CSR-10210847 for your records. [warmly] Have a better rest of your day, Mr. Davidson, and [earnestly] again, our sincere apologies for everything.
267  [briskly] Good afternoon, Enterprise Rentals, this is Sandra speaking. [more quickly] How can I assist you with your reservation today? [cheerfully] We've got several options available this week.
268  [reassuring] Oh absolutely, let me pull up our inventory right away. [rapidly] Tomorrow morning pickup, returning when? [pause] And did you have a particular vehicle class in mind, or are you flexible?
269  [sympathetically] I understand completely, no minivans then. [typing quickly] So we have... oh dear, tomorrow's quite booked. [more optimistically] But wait, I do see a mid-size SUV just became available, would that work?
270  [apologetically] Unfortunately our compacts are all reserved through the weekend. [more brightly] However, I could offer you the SUV at the compact rate—manager's discretion. [quickly] That's seventy dollars off the regular price, plus unlimited mileage included.
271  [efficiently] We open at seven, so that gives you plenty of time. [rapidly] I'll need your driver's license number and a major credit card to hold the reservation. [warmly] Also, would you like our insurance coverage, or are you covered through your own policy?
272  [professionally] Perfect, Visa works great. [speaking faster] Ready for the card number when you are. [pause] Oh, and I should mention—we'll need you to return it with the same fuel level, quarter tank currently.
273  [apologetically] I know, it's inconvenient, but with the shortage this week... [more reassuringly] The gauge has clear markings though, and there's a gas station right across the street from us. [helpfully] Most people just eyeball it, we're pretty flexible.
274  [typing rapidly] Excellent, got all that entered. [cheerfully] Your confirmation number is—ready?—R as in Robert, K-7-7-9-9-4. [more slowly] Should I text or email that to you as well?
275  [efficiently] Both it is then, sending those right... now. [briskly] You'll get the text immediately and email within five minutes. [warmly] The SUV's a nice blue Toyota Highlander, very reliable for highway driving.
276  [pleased] Oh, you're very welcome! [quickly] Just bring your license and credit card tomorrow, we'll have everything ready. [cheerfully] The contract takes maybe three minutes to sign, then you're good to go.
277  [Angry] Look, I don't care what everyone thinks—pineapple on pizza is actually, like, the perfect combination of sweet and savory, okay? [Tsk]
278  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because the majority is always right about everything. [Laugh] Remember when everyone thought the earth was flat?
279  [Fast] I've done the research, I've looked at the data, and honestly the numbers don't—they just don't lie about this stuff. [Defensive]
280  [Whisper] Between you and me, I think deep down, um, people actually agree but they're too scared to admit it. [Sigh]
281  [Happy] You know what? I'm glad I believe this! [Laugh] It makes me different and I kinda like standing out from the crowd.
282  [Slow] The thing is... nobody wants to hear it because it challenges what they've believed their whole lives, y'know? [Disappointed]
283  [Shout] Would you just let me finish my point before you—before you jump all over me about it? [Groan]
284  [Sad] I used to keep quiet about it, but I'm just, I'm tired of pretending I agree when I really, really don't. [Sigh]
285  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, another person telling me I'm wrong without actually listening to my reasoning—how original.
286  [Fast] [Happy] Actually wait, wait, wait—I found three studies that basically prove what I'm saying, so it's not just me being weird!
287  [Disappointed] I mean, I thought you of all people would at least, like, try to understand where I'm coming from. [Tsk]
288  [Angry] [Fast] This is exactly why I don't usually bring it up because everyone gets all—they get defensive and won't even consider it!
289  [Chuckle] Honestly? In ten years everyone's gonna pretend they believed this all along. [Sarcastic] Mark my words.
290  [Whisper] [Sad] Sometimes I wonder if I'm actually wrong, but then I remember... no, no, the evidence is there.
291  [Slow] You're allowed to disagree, but, um, dismissing it without even thinking about it? [Disappointed] [Sigh] That's just closed-minded.
292  [Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, finally someone who's willing to actually discuss it instead of just laughing at me!
293  [Groan] Here we go again—I mention it once and suddenly I'm the, the crazy person in the room. [Angry]
294  [Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, let's all just believe the same thing forever and never question anything—that sounds super healthy for society.
295  [Sad] [Slow] I dunno, maybe I'm just seeing something that... that other people can't see yet, or won't see.
296  [Shout] It's not stupid! [Angry] [Fast] Just because it's different doesn't mean—ugh, why do I even bother trying to explain anymore?
297  [frustrated] Oh my god, you have no idea what kind of day I've had. My phone died right when I was supposed to meet Sarah for coffee, and I'm like— I'm standing there like an idiot because I don't even remember where we said to meet exactly. [annoyed] And of course it's one of those days where like, everyone's running late, so I'm just wandering around the whole plaza looking for her, checking every single café. My phone's completely dead, can't call her, can't check my messages, nothing. [increasingly agitated] I'm thinking she probably texted me the exact spot, you know? Or maybe she's trying to call me right now wondering where the hell I am. [sigh] I felt so disconnected, like— God, when did I become so dependent on this stupid thing? [still frustrated but hopeful] So I'm looking around for somewhere to charge it, right? Thinking I'm gonna have to like, go into some store and ask to use their outlet or something awkward like that, and— [surprised] [relieved] Wait, oh my god. There's literally a charging station right here. Right where I'm standing. [half laugh] Like, I've been pacing around this bench for ten minutes complaining and there's just— it's right here. [lighter] [slightly embarrassed] Okay, crisis averted. [chuckle] Sometimes the universe actually does look out for you, I guess.
298  Wait wait wait—you got it? Like, the full amount you were asking for? Oh my god, I'm literally—this is huge! How are you feeling right now?
299  I just—I can't even believe it's finally over, y'know? After everything they put you through, all those depositions and the—ugh, the waiting. [Sigh] You must be so relieved.
300  No no no, that's totally normal though! Like, you've been in fight mode for what—eight months? Nine? Your brain probably doesn't even know how to, like, process that it's actually done.
301  [Laugh] Okay, there's the humor I've been missing! But seriously, um, have you thought about what you're gonna do first? Like, celebrate or just... decompress?
302  God, yes. Sleep is so—that's actually perfect. You've basically been running on fumes and spite, right? Though honestly, the spite served you pretty well in the end.
303  Pleasantly stubborn! That's—that's amazing. I mean, they basically tried to steamroll you and you just... didn't let them. Do you feel like, I dunno, vindicated at all?
304  Yeah, yeah of course. It's probably gonna hit you in like, weird moments, y'know? Like you'll be grocery shopping and suddenly—boom, it'll sink in that you actually won.
305  Oh babe—wait, at the lawyer's office? That's so... [Chuckle] honestly that's kinda perfect though. Better than crying in, like, the cereal aisle or something.
306  Aw, that's actually really sweet though. But um, for real—you know this was the right outcome, right? Like, they owed you this. You didn't just win, you deserved to win.
307  Yeah, no, I get that. The kind of tired that's like—it's in your bones, right? But hey, you did it. You literally did the thing. And I'm so, so proud of you.
308  [muttering] Okay, so, um, so I need laundry detergent. Simple, right? But there's— there's literally two of the exact same thing here and I'm, uh, I'm standing here like an idiot trying to figure out which— [sigh] they're both the same brand, same size, same scent. [slightly puzzled] Wait, let me just— okay, this one's $4.99 and this one's... $4.97? Two cents? Really? That's, um, that's what we're dealing with here? I mean, it's two cents, but like, two cents is two cents, right? [rambling] But maybe the cheaper one is, uh, is older stock or something? Like, maybe it's been sitting here longer and that's why— no, that doesn't— that doesn't make sense. It's detergent, not, um, not produce. [deadpan] Oh wait. [laugh] Oh my god. One of them has a coupon thing stuck to it. A little, uh, a little yellow sticker that says "Save 50 cents!" So it's actually more expensive. Cool. [resigned] You know what? I'm just gonna grab this one and, um, and call it a day. My clothes will be clean either way, and I've already spent way too much brain power on— on laundry soap. [exhale] Priorities, right?
309  [defensively] I sold another painting last week, Mom. [quieter] That's three this month. [building excitement] The gallery owner says my work has "raw emotional depth" and wants to feature me in their next group show!
310  [hurt whisper] You've never understood art. [louder] It's not about immediate profit—it's about building a reputation, creating a body of work that matters. [pleading] Van Gogh only sold one painting in his lifetime!
311  [angrily] Jennifer's dead inside! She hates her job, [trembling] takes anxiety medication just to get through Monday meetings. [softer] I wake up excited about my work. [firmly] Isn't happiness worth something to you?
312  [desperately fast] I'm applying for grants, teaching workshops on weekends, [breath catching] even doing pet portraits for extra cash. [determined] I'm not just sitting around dreaming—I'm working harder than I ever did at that office job!
313  [voice breaking] Dad would have understood. [stronger] He always said to follow your passion. [accusatory] You're the one who crushed his dreams of opening that restaurant, [whispered] made him stay at the bank until he died.
314  [gentle] Maybe you're right about Dad. [steadier] But I watched him fade away in that cubicle, Mom. [passionate whisper] I can't become that—another ghost shuffling through life, counting days until retirement.
315  [thoughtfully slow] What if I compromise? [hopeful] I'll get a part-time job—something flexible. [eagerly] But I keep my studio, keep creating. [firm] Give me one year to make this work professionally. Just one year, Mom.
316  [frustrated groan] This time is different! I have momentum, [quickly] real connections, actual buyers! [desperately sincere] The art world moves slowly, but it's moving for me. [quiet intensity] Can't you see I'm finally becoming something?
317  [defensive laugh] I'm not starving! [warmly] Actually, I've never felt more alive. [contemplative] Sure, things are tight, but I'm building something real here. [passionate] My art is finally authentic because I'm living it fully.
318  [quietly confident] She'd understand sacrifice for something you love. [building strength] Grandma always said the biggest risk was living someone else's life. [lovingly firm] I'm not abandoning stability, Mom—I'm just defining it differently than you do.
319  [apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration completely. [calmly] Let me pull up your account—can you confirm your member ID starting with JX-5? [reassuring] We'll definitely get this sorted out today, I promise.
320  [more firmly] I see you've had multiple replacements, yes. [sympathetic] The system shows two prior exchanges on October 3rd and October 11th. [confused] But, um, there's no defect report filed for the second unit—did anyone test it here?
321  [defensive] Sir, our diagnostic process requires at least fifteen minutes per device. [more calmly] Let me... let me run a quick diagnostic now. [professionally] Could you show me exactly what happens when you press the power button for ten seconds?
322  [hesitant] Unfortunately, the warranty only covers same-model replacements. [more sympathetically] However, I can see your frustration is... is completely justified here. [thoughtfully] Let me call my district manager at extension 5509 for an exception approval.
323  [shocked] Oh my goodness, that's... that's terrible! [more determinedly] You know what, forget the call—I'm authorizing a full refund right now, credit back to card ending in 7734. [confidently] Plus, we'll upgrade you to the X48-C at no extra charge.
324  [briskly] Good afternoon, thank you for calling Skyline Airlines customer service, my name is Rachel. [more quickly] How may I assist you with your reservation today?
325  [efficiently] Certainly, I can help you with that. [quickly] May I have your confirmation number please, and [more deliberately] the last name on the reservation?
326  [rapidly] Alright Mr. Thompson, I'm pulling up your reservation now, just one moment. [brisk] I see you're currently assigned to 28B, that's a middle seat. [questioning] Were you looking to change to an aisle or window?
327  [quickly scanning] Let me check availability for you. [faster] We have 15C, 22D, and [slowing down] oh wait, actually 9C just opened up, that's much closer to the front.
328  [reassuring] No sir, 9C is standard economy, no additional charge. [briskly] Shall I go ahead and assign that seat to you? [quickly] I just need to confirm before the system locks it.
329  [rapid-fire] Alright, I've successfully updated your seat to 9C, aisle seat, left side of the aircraft. [efficient] You'll receive an email confirmation within the next five minutes with your updated boarding pass.
330  [professionally] I'd need her confirmation number to access that reservation. [quickly] For privacy reasons, I can't search by name alone, but [helpfully] if you have her booking reference, I can check.
331  [briskly] That works perfectly, sir. [rapid] Just have her mention she wants to sit near passenger Thompson in 9C when she calls. [efficiently] Our agents can check nearby availability.
332  [cheerfully] My pleasure, Mr. Thompson! [quickly] Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your flight or [speeding up] any other reservations today?
333  [laughing] I wish I had that power, sir! [briskly] But I can confirm your flight is currently showing on-time. [rapid] You'll get text updates if anything changes, since I see you opted in for notifications.
334  [Disappointed] Okay so, um, maybe if I just—no, that's making it worse. [Sigh] I should've left it alone.
335  [Fast] [Angry] This is ridiculous, I barely touched the thing and it just completely fell apart! How was I supposed to know it was that fragile?
336  [Whisper] Nobody has to know about this if I can just, uh, get it back together before they notice. [Tsk]
337  [Sarcastic] Oh great, now there's three pieces instead of two—I'm really crushing this whole repair thing, aren't I? [Groan]
338  [Happy] Wait wait wait, I think I actually—yes! [Laugh] That part goes there, I'm a genius!
339  [Slow] [Sad] This was, like, their favorite thing in the world and I just... I completely destroyed it.
340  [Shout] Where's the stupid glue when you actually need it?! [Angry] I swear it was right here yesterday!
341  [Chuckle] You know what, honestly, it kinda looks better broken—gives it character, right? [Sarcastic]
342  [Fast] [Whisper] Quick quick quick, they're gonna be home in like twenty minutes and I still haven't even figured out how this goes back together.
343  [Disappointed] [Sigh] I mean, I tried watching three different YouTube tutorials but none of them are for this exact model.
344  [Slow] So basically what happened was—actually, you don't wanna know what happened, trust me. [Tsk] [Sad]
345  [Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, super glue is literally magic, you can't even tell anything happened to it!
346  [Angry] [Groan] Every single time I try to fix something, I somehow make it ten times worse than before.
347  [Whisper] [Chuckle] If anyone asks, it was already like this when I got here, okay?
348  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, the instructions say "easy assembly" but they probably didn't account for someone reassembling it after, um, an incident.
349  [Sad] I can't believe I'm gonna have to tell them I broke it—they trusted me with this. [Disappointed] [Sigh]
350  [Shout] [Happy] It's working! The thing is actually—oh wait, nope, it just fell off again.
351  [Fast] [Tsk] Maybe duct tape isn't the most elegant solution but at this point I just need it to hold together for like five minutes.
352  [Slow] [Disappointed] Twenty dollars says they notice immediately, even if I do manage to kinda sorta fix it.
353  [Angry] Why do they make these things so impossibly delicate?! [Fast] I mean, who designs something that shatters if you breathe on it wrong?
354  [frustrated] Oh my god, I am so done with Sarah right now. Like, we had this huge presentation due today and she basically just— she disappeared for the last three days. Didn't answer emails, didn't show up to our planning meeting yesterday, nothing. [annoyed] So I'm scrambling, right? I'm putting together slides at like midnight last night because I thought she was gonna handle the budget section, and then I get to work this morning and she's just— nowhere to be found. I had to wing half of it in front of the clients. [building frustration] And the thing is, this isn't like the first time with her. She always does this thing where she's super enthusiastic at the beginning and then just... [sigh] I don't know, checks out when it actually matters? [irritated] I probably looked like such an idiot up there. Mr. Chen was asking all these detailed questions about the numbers and I'm like, um, let me get back to you on that because my partner who was supposed to— [surprised] Oh wait, she's... she's calling me right now. Hold on. [quieter] [confused] She says her dad had a heart attack? Like, yesterday morning, and she's been at the hospital this whole time and her phone died and... [guilty] [softly] Oh god. I feel horrible. She's been dealing with that and I was just— [half laugh] I was literally about to go complain to our boss about her.
355  Oh my god. Oh my god, I—wait, that was today? I thought—no no no, I'm so sorry. I completely spaced, I thought it was next Saturday.
356  You waited? Shit, I—I'm the worst. I'm literally the worst friend ever. I was with my cousin and we just—I dunno, time got away from me and I wasn't checking my phone. [groan] This is so bad.
357  No, I know how that sounds but she's only in town for like—that's not an excuse. That's totally not an excuse, I know. I shoulda checked my calendar, I shoulda remembered. We've been planning this for weeks.
358  Three weeks. Yeah. God, I just—I don't know what's wrong with me lately. I've been so scattered and I keep—I keep doing this thing where I double-book myself and it's not fair to anyone. [nervous laugh] Especially not to you.
359  I know. I know it is, and that makes it so much worse, right? Like once is bad enough but twice is—that's a pattern. That's me being a terrible friend who doesn't prioritize you and I hate that. I really, really hate that.
360  Um, I mean—can I make it up to you? Like tomorrow or—or whenever you're free? I'll cancel whatever I have, I swear. Actually wait, let me just—let me check right now so I don't mess up again.
361  That's—yeah, that's fair. [sigh] That's completely fair. I wouldn't wanna make plans with me either. But I promise I can—I can do better. I bought a planner! Like an actual physical one so I can't just ignore notifications.
362  You're right. You're totally right, it's not—it's not about the planner, it's about me not being present, y'know? Not valuing our friendship the way I should. And I do value it, I swear I do, I'm just really bad at showing it apparently.
363  I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better. Not just say it but actually do it. Like, our next plan? I'm putting it in my phone, my planner, telling my roommate to remind me. Whatever it takes. Because losing you as a friend would just—that would break me, honestly.
364  I do mean it. I know I've—I've given you reasons to doubt me but I really, truly mean it. You're one of my best friends and I've been taking you for granted and that stops now. It has to.
365  [muttering] Okay, so I need the, um— where did they put the cereal? I swear it used to be, like, right here on the— on the middle shelf, but now it's just... [sigh] of course. Of course it's not there. [slightly annoyed] Let me just— let me look around here. Maybe they moved it to, um, to a different... [tsk] nope. Not there either. This is, uh, this is why I hate when they reorganize the whole— the whole grocery store layout. [resigned] Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [drawn out] Up there. It's up there, isn't it? On the very top shelf. Because why would it be, um, why would it be anywhere a normal person could reach it? [determined but wary] Okay, so I just need to— I mean, how hard can it be? I'll just, uh, I'll stretch up and... [grunt] nope. Nope, that's not— that's not happening. My arms are apparently too short for, um, for modern grocery shopping. [contemplative] Do I ask someone? I could ask that guy over there, but he looks busy and I don't want to— [hmm] or maybe there's like a step stool or something? Do stores have those? [accepting] You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm gonna grab a different cereal. The universe is clearly telling me to try something new today. [laugh] Or maybe it's telling me to grow taller, but that ship has, uh, that ship has sailed.
366  [Screaming] OH MY GOD, IS THAT—NO WAY! [gasping] You got the constellation too?! [voice cracking with joy] I literally just got mine done yesterday, I was going to surprise you at dinner but this is absolutely insane!
367  [trembling whisper] This can't be real. [building excitement] We didn't plan this, we didn't even— [explosive laugh] Wait, did you go to Midnight Ink too? Please tell me you went to Jake, the guy with the purple mohawk!
368  [choked up] Remember when we were fifteen? [steadier] We swore on your mom's porch swing that we'd get matching tattoos someday. [whispered awe] But we never decided what, and somehow we both chose Cassiopeia independently.
369  [frantically] It's in my bag somewhere— [sharp intake] Oh wait, look closer at yours! [hushed amazement] Do you see that tiny star near the bottom point? Mine has that too, it wasn't even in the original design!
370  [giddy laughter] Mom's going to lose her mind when she finds out. [sarcastically sweet] "You two share a brain cell," she always says. [earnest shout] But this proves we share a soul—we're basically telepathic!
371  [wobbly voice] Don't make me cry in this coffee shop! [laughing through tears] Everyone's already staring because we screamed like banshees. [quietly intense] I vote we make this our thing—spontaneous twin decisions forever.
372  [groaning] The worst pain ever! [animated] I literally had to bite my jacket sleeve during that section. [dropping lower] But Jake kept saying "beauty is pain, darling" in that ridiculous accent of his.
373  [thoughtfully soft] You know what's crazy? [building energy] Last week I had this vivid dream about stars aligning on our shoulders. [mysterious whisper] I thought it was just random subconscious nonsense, but maybe not.
374  [reverent] We need to celebrate this properly. [excitedly faster] Champagne, terrible karaoke, the works! [shouting] Tonight we're telling everyone the story of the telepathic tattoo miracle, whether they want to hear it or not!
375  [breathless rush] Quick, let's take a picture with them visible! [commanding] Stand back to back—no wait, side by side! [giddy] We're going to break the internet with this twin magic situation we've created!
376  [apologetic] Oh dear, I'm so sorry to hear about your antiques, sir. [professionally] Let me pull up your file—B-47291-X, you said? [reassuring tone] I see here the move was completed on October 15th, and yes, there's a damage report filed.
377  [calmly] Sir, I completely understand your frustration, and we take these matters very seriously. [sympathetic] According to our records, you purchased our Premium Protection Plan for $289. [more firmly] Let me transfer you to our claims specialist, extension 4-0-7, who can discuss compensation options.
378  [nervous] Forty-seven thousand? [pause] [more composed] Sir, our maximum coverage under the Premium Plan is, um, $15,000 per shipment. [carefully] However, if you have documentation—receipts, appraisals dated before September 30th—we can certainly escalate this to management.
379  [defensive] Our drivers' acknowledgments are absolutely binding, sir. [more confidently] Let me check—yes, Marcus Williams, employee M-2094, did note "antique collection" on the manifest. [helpful tone] Can you email your documentation to claims@safemove.com, attention case B-47291-X?
380  [sighs] [apologetically] You're right, our response time has been unacceptable. [determined] I'm personally escalating this to our regional manager, Sandra Chen, right now. [reassuring] She'll contact you within 24 hours at—let me confirm—is 555-0147 still your best number?
381  [cheerfully] Good afternoon, FitLife Gym, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today?
382  [apologetically] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that inconvenience. [more quickly] Let me just pull up our maintenance log here to see what's—um—what's happening with that equipment.
383  [defensively] I understand your frustration, sir, and I can see here that—[pause]—well, actually, there's no record of previous calls about the leg press. [more softly] Are you sure you called us about this specific machine?
384  [quickly] Sir, I'll definitely make note of this right now, and—[more firmly]—I can assure you we take these issues seriously. Our maintenance team should be able to look at it by... let me check... Monday afternoon.
385  [nervously] I know it's not ideal, but our technician only comes twice a week and he's—[clears throat]—he's already booked for Friday. [more hopefully] Would you like a complimentary day pass for another location?
386  [hesitantly] Well, our policy doesn't typically allow for credits due to equipment issues, but—[pause]—let me speak with my manager. [quickly] Can you hold for just one moment?
387  [briskly] Okay, I'm back! [cheerfully] Good news—my manager approved a fifteen dollar credit for this month's inconvenience.
388  [interrupting quickly] Sir, I can add those to our maintenance list right now! [more sympathetically] I know it's been frustrating, and honestly, we've had some staffing issues with our maintenance crew lately.
389  [professionally] Absolutely, I'm documenting everything we discussed today under your account. [rapidly] That's the leg press, cable machine, and water fountain on the main floor, correct?
390  [reassuringly] Got it all noted here, and I'm sending an urgent flag to maintenance about that door—that's definitely a safety issue. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help you with today?
391  [Happy] Oh wow, this is, uh, this is really something! [Nervous laugh] I mean, you definitely put a lot of thought into this, didn't you?
392  [Slow] It's so... unique. [Tsk] I've literally never seen anything quite like it before in my entire life.
393  [Fast] You shouldn't have—no really, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble! [Chuckle] Must've been hard to find!
394  [Whisper] Where am I even gonna put this thing? [Sigh] I guess I could maybe rearrange the whole living room or something.
395  [Sarcastic] Perfect, this is exactly what I needed to complete my collection of, um, of things. [Disappointed] Thanks so much.
396  [Sad] I'm just—I'm kinda overwhelmed right now, you know? [Slow] This is a lot to take in, honestly.
397  [Angry] No, no, I love it! [Fast] Why would you think I don't love it? I'm smiling, aren't I?
398  [Happy] How did you even know I wanted one of these? [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Must be psychic or something, right?
399  [Disappointed] Oh. [Long pause] [Slow] This is the one from that store we passed last month, isn't it?
400  [Shout] SURPRISE! [Nervous laugh] [Fast] Wait, that's what I'm supposed to say? Or—never mind, thank you!
401  [Whisper] Is there a gift receipt in here somewhere, or... [Tsk] [Fast] Just wondering about the warranty, that's all!
402  [Slow] You know what? [Sigh] I'm gonna treasure this forever and ever, I really mean that.
403  [Angry] This must've cost you a fortune! [Disappointed] You really, really didn't need to spend money on—on this.
404  [Fast] I can't wait to show everyone what you got me! [Sarcastic] They're gonna be so jealous, I bet.
405  [Happy] I'm speechless, literally cannot find the words right now! [Groan] [Whisper] Because what would I even say?
406  [Sad] It reminds me of something my grandmother used to have, actually. [Chuckle] Different color though, thankfully—I mean, luckily!
407  [Shout] You remembered! [Fast] From that one conversation six months ago where I definitely didn't say I hated these!
408  [Disappointed] Hmm, interesting choice. [Slow] I guess this is what you think of when you think of me, huh?
409  [Sarcastic] Gotta say, this is almost as good as last year's gift! [Laugh] Remember that disaster—I mean, that lovely surprise?
410  [Whisper] I'm gonna need a minute to, uh, to process this properly. [Sigh] [Slow] It's just so much more than I expected, y'know?
411  [frustrated] Ugh, so I went to pick up my prescription today and it was like— it was like a forty-five minute wait. Forty-five minutes! For something that should take like two seconds, you know? [annoyed] And they kept calling people who came in after me, and I'm just standing there like an idiot watching everyone else get their stuff. The pharmacist kept disappearing into the back for like ten minutes at a time, and I'm thinking, what are you doing back there? [scoff] Making the pills from scratch? [irritated] I had to miss my lunch break for this, and I'm getting more and more annoyed, and finally when they call my name I'm just like, thank God, let's get this over with. I just want to grab it and leave. [surprised] [suddenly attentive] But then— wait, so the pharmacist looks at my bag and she's like, "Hold on, what other medications are you taking?" And I tell her about the stuff my doctor prescribed last week for my back, and her face just— her face completely changes. [quieter] [a bit shaken] She goes, "Oh no, you can't take these together. This could cause serious heart problems." Like, serious heart problems. My doctor's office never— they never checked, they just wrote the prescription. [grateful] [slightly overwhelmed] So that forty-five minute wait that I was so mad about? It like— it might have actually saved my life. God, I feel terrible for being so rude to her now.
412  Wait wait wait—finished what? Oh my god, is this about the—the thing you've been working on?
413  Holy—okay, I'm literally gonna cry right now. You actually did it? Like, the whole thing? Beginning, middle, end, all of it?
414  Three hundred and— [Gasp] that's like, that's a real book! An actual real book that you wrote with your own brain and everything!
415  No no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you minimize it, okay? This is huge. Like, do you know how many people say they're gonna write a novel and then just... don't?
416  Exactly! And you're not—you're not one of them anymore. You're like, officially a novelist now. How does it feel? Are you, I dunno, relieved? Excited?
417  Oh babe, I bet. When did you—actually wait, when did you even finish? Was it last night? Is that why you look kinda [Chuckle] zombie-ish today?
418  Three in the—okay that's so dramatic and perfect though, right? Like, finishing your first novel in the middle of the night? That's literally how it happens in movies!
419  Well yeah, but—but that's tomorrow's problem, y'know? Today you just gotta, like, let yourself actually feel proud of this. Have you told anyone else yet?
420  Just—oh. [Softer] Oh wow, okay, that's... I'm really honored actually. Like really, really honored. Can I—would it be weird if I asked what it's about?
421  Not really ghosts? That sounds—honestly that sounds exactly like something you'd write. Mysterious and kinda dark but probably, like, secretly really emotional underneath, right?
422  [muttering] Okay, so, um, how hard can this be, right? It's just a— it's just a sheet. I mean, people do this all the time, it's not like, uh, it's not like rocket science or whatever. [slightly uncertain] So I've got the, um, the corners here, and I think— I think you're supposed to put the corners together? Like, corner to corner, and then, uh— [sigh] wait, which corners though? [getting frustrated] Okay, no, that's not— that's not right. Now it's all bunched up and weird and it looks like a, um, like a fabric burrito or something. [nervous laugh] This is, uh, this is not how fitted sheets are supposed to look. [determined] Let me just— let me start over. There's gotta be a system here, right? Like, elastic corner goes with elastic corner, and then you, um, you fold it in half, and then— [deflated] [groan] It's doing that weird inside-out thing again. You know what? You know what, maybe this is just— maybe this is just how fitted sheets live now. In a, uh, in a vaguely rectangular blob shape. [resigned but amused] I'm just gonna shove it in the closet and pretend it's, um, pretend it's folded. Close enough, right? [weak laugh] Martha Stewart would probably cry, but, uh, Martha Stewart's not doing my laundry, so...
423  [dismissively] Oh come on, one night won't kill you! [enthusiastic] I'm ordering the cheese platter, garlic bread, and [getting louder] that incredible chocolate lava cake. [Snort] Life's too short to eat rabbit food.
424  [wheedling tone] But it's Friday! [faster] We always share the spinach artichoke dip on Fridays, remember? [Dramatic sigh] Plus, I can't eat all that bread alone—[pleading] you're making me look like a glutton here!
425  [sarcastically sweet] One piece of bread, how rebellious. [Scoff] Remember when we used to demolish entire pizzas together? [wistful] Those were the days. [sharper] Now you're all kale smoothies and counting almonds.
426  [grudgingly impressed] Okay, that's actually pretty cool. [Pause] [more enthusiastic] But you're celebrating tonight, right? [coaxing] Winners deserve victory meals! [Giggle] Come on, split the pasta special with me—it's practically a marathon medal!
427  [triumphant] Aha! So you DO want dessert! [teasing] The diet fortress has a crack! [Cackle] I'm ordering two spoons for that lava cake. [smugly] Your willpower never stands a chance against melted chocolate.
428  [skeptical] Right, because one bite always stays one bite. [knowing tone] Remember the "one chip" incident at Sandra's party? [Loud laugh] You ate the entire bowl! [affectionately] Just admit you miss our food adventures together.
429  [softening] Hey, I didn't mean to make this heavy. [apologetic] You looked great then, you look great now. [Gentle sigh] I just—[trailing off] I guess I feel like we don't connect the same way anymore.
430  [brightening] That's true! [excited again] Speaking of stories, wait till you hear about the sushi place I found. [mysteriously] They do this thing with torched salmon—[dreamily] it's basically butter that swims.
431  [resigned laugh] Fine, you win with your reasonable compromise. [mock serious] But I'm still ordering that lava cake. [whispered conspiracy] And I'm leaving the spoons where [sing-song voice] you can reach them easily.
432  [proudly] Enabler is such a harsh word. [philosophical tone] I prefer "curator of life's pleasures." [Warm chuckle] Now let's order before I faint—[dramatically] your talk of vegetables is making me dizzy with hunger!
433  [apologetic] I'm terribly sorry to hear about this situation, Mr...let me pull up your account. [calmly] K-4-7-2-9-B-6, you said? [concerned] I see here we've had multiple dispatches logged, and I completely understand your frustration.
434  [sympathetic] That must be incredibly disruptive to your family's sleep. [professionally] I'm seeing sensor 14-B in your living room triggered at that exact time. [reassuring] We can definitely recalibrate the sensitivity settings, and I'll also apply a credit of $150 to your account.
435  [understanding] Those dispatch codes can certainly create misunderstandings with neighbors, absolutely. [more confidently] What I can do right now is file report TX-88901-C to clear those false alarms from your record. [helpfully] Would you also like me to schedule a technician for tomorrow?
436  [quickly] Let me check today's availability in your 78704 area code. [pause] [optimistic] Actually, I have Carlos, technician ID 5522, who can be there between 2:00 and 4:00 PM. [courteously] Would that window work for you, or should I check evening slots?
437  [confidently] Carlos is one of our senior technicians with eight years experience. [reassuring] He'll run full diagnostic protocol P-7-7-A on all 16 of your sensors. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any other concerns about your system?
438  [cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling MediCare Insurance, my name is Sandra. [quickly] How can I assist you today with your healthcare needs?
439  [sympathetically] Oh, I understand how frustrating that must be. [briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick—can I have your member ID and date of birth please?
440  [typing tone] Alright, I see your account here, and yes, there is a prior auth request. [quickly] It looks like it was submitted on the tenth, then again on the eighteenth, and [hesitantly] um, it's showing as still under clinical review.
441  [more apologetically] I completely understand your concern, sir. [rapidly] What happens is our clinical team reviews these requests within five to seven business days, but [pause] sometimes they need additional documentation from your provider.
442  [defensively] Well, sometimes they need specific test results or [quickly] they might want to try a different medication first—it's called step therapy. [more gently] Have you tried the generic alternative before?
443  [regretfully] I wish I could approve it directly, but I'm not part of the clinical team. [briskly] What I can do is escalate this to urgent status, which should get you a response within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
444  [quickly] I can definitely get you to a supervisor, but just so you know, they'll have the same system access I do. [more hopefully] However, let me first try calling the prior auth department directly while you're on hold—sometimes that helps.
445  [reassuringly] I completely understand, and I'm making detailed notes about your situation. [rapidly] Please hold for just a moment while I contact them directly—I'll be back in two to three minutes, okay?
446  [more cheerfully] Hi Mr. Johnson, good news! [quickly] I spoke with the prior auth team and they're expediting your case—they actually just need one clarification about dosage from your doctor.
447  [apologetically] I know it seems redundant, but they need it specifically noted in the prior auth form, not just the prescription. [briskly] If your doctor's office can fax that today, we can have approval by tomorrow morning.
448  [Happy] So, um, I've known Sarah since we were like seven, and she—she always said she'd never get married, right? [Laugh] Look at her now!
449  [Slow] [Whisper] I remember the exact moment John told me about you—he couldn't stop smiling, just couldn't stop.
450  [Chuckle] Honestly, when these two first started dating, I was like—wait, him? Really? [Happy] But now I totally get it.
451  [Sad] [Sigh] Mom would've loved to see this day, she really would've, and I know she's—she's here with us somehow.
452  [Fast] Okay so basically what I'm trying to say is you guys are perfect together and I'm not crying, you're crying! [Laugh]
453  [Disappointed] I had this whole speech prepared, but I, uh, I left it in the hotel and now I'm just—I'm winging it. [Tsk]
454  [Shout] [Happy] To the bride and groom—may your love story be even better than, um, than all those rom-coms she makes us watch!
455  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, Mike said it would be a small wedding, just family, y'know? [Chuckle] Three hundred people later...
456  [Angry] [Fast] And another thing—whoever decided to seat me next to my ex at table twelve, we're gonna have words later!
457  [Slow] Marriage is, I mean, it's not just about the good times, right? [Sad] It's about holding each other through everything.
458  [Happy] [Shout] Did everyone see that first dance? That was—wow! They've been practicing for months!
459  [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda thought he'd never settle down, but then—then Emma happened. [Chuckle]
460  [Sigh] So I'm supposed to be funny here, but I'm just—I'm too emotional, okay? [Happy] You guys are literally everything.
461  [Fast] [Angry] Wait wait wait, before I continue, can someone please get Uncle Ted away from the chocolate fountain?
462  [Disappointed] I was gonna tell that story about Vegas, but apparently that's "inappropriate" for a wedding toast? [Sarcastic] [Tsk]
463  [Slow] The thing about true love is—actually, you know what? [Happy] Just look at them, that's all you need to know.
464  [Groan] [Sad] I promised myself I wouldn't cry during this speech, but here we are, and I'm—I'm a complete mess.
465  [Chuckle] Remember when you said you'd never date a lawyer? [Sarcastic] How's that working out for ya?
466  [Whisper] [Slow] Twenty years from now, I hope you remember this moment, this feeling, this—this perfect day.
467  [Fast] [Happy] Alright everyone, I'm done rambling—let's raise our glasses to love, laughter, and happily ever after! [Shout] Cheers!
468  [casual] Oh yeah, and I've been, um, I've been using this same water bottle all week. You know, the, uh, the blue one? Just keep refilling it, keep refilling it. Very, um, very environmentally conscious of me, right? [matter-of-fact] I mean it's— it's fine, it's just water, you know? I rinse it out sometimes when I, um, when I remember to. But like, water's water, it's not— it's not like I'm putting, uh, putting milk in there or something gross. [slight concern] Actually, now that I'm— now that I'm thinking about it, I can't really, um, I can't remember the last time I actually washed it. Like, uh, like properly washed it with soap and— [pause] Wait, hang on. [growing unease] Oh. Oh no. There's like— there's like little, um, little floaty things in here. And the bottom is— [sharp exhale] oh god, the bottom is like, uh, it's slimy? There's this weird film and I can see— I can see like chunks of something. [disgusted realization] How long have I been— [groan] how long have I been drinking this? I've been, um, I've been chugging this thing for days! There's literally— there's mold! There's actual mold growing in— [gag] oh my god, I can smell it now. [spiraling disgust] I'm gonna be sick. I'm literally— I'm gonna throw up. I've been, uh, I've been basically drinking swamp water for who knows how long and I just— [whimper] why didn't I look? Why don't I ever— [frustrated groan] This is so disgusting, I can't— I can't even—
469  Wait wait wait—are you serious? Oh my god, that's—that's incredible! I mean, I knew you were getting close but like, actually hitting it? How do you feel?
470  Oh. Yeah, no, I—I totally get that. It's like when you build something up in your head for so long and then... [Sigh] But still, this is huge, right? Like, you've been working at this for what, a year?
471  Fourteen months! That's—okay that's literally dedication. Most people would've given up after like, I dunno, three weeks? Did you, um, did you celebrate at all?
472  You made—okay no no no, we're not doing that. We gotta actually celebrate this! Because honestly? This is the kind of thing that deserves, like, champagne or—or at least a really good dinner somewhere fancy.
473  It's not though! It's—I mean yeah, technically it's a number but it's also like... all those early mornings, all those times you said no to stuff, all the—[Laugh] remember when you meal prepped for like three hours every Sunday?
474  Right, exactly! And that's what I'm saying—you basically changed your whole life, y'know? That's not just a number, that's like... that's you being really brave, actually.
475  No but it is though! Because like, changing habits is literally one of the hardest things humans can do. There's actual science about it. And you just... did it anyway.
476  Oh my god, the shopping—wait, annoying? Are you kidding? Getting to buy clothes that actually fit how you want them to? That's gotta feel at least a little bit good, right? [Chuckle] Come on, give me something here.
477  The jeans are nice! Okay okay, we're getting somewhere. What else? Like, energy-wise or—or just day to day stuff, is anything different?
478  See? That's—that's what I'm talking about! Those aren't small things, those are like, quality of life things. Your knees were basically holding you hostage before, remember? And now they're just... not. That's pretty amazing if you ask me.
479  Oh god, okay—I know, I know what you're gonna say. I was being way too pushy about the drinks thing and I—I'm sorry, alright? I didn't mean to make it weird.
480  You're right, you're totally right. It's been—I've been doing it for weeks haven't I? [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. I just thought we were having fun and I didn't realize—
481  I know! I know you did and I just kept—ugh, I kept being like "come on, just one" and that's so not okay. That's literally the opposite of okay. I wasn't thinking about how it made you feel.
482  No, I—I mean, I'm starting to get it now. You shouldn't have to defend your choice every single time we go out, that's—[groan] that's so messed up of me. You must dread hanging out with me.
483  Oh. That's—wow. Okay, that really... I didn't know it was that bad. I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry. I thought I was just being, like, encouraging or whatever but I was actually just being a terrible friend, wasn't I?
484  I don't! I mean—I guess I do but not like—it's stupid, honestly. I think I just wanted us to be doing the same thing? Like bonding or whatever? But that's my issue, not yours, and I should've—I should've respected your boundaries.
485  You're absolutely right. God, when you put it like that it sounds so—I wasn't trying to force anything but I guess that's exactly what I was doing, huh? Just bulldozing right over what you wanted because I thought I knew better or something. [sigh]
486  No no no, you don't, you really don't. And I wasn't—okay maybe I was acting like you did need my approval which is so arrogant and just—ugh. I promise I'll stop. Like completely stop. No more comments, no more "just one drink" stuff, nothing.
487  I know, but—okay wait, hear me out. This time I actually get it? Like really get it? Before I was just saying sorry to smooth things over but now I understand that I was making you feel judged and uncomfortable and—that's not the kind of friend I wanna be.
488  Yeah, of course, that's—that's totally fair. And I want that too, y'know? Just us having fun without me being weird about what's in your glass. I'll do better, I swear. Can we—can we try again? I promise I'll actually listen this time.
489  [muttering] Okay, so I need to, um— I need to respond to this email from Sarah, but like, do I start with "Hi Sarah" or do I just, uh, just jump right into it? I mean, she didn't— she didn't use a greeting when she emailed me, so maybe— [uncertain] But that feels weird, right? Like, I don't know, it feels kind of, um, kind of rude to just be like "Here's the report" without any, uh, without any sort of... acknowledgment? [hmm] Although, I mean, we literally just talked about this yesterday, so it's not like— [slightly faster] Wait, but what if she thinks I'm being too, um, too formal? Like, "Hi Sarah" might be— might be overkill for something this quick. It's just, uh, it's just an attachment, really. Super straightforward. [indecisive] Ugh, why am I— why am I overthinking this? [sigh] It's literally two words. "Hi Sarah." Takes half a second to type. [resigned] You know what? I'm just— I'm just gonna do the greeting. Better to be, um, better to be too polite than... whatever the opposite of that is. [laugh] There. Done.
490  [bitter laugh] Don't remind me. [through gritted teeth] Three months of surveillance, thousands in resources, and for what? [voice breaking] My daughter asked if I'm bad at my job—what am I supposed to tell her?
491  [quietly seething] You saw that smile on the security footage? [voice rising] That smug, knowing smile before he disappeared? [shouting] He KNEW we were watching! Knew exactly where every camera was positioned!
492  [explosive yell] ENOUGH! [steadying breath] I'm done playing by the book! [determined growl] Next time we get close, protocol goes out the window—I'll tackle him myself if I have to.
493  [trembling with fury] He left another note. [pause] [disgusted] "Better luck next time, detectives." [roaring] BETTER LUCK?! This isn't a game! People are dying while he taunts us!
494  [quiet rage] My partner quit yesterday. [more intensely] Said the case was cursed, impossible. [exploding] But I won't quit! I'll catch him if it takes everything I have left!
495  [cold fury] Don't you dare give up. [building volume] We've got DNA now, witness sketches, patterns emerging. [fierce determination] He'll slip up—they always do—and when he does, we'll be ready.
496  [through tears] Those three kids he killed last month... [shaking voice] Their parents call me daily. [screaming] DAILY! Asking why their babies' killer is still walking free while they plan funerals!
497  [hoarse whisper] You know what kills me? [rising pitch] He's probably watching the news right now, laughing. [bellowing] LAUGHING at our press conferences where we promise justice we can't deliver!
498  [raw emotion] Seven victims. [voice breaking] Seven families destroyed. [furious roar] And all we have are breadcrumbs he deliberately leaves, playing puppet master while we dance to his sick tune!
499  [grim laugh] You're right. [ice cold] No more rules, no more playing nice. [venomous whisper] Next time we meet, only one of us walks away—and it won't be him.
500  [reassuring] Okay, let's tackle this systematically—F21 indicates a long drain time issue, while F02 is, uh, a drain problem too. [thoughtfully] Can you tell me your model number? [more clearly] It should be on a sticker inside the door frame.
501  [encouragingly] Actually, yes, cleaning the drain filter was perfect! [more seriously] Now, when you removed it, did you notice any coins, bobby pins, or—this is common—sock pieces? [chuckles softly] The WFW9250 series tends to eat small items.
502  [calmly] No, no, E01 just means the door wasn't latched properly during that cycle. [more technical tone] Let's focus on the drainage—can you run diagnostic mode? [instructively] Press Control, then Signal, then Delay Start, then Signal again.
503  [pleased] Perfect, you're in diagnostic mode! Press Start, and it'll cycle through tests—C:01 through C:08. [more specifically] When it hits C:03, that's the pump test. [alertly] Tell me if you hear grinding or if water actually drains.
504  [sympathetically] Yeah, that grinding confirms there's still debris in the pump assembly. [decisively] You'll need to access the pump directly—not just the filter. [helpfully] Can you schedule a service call? [more gently] Your warranty code should be SR-2019-4821-WFW if it's still active.
505  [professionally] Good afternoon, thank you for calling Riverside Pharmacy. [more quickly] My name is Sarah, how can I—oh, I see you're calling about a prescription issue?
506  [sympathetically] I understand how frustrating that must be. [briskly] Let me pull up your file right away—can you give me your date of birth and the medication name?
507  [quickly] Okay, I see the rejection here, it's showing a prior authorization requirement. [apologetically] Did your doctor's office mention anything about submitting that paperwork to your insurance?
508  [reassuringly] I know this is confusing, sometimes insurance companies change their requirements without much notice. [more briskly] Let me contact your doctor's office right now—can you hold for just a moment?
509  [professionally] Actually, wait—I'm seeing something else here. [quickly] The rejection code indicates you might have switched insurance plans recently, is that correct?
510  [knowingly] Ah, that explains it. [more rapidly] New insurance means new formulary rules, new ID numbers, everything starts fresh unfortunately. Do you have your new insurance card with you?
511  [patiently] Take your time, the member ID is usually the longest number on the card. [helpfully] Sometimes it starts with letters, then has about eight or nine digits after.
512  [typing sounds] [optimistically] Perfect, I'm entering this now. [more quickly] The system takes about thirty seconds to verify—oh, good news, it's going through!
513  [enthusiastically] The claim just approved! [rapidly] We can have it ready in about twenty minutes, or if you prefer, we offer free delivery tomorrow morning.
514  [warmly] You're very welcome, these insurance transitions can be really tricky. [quickly] Just bring your new insurance card when you come, we'll make a copy for future refills.
515  [Laugh] Oh my god, is that—is that actually me with the frosted tips? [Fast] I thought I destroyed all evidence of 2003!
516  [Whisper] Nobody can ever, and I mean ever, see this picture, okay? [Tsk] This stays between us.
517  [Slow] You know what, I'm just gonna... pretend this doesn't exist. [Sigh] Some things should stay buried.
518  [Happy] Wait, look at my face though—I was so confident! [Chuckle] Like, genuinely thought I looked amazing.
519  [Angry] Who even kept this? I specifically—ugh, I specifically asked everyone to delete these! [Groan]
520  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's just, um, display this masterpiece for everyone to admire. [Disappointed] Real nice of whoever saved it.
521  [Fast] Burn it, shred it, I don't care—just make it disappear before anyone else sees! [Shout] Now!
522  [Sad] I was trying so hard to fit in back then, y'know? [Slow] Kinda breaks my heart a little, honestly.
523  [Chuckle] The jean jacket with rhinestones was certainly, uh, certainly a choice. [Happy] Mom said I looked "hip"!
524  [Disappointed] And here I thought I'd successfully erased all proof of my emo phase. [Tsk] [Sigh] Guess not.
525  [Whisper] [Fast] Quick, quick, put it away—someone's coming and they cannot see me like that!
526  [Laugh] I'm literally—I can't even recognize myself under all that eyeliner! [Shout] What was I thinking?
527  [Slow] Actually, you know what? [Happy] At least I had the guts to try something different, right?
528  [Angry] [Fast] This is exactly why I don't trust anyone with photos anymore—they always come back to haunt you!
529  [Sarcastic] Yeah, because nothing says "peak fashion" like, um, like cargo shorts and a fedora. [Groan] Kill me now.
530  [Sad] [Whisper] I remember feeling so awkward that day—guess it really shows, huh?
531  [Chuckle] Okay but seriously, who let me leave the house looking like—like whatever that is? [Disappointed] My friends failed me.
532  [Happy] [Slow] You know what, I'm gonna frame this as a reminder of how far I've come.
533  [Fast] [Angry] Delete it from your phone, the cloud, everywhere—I mean it!
534  [Sigh] I guess we all have that one photo that just... [Laugh] [Slow] Yeah, let's never speak of this again.
535  [casual] Oh, so I sent Jake this text earlier about his new haircut. You know how he's been going on about it all week? I just wrote "congrats on joining the balding community, welcome brother" with like, crying laughing emojis. [conversational] I mean, it was obviously a joke, right? The dude got like a buzz cut, not— he's not actually going bald. And we always roast each other like that, it's our thing. [slight concern] But now I'm thinking about it and... [pause] he hasn't responded. Which is weird because he usually fires back immediately, you know? Like within minutes. [growing anxious] And I'm starting to wonder if maybe— oh god, what if he actually IS sensitive about his hair? What if there's like, a family history or something and I just— [worried] [nervous laugh] I mean, he would've told me, right? But what if that's exactly why he got the buzz cut? What if he's like, preemptively dealing with hair loss and I just basically called him out on his biggest insecurity? [spiraling] Oh no. Oh no no no. What if I completely misread our friendship dynamic? What if he thinks I'm just mean? [groan] What kind of person makes bald jokes? I'm— I'm probably the worst friend ever. [panicking] Ugh, should I send an apology text? But what if that makes it worse? What if—
536  Oh—okay, yeah, I did, but honestly it was such a good picture! You looked amazing in it, like genuinely. I thought you'd be happy about it.
537  I mean... yeah, I guess I didn't ask first, but come on, we post pics of each other all the time. Since when do we need permission for—[sigh] okay, fine, maybe I should've asked.
538  Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're acting like I posted something terrible. It was literally the most flattering photo I've ever taken of you. Everyone was commenting how great you looked!
539  Then what is the point? Because honestly, I'm kinda confused here. I thought I was doing something nice—showing off my friend, y'know? But you're treating me like I committed some huge [frustrated laugh] betrayal or something.
540  Okay okay, I hear you, but also—we were at a public event! There were gonna be photos anyway. And I'm not saying that makes it totally fine, but like... you're being a little intense about this, don't you think?
541  Yeah, actually, you are. I'm sorry I didn't text you first or whatever, but the way you're freezing me out right now is—it's not proportional. I made one mistake, if you even wanna call it that.
542  That's—that's not what I'm doing. [scoff] I'm just saying, a heads up would've been nice before you went full ice queen on me. Like "hey, please ask next time" instead of this whole... thing.
543  Basic—wow, okay. So now I'm what, some boundary-crossing monster? I literally thought you'd like it. I was trying to—ugh, forget it. You obviously just wanna be mad at me.
544  Fine. Fine, next time I'll ask. But honestly? You could've just said that instead of making me feel like the worst friend in the world for posting a nice photo.
545  Because I didn't know you were upset! You didn't say anything until now, and I'm not a mind reader. But y'know what—[groan] I'll take it down, okay? Happy?
546  [settling in, anticipatory] Okay, so, um, I've got my snacks, I've got my— my blanket, and I'm ready to, uh, to finally watch the next episode of— wait. [pause] Where is it? Where's, um, where's the show? [confused, muttering] I mean, it was literally right here yesterday, like, right in my "Continue Watching" thing. Let me just, uh— let me scroll down, maybe it's in, um, in my list somewhere? But that's— that's weird, right? [slightly annoyed] Oh, come on. [sigh] Did they— did they seriously remove it? Like, mid-season? Who does that? I was, uh, I was literally three episodes away from finishing and now it's just— [scoff] gone? [frustrated, talking faster] This is, um, this is exactly why I don't get attached to shows on streaming anymore. They just, like, they just yank them away when you're— when you're invested and— [groan] great. Cool. Perfect timing. [resigned, slightly sarcastic] Well, I guess I'm, uh, I'm finding a new show tonight. Or, I mean, I could always just, um, just stare at my ceiling. That's, uh— that's also an option. [exhale] Fantastic.
547  [muttering] Okay, so, um, keys. Where did I— where did I put my keys? I literally just had them, like, five minutes ago when I came in from the, uh, from the grocery store. [thinking out loud] Let me just— let me retrace this. I came through the door, I had the bags, and I, um, I definitely had my keys because I unlocked the— wait, did I put them down when I was dealing with all those bags? [sigh] That seems like something I would do. [slightly impatient] Kitchen counter. Let me just— no, not there. Um, coffee table? No. This is, uh, this is ridiculous, they can't just disappear into thin air, right? Unless I'm— unless I'm losing my mind, which, I mean, [nervous laugh] jury's still out on that one. [realization dawning] Oh wait wait wait. The grocery bags. I had, like, so many bags, and I was trying to— trying to juggle everything, and I think I maybe, um, maybe I set them down by the front door? [relieved but sheepish] Yep. There they are, just, uh, just sitting on the little table by the door. [exhale] Classic. I spend ten minutes searching and they're literally right where any normal person would put them. Great job, brain.
548  [muttering] Okay, so I just need to, um— I just need to get this stupid tag off. How hard can it be, right? It's just a little, uh, little plastic thing. [slightly annoyed] I mean, people did this for, like, centuries before scissors were invented, so there's gotta be— there's gotta be a way. Let me just, um, let me just try to pull it really hard and— [frustrated] Nope. Okay. [tsk] That's not— that's not working. It's just, uh, it's just making the string tighter, which is— which is the opposite of what I want here. [thoughtful] Wait, maybe if I, um, if I twist it? Like, twist the little plastic part and then— [grunt] no, that's not— ow, okay, that just hurt my fingers. [resigned but determined] Alright, alright. Let me think. What else is sharp around here? I could use, um, I could use my keys maybe? Or like a— a pen, or— [brightening] Oh! My teeth. I'll just, uh— [concentrated muttering] I'll just bite through this little— there we go. [satisfied] See? Problem solved. Sometimes you just gotta, um, you just gotta get creative.
549  [muttering to self] Okay, so she just said "expresso" again. Like, for the, um, for the third time in this conversation. It's— it's espresso, right? With an S? I mean, I'm pretty sure it's— yeah, it's definitely espresso. [slightly uncertain] But like, do I— do I say something? Because she seems really confident about it, and I don't want to be that person who's like, um, "actually..." [nervous laugh] God, I hate when people do that to me. [thinking out loud] Maybe she knows something I don't? No, that's— that's not right, it's definitely espresso. I've seen it written, like, a million times. But what if— what if she gets all embarrassed? Or what if she thinks I'm being, uh, being pretentious or whatever? [wavering] I mean, if it were me, I'd want someone to tell me, right? But then again, it's not— it's not that big of a deal. Like, everyone knows what she means. [resigned] You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm gonna let it go. Life's too short to be the pronunciation police. [exhale] Expresso it is.
550  [muttering] Wait, that's— that's not right. Fifteen ninety-nine? I could've sworn it was, um, it was like twelve something last time I was here. Or maybe— maybe it was thirteen? [tsk] I don't know, but it definitely wasn't, uh, wasn't almost sixteen dollars. [slightly incredulous] I mean, okay, so inflation, sure, but this is just— this is just pasta sauce. Like, it's not— it's not fancy pasta sauce, it's just the regular, um, the regular store brand stuff that I always get. How does it jump up three dollars in, what, like two months? [resigned sigh] Unless I'm, uh, unless I'm thinking of a different brand? No, no, that's definitely— that's definitely the one with the little, um, the little herb thing on the label. Same jar, same everything, just more— more expensive now, apparently. [contemplative] Maybe I should just, I don't know, maybe I should start making my own sauce? How hard can it be, right? It's just tomatoes and, uh, and garlic and stuff. But then I'd have to buy all the ingredients and— [deflated] [exhale] Yeah, okay, fine. Fifteen ninety-nine it is, I guess. At least I'm not, um, I'm not buying it every week or whatever.
551  [muttering] Okay, so, um, I've got darks and lights here, and I need to— I need to figure out what, uh, what setting this thing should be on. Normal wash? But what's, um, what's normal exactly? [slightly puzzled] I mean, these jeans are pretty dirty, but then I've got, like, this nice sweater that I don't want to— I don't want to destroy, you know? [hmm] Maybe I should just— maybe I should separate them, but that seems like a lot of— a lot of work for, uh, for a Tuesday. [reading aloud, uncertain] "Heavy duty, normal, delicate, quick wash"— okay, quick wash sounds good but is that gonna actually, um, actually clean anything? I feel like that's just, like, a rinse basically. [decisive, then second-guessing] Normal. I'm gonna go with normal because, uh, because that's what it's called, right? Normal. Although— [sigh] although maybe the sweater needs delicate? But then the jeans won't get— [resigned] You know what, normal it is. Everything's, um, everything's gonna be fine. Probably.
552  [muttering] Okay, so, um, there's gotta be something opening up soon, right? I mean, it's— it's almost eleven, people are probably, uh, people are probably leaving for lunch or whatever. I just need, like, one spot. One spot. [slightly impatient] That guy's been sitting in his car for, what, like five minutes now? Come on, dude. Either leave or— or don't, but just, um, just make a decision, you know? [sigh] Maybe he's on a phone call or something. I shouldn't— I shouldn't judge. [hopeful] Oh wait, wait wait. That woman with the, uh, with the shopping bags. She's walking toward— no, nope, she's just... she's just walking past all the cars. Great. Cool. [exhale] False alarm. [resigned but chatty] I could just, um, I could just park in the garage, but that's like eight bucks and it's— it's literally right there, you know? The free spots are right there, I just need to, uh, need to be patient. Which I'm... which I'm definitely not good at, but— [brightening] Okay, backup lights! Finally. Thank you, universe. We're, uh, we're back in business.
553  [muttering] Okay, so, um, stairs or elevator. Third floor. That's not— that's not that bad, right? I mean, it's only three flights, but I'm wearing these, uh, these new shoes and they're kind of— [sigh] they're kind of tight. [slightly winded from thinking about it] But the elevator's probably gonna take forever. It always does. And there's gonna be, like, five other people crammed in there, all breathing and, um, and pressing buttons for every single floor. Which is— I mean, that's fine, but— [more decisive] You know what? Stairs. I should take the stairs. That's, uh, that's exercise, right? I keep saying I need to move more, and this is— this is moving. Three flights. I can do three flights. [second-guessing] Although, um, I am carrying this bag, and it's pretty heavy with all my— wait, do I even need all this stuff? I probably don't need— [tsk] okay, focus. Stairs or elevator. [resigned but practical] Elevator. I'm taking the elevator. My feet hurt, the bag's heavy, and I'm, uh, I'm not trying to be a hero here. [exhale] Sometimes the lazy choice is just the smart choice.
554  [casual] So I, um, I met this new guy at work today— his name's, uh, his name's Art. And I was like, "Oh, like, uh, like short for Arthur?" And he goes, "No, just Art." So I'm like, um, "Well that's perfect, you can just, uh, hang around on walls all day!" [light laugh] [conversational] You know, like— like a dad joke, but I thought it was, um, I thought it was pretty good. Classic, uh, classic name humor, right? [trailing off] But then he just, um... he just kind of, uh, gave me this look? Like this really— this really tired look, and he was like, "Yeah, um, yeah I've never heard that one before." [realizing] And I'm thinking about it now and, uh, and I'm like— oh god. Oh no. He's probably— I mean, his name is literally Art, so he's probably heard every single, um, every single art joke in existence, right? [building guilt] Like, uh, "Are you a masterpiece?" "Do you belong in a museum?" All that— [groan] all that stupid stuff that people probably say to him every, um, every single day of his life! [spiraling] [frustrated sigh] I'm such an idiot! I thought I was being, um, being clever and original, but I'm just— I'm just another person making the same, uh, the same terrible pun that he's heard a million times! Poor guy probably cringes every time he, um, every time he introduces himself! [groaning] God, I'm the worst!
555  [casual] So you know how my car's been, um, making those little beeping sounds? Like, uh, the maintenance reminders? I've been just— I've been hitting dismiss for, like, weeks now. [light laugh] I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll get to it, you know? It's, um, it's probably just the oil or whatever. [conversational] I mean, cars are dramatic, right? They act like everything's, uh, like everything's an emergency. "Service engine soon"— soon could be, like, next month, you know what I mean? So I've just been— I've been ignoring it and, um, and everything's been fine, so— [slight concern] But then today I'm driving to work and there's this, uh, this grinding sound. Like a, um— like metal on metal? Which is— that's not, uh, that's not the usual beeping, you know? It's more like— [makes grinding noise] —that kind of thing, and I'm thinking, okay, maybe I should, um, maybe I should actually— [realization dawning] Wait. Wait, no. Oh god. The, uh, the brake maintenance thing. That was— that was one of the reminders, wasn't it? [nervous laugh] The one I kept, um, kept dismissing because it seemed like— oh no, oh no, oh no. [growing panic] That grinding— that's my brake pads, isn't it? Like, completely, um, completely gone? I've been driving around with no— with basically no brakes for— [sharp exhale] how long have I been ignoring that thing? Weeks? Oh my god, what if I— what if I can't stop? What if they're completely— [spiraling dread] I could have killed someone! I could have— the, uh, the school zone I drive through every morning, all those kids— [whimper] and I was just, um, I was just hitting dismiss like it was nothing! Like it was spam! Oh god, oh god, I'm— I'm the worst person alive. What have I done?
556  [casual] So I had this whole thing with Marcus today. You know how he's been, like, super micromanaging lately? I was just so fed up with it. [conversational] I needed to vent, you know? So I fired off this message to what I thought was our usual group chat — just you, me, and Sarah. I was like, "Marcus is being such a control freak, I can't even breathe without him questioning my decisions." [a bit annoyed] And I really went off, you know? I said he treats everyone like we're incompetent, that his constant hovering is making the whole team miserable. [exhales] I felt better after getting it all out. [matter-of-fact] But then I'm sitting here now, and I realized I should probably delete it before someone screenshots it or whatever, so I go back to check the chat and— [stopping short] Wait. [pause] Oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no. [growing panic] It wasn't our group chat. It was the PROJECT group chat. The one with— [sharp exhale] Marcus is IN that chat. He's been in that chat this whole time! [spiraling] [nervous laugh] He saw everything! Every word! "Control freak," "micromanaging," all of it! [whimper] And there's three read receipts! Oh my god, I want to disappear into the floor right now!
557  [irritated] Okay so you know how Jason said he'd help me move this weekend? Well guess what— he just texted me like an hour ago saying he can't make it. An hour ago! I've had the U-Haul booked for like two weeks. [frustrated] And this is so typical of him, like, he does this all the time. Remember my birthday dinner? He bailed last minute for that too. Said he was "feeling off" or whatever, and then I see him posting stories at some bar later that night. [annoyed] [building up] I'm just— I'm so tired of making plans with people who don't, who don't actually show up, you know? Like why even say yes if you're just gonna flake? Now I have to figure out how to move a couch by myself, which is like— [scoff] that's impossible. [surprised] Oh wait, he's— he's calling me right now. Should I even— okay fine, let me just... [quieter] [concerned] Oh. Oh wow. Um... so apparently his dad had a heart attack yesterday and he's at the hospital right now. He's been there all night and he just— [sigh] he didn't want to bother anyone with it. [guilty] [soft] God, I feel like such an ass. Here I am complaining about a couch when his dad is in the ICU. I should probably, like, bring him coffee or something instead of being mad about— yeah. Priorities.
558  [irritated] So I texted Jake this morning about the apartment thing, right? Like a pretty important question about whether he wants to renew the lease or if we should start looking for something new. [annoyed] And it's been like eight hours. Eight hours! I can see he's been online, he's been posting stories, but somehow my text about our actual living situation is just— [scoff] I don't know, not worth responding to I guess. [frustrated] I'm just sitting here like, okay cool, I'll just put my whole life on hold while you decide if you want to be an adult about this. Because the landlord needs an answer by Friday and it's already Tuesday and I'm— ugh, I hate when people do this. [building anger] Like how hard is it to just— it's a yes or no question, you know? Do you want to stay or do you want to— [surprised] Oh wait, he's... he's calling me right now actually. Hold on— [pause] Hello? [shocked] [excited] Oh my god. Oh my GOD. He— okay so apparently he was at the doctor all day getting test results and he didn't want to text me back until he knew for sure but— [thrilled] He got into grad school! The program he's been wanting forever! He was just— he was scared to jinx it by talking about anything else first. [laugh] I'm such an idiot.
559  [frustrated] [bitter] Oh my god, I felt like such an idiot tonight. Like, I spent two hours getting ready for Emma's party — I'm talking full makeup, that dress I bought last month, the whole thing — and I show up and everyone's in like jeans and t-shirts. Everyone. [embarrassed] [annoyed] And Emma's just like "oh wow, you look so fancy!" but in that way where it's like, clearly I misread the vibe completely. I'm standing there feeling like I'm at the wrong party or something. [groan] I should have just gone home and changed. [deflated] I was gonna leave early, honestly. I was like plotting my escape, figuring out how long I had to stay before it wouldn't be rude to just— you know, Irish goodbye situation. [surprised] Oh wait, hold on, someone's texting me... it's Jake from the party. [reading] He says— oh. He says I looked amazing tonight and he was too shy to say anything? And like three other people are texting me too, saying— [brightening] [slightly amazed] Wait, Sarah's asking where I got my dress because she wants to get one. And Marcus is saying I looked "absolutely stunning" — that's, that's a direct quote. [warm] [laughing] Oh my god, maybe I wasn't the overdressed disaster I thought I was. [chuckle] Maybe I was just... the best dressed person there?
560  [casual] So I had this thing with my brother earlier. Nothing major, just— you know how he is about the car. I asked to borrow it for like two hours and he got all weird about it. [a bit annoyed] And I'm like, dude, I just need to get to the store and back, it's not a big deal. But he starts going on about how I never ask in advance and how it's inconsiderate or whatever. [more frustrated] So then I'm like, fine, forget it, I'll figure something else out. But he keeps going, right? Like he won't drop it. And I just— [exhales] I got fed up. [matter-of-fact] I told him he was being selfish and that maybe if he wasn't such a control freak about everything, people would actually want to be around him. [pause] You know, just to shut him up. [stopping short] But saying it now... [nervous laugh] God, that sounds really— that's actually pretty harsh, isn't it? [realizing] [building anxiety] Oh no. Oh my god, I actually said that to him. "People would actually want to be around him"? What is wrong with me? He's been having such a hard time making friends at his new school and I just— [spiraling] [voice cracking] [whimper] I'm the worst sister ever. I'm literally the worst person. He probably thinks I hate him now.
561  [excited] Oh my God, okay, so you know how I've been wanting to do something creative again? Well I finally decided to start that podcast I was talking about! The one about, um, about weird local history stuff? I spent like three hours last night just brainstorming and I have so many good ideas. [enthusiastic] Like there's this whole thing about the underground tunnels downtown that nobody talks about, and then there's that haunted theater, and oh— the story about why they moved the cemetery in the 1800s? People don't know about any of this stuff, it's gonna be amazing. [overwhelmed] [slightly panicked] But then I started actually looking into it and Jesus, there's so much— like I need to research everything properly, and then there's all the technical stuff with recording and editing, and apparently I need like special microphones and software and— God, I don't know the first thing about audio editing. And I was gonna interview people but that means I have to like, reach out and schedule and... [pause, thinking] Wait. Wait, actually— why am I making this so complicated? [lighter] [relieved] I could just start simple, right? Like, just me talking about one story at a time. No fancy equipment, just my phone. I mean, everyone starts somewhere, and I'm acting like I need to launch some professional production right out the gate. [chuckling] [more confident] Yeah, okay. One story, one recording. I can figure out the rest later.
