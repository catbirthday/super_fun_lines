Character 1: You posted that photo of me.

536 Character 2: Oh—okay, yeah, I did, but honestly it was such a good picture! You looked amazing in it, like genuinely. I thought you'd be happy about it.

Character 1: Without asking.

537 Character 2: I mean... yeah, I guess I didn't ask first, but come on, we post pics of each other all the time. Since when do we need permission for—[sigh] okay, fine, maybe I should've asked.

Character 1: Maybe?

538 Character 2: Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're acting like I posted something terrible. It was literally the most flattering photo I've ever taken of you. Everyone was commenting how great you looked!

Character 1: That's not the point.

539 Character 2: Then what is the point? Because honestly, I'm kinda confused here. I thought I was doing something nice—showing off my friend, y'know? But you're treating me like I committed some huge [frustrated laugh] betrayal or something.

Character 1: It's my face. My choice.

540 Character 2: Okay okay, I hear you, but also—we were at a public event! There were gonna be photos anyway. And I'm not saying that makes it totally fine, but like... you're being a little intense about this, don't you think?

Character 1: Am I?

541 Character 2: Yeah, actually, you are. I'm sorry I didn't text you first or whatever, but the way you're freezing me out right now is—it's not proportional. I made one mistake, if you even wanna call it that.

Character 1: You don't get to decide what bothers me.

542 Character 2: That's—that's not what I'm doing. [scoff] I'm just saying, a heads up would've been nice before you went full ice queen on me. Like "hey, please ask next time" instead of this whole... thing.

Character 1: I shouldn't have to explain basic boundaries.

543 Character 2: Basic—wow, okay. So now I'm what, some boundary-crossing monster? I literally thought you'd like it. I was trying to—ugh, forget it. You obviously just wanna be mad at me.

Character 1: I wanted you to ask first. That's it.

544 Character 2: Fine. Fine, next time I'll ask. But honestly? You could've just said that instead of making me feel like the worst friend in the world for posting a nice photo.

Character 1: It's been up for three hours.

545 Character 2: Because I didn't know you were upset! You didn't say anything until now, and I'm not a mind reader. But y'know what—[groan] I'll take it down, okay? Happy?

546 SCENARIO: discovering the show they wanted to watch was removed from streaming

==================================================

[settling in, anticipatory]

Okay, so, um, I've got my snacks, I've got my— my blanket, and I'm ready to, uh, to finally watch the next episode of— wait. [pause] Where is it? Where's, um, where's the show?

[confused, muttering]

I mean, it was literally right here yesterday, like, right in my "Continue Watching" thing. Let me just, uh— let me scroll down, maybe it's in, um, in my list somewhere? But that's— that's weird, right?

[slightly annoyed]

Oh, come on. [sigh] Did they— did they seriously remove it? Like, mid-season? Who does that? I was, uh, I was literally three episodes away from finishing and now it's just— [scoff] gone?

[frustrated, talking faster]

This is, um, this is exactly why I don't get attached to shows on streaming anymore. They just, like, they just yank them away when you're— when you're invested and— [groan] great. Cool. Perfect timing.

[resigned, slightly sarcastic]

Well, I guess I'm, uh, I'm finding a new show tonight. Or, I mean, I could always just, um, just stare at my ceiling. That's, uh— that's also an option. [exhale] Fantastic.

547 SCENARIO: trying to remember where they put their keys

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, keys. Where did I— where did I put my keys? I literally just had them, like, five minutes ago when I came in from the, uh, from the grocery store.

[thinking out loud]

Let me just— let me retrace this. I came through the door, I had the bags, and I, um, I definitely had my keys because I unlocked the— wait, did I put them down when I was dealing with all those bags? [sigh] That seems like something I would do.

[slightly impatient]

Kitchen counter. Let me just— no, not there. Um, coffee table? No. This is, uh, this is ridiculous, they can't just disappear into thin air, right? Unless I'm— unless I'm losing my mind, which, I mean, [nervous laugh] jury's still out on that one.

[realization dawning]

Oh wait wait wait. The grocery bags. I had, like, so many bags, and I was trying to— trying to juggle everything, and I think I maybe, um, maybe I set them down by the front door?

[relieved but sheepish]

Yep. There they are, just, uh, just sitting on the little table by the door. [exhale] Classic. I spend ten minutes searching and they're literally right where any normal person would put them. Great job, brain.

548 SCENARIO: attempting to remove a tag without scissors

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I just need to, um— I just need to get this stupid tag off. How hard can it be, right? It's just a little, uh, little plastic thing.

[slightly annoyed]

I mean, people did this for, like, centuries before scissors were invented, so there's gotta be— there's gotta be a way. Let me just, um, let me just try to pull it really hard and—

[frustrated]

Nope. Okay. [tsk] That's not— that's not working. It's just, uh, it's just making the string tighter, which is— which is the opposite of what I want here.

[thoughtful]

Wait, maybe if I, um, if I twist it? Like, twist the little plastic part and then— [grunt] no, that's not— ow, okay, that just hurt my fingers.

[resigned but determined]

Alright, alright. Let me think. What else is sharp around here? I could use, um, I could use my keys maybe? Or like a— a pen, or—

[brightening]

Oh! My teeth. I'll just, uh— [concentrated muttering] I'll just bite through this little— there we go. [satisfied] See? Problem solved. Sometimes you just gotta, um, you just gotta get creative.

549 SCENARIO: debating whether to correct someone's pronunciation

==================================================

[muttering to self]

Okay, so she just said "expresso" again. Like, for the, um, for the third time in this conversation. It's— it's espresso, right? With an S? I mean, I'm pretty sure it's— yeah, it's definitely espresso.

[slightly uncertain]

But like, do I— do I say something? Because she seems really confident about it, and I don't want to be that person who's like, um, "actually..." [nervous laugh] God, I hate when people do that to me.

[thinking out loud]

Maybe she knows something I don't? No, that's— that's not right, it's definitely espresso. I've seen it written, like, a million times. But what if— what if she gets all embarrassed? Or what if she thinks I'm being, uh, being pretentious or whatever?

[wavering]

I mean, if it were me, I'd want someone to tell me, right? But then again, it's not— it's not that big of a deal. Like, everyone knows what she means.

[resigned]

You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm gonna let it go. Life's too short to be the pronunciation police. [exhale] Expresso it is.

550 SCENARIO: noticing the price went up since last time

==================================================

[muttering]

Wait, that's— that's not right. Fifteen ninety-nine? I could've sworn it was, um, it was like twelve something last time I was here. Or maybe— maybe it was thirteen? [tsk] I don't know, but it definitely wasn't, uh, wasn't almost sixteen dollars.

[slightly incredulous]

I mean, okay, so inflation, sure, but this is just— this is just pasta sauce. Like, it's not— it's not fancy pasta sauce, it's just the regular, um, the regular store brand stuff that I always get. How does it jump up three dollars in, what, like two months?

[resigned sigh]

Unless I'm, uh, unless I'm thinking of a different brand? No, no, that's definitely— that's definitely the one with the little, um, the little herb thing on the label. Same jar, same everything, just more— more expensive now, apparently.

[contemplative]

Maybe I should just, I don't know, maybe I should start making my own sauce? How hard can it be, right? It's just tomatoes and, uh, and garlic and stuff. But then I'd have to buy all the ingredients and—

[deflated]

[exhale] Yeah, okay, fine. Fifteen ninety-nine it is, I guess. At least I'm not, um, I'm not buying it every week or whatever.

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, I've got darks and lights here, and I need to— I need to figure out what, uh, what setting this thing should be on. Normal wash? But what's, um, what's normal exactly?

[slightly puzzled]

I mean, these jeans are pretty dirty, but then I've got, like, this nice sweater that I don't want to— I don't want to destroy, you know? [hmm] Maybe I should just— maybe I should separate them, but that seems like a lot of— a lot of work for, uh, for a Tuesday.

[reading aloud, uncertain]

"Heavy duty, normal, delicate, quick wash"— okay, quick wash sounds good but is that gonna actually, um, actually clean anything? I feel like that's just, like, a rinse basically.

[decisive, then second-guessing]

Normal. I'm gonna go with normal because, uh, because that's what it's called, right? Normal. Although— [sigh] although maybe the sweater needs delicate? But then the jeans won't get—

[resigned]

You know what, normal it is. Everything's, um, everything's gonna be fine. Probably.

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, there's gotta be something opening up soon, right? I mean, it's— it's almost eleven, people are probably, uh, people are probably leaving for lunch or whatever. I just need, like, one spot. One spot.

[slightly impatient]

That guy's been sitting in his car for, what, like five minutes now? Come on, dude. Either leave or— or don't, but just, um, just make a decision, you know? [sigh] Maybe he's on a phone call or something. I shouldn't— I shouldn't judge.

[hopeful]

Oh wait, wait wait. That woman with the, uh, with the shopping bags. She's walking toward— no, nope, she's just... she's just walking past all the cars. Great. Cool. [exhale] False alarm.

[resigned but chatty]

I could just, um, I could just park in the garage, but that's like eight bucks and it's— it's literally right there, you know? The free spots are right there, I just need to, uh, need to be patient. Which I'm... which I'm definitely not good at, but—

[brightening]

Okay, backup lights! Finally. Thank you, universe. We're, uh, we're back in business.

553 SCENARIO: debating whether to take the stairs or elevator

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, stairs or elevator. Third floor. That's not— that's not that bad, right? I mean, it's only three flights, but I'm wearing these, uh, these new shoes and they're kind of— [sigh] they're kind of tight.

[slightly winded from thinking about it]

But the elevator's probably gonna take forever. It always does. And there's gonna be, like, five other people crammed in there, all breathing and, um, and pressing buttons for every single floor. Which is— I mean, that's fine, but—

[more decisive]

You know what? Stairs. I should take the stairs. That's, uh, that's exercise, right? I keep saying I need to move more, and this is— this is moving. Three flights. I can do three flights.

[second-guessing]

Although, um, I am carrying this bag, and it's pretty heavy with all my— wait, do I even need all this stuff? I probably don't need— [tsk] okay, focus. Stairs or elevator.

[resigned but practical]

Elevator. I'm taking the elevator. My feet hurt, the bag's heavy, and I'm, uh, I'm not trying to be a hero here. [exhale] Sometimes the lazy choice is just the smart choice.

==================================================

[casual]

So I, um, I met this new guy at work today— his name's, uh, his name's Art. And I was like, "Oh, like, uh, like short for Arthur?" And he goes, "No, just Art." So I'm like, um, "Well that's perfect, you can just, uh, hang around on walls all day!" [light laugh]

[conversational]

You know, like— like a dad joke, but I thought it was, um, I thought it was pretty good. Classic, uh, classic name humor, right?

[trailing off]

But then he just, um... he just kind of, uh, gave me this look? Like this really— this really tired look, and he was like, "Yeah, um, yeah I've never heard that one before."

[realizing]

And I'm thinking about it now and, uh, and I'm like— oh god. Oh no. He's probably— I mean, his name is literally Art, so he's probably heard every single, um, every single art joke in existence, right?

[building guilt]

Like, uh, "Are you a masterpiece?" "Do you belong in a museum?" All that— [groan] all that stupid stuff that people probably say to him every, um, every single day of his life!

[spiraling]

[frustrated sigh] I'm such an idiot! I thought I was being, um, being clever and original, but I'm just— I'm just another person making the same, uh, the same terrible pun that he's heard a million times! Poor guy probably cringes every time he, um, every time he introduces himself! [groaning] God, I'm the worst!

555 SCENARIO: Lightly joking about ignoring maintenance reminders, then hearing a sound, then connecting the sound to the ignored maintenance, ending in consequence-of-negligence dread

==================================================

[casual]

So you know how my car's been, um, making those little beeping sounds? Like, uh, the maintenance reminders? I've been just— I've been hitting dismiss for, like, weeks now. [light laugh] I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'll get to it, you know? It's, um, it's probably just the oil or whatever.

[conversational]

I mean, cars are dramatic, right? They act like everything's, uh, like everything's an emergency. "Service engine soon"— soon could be, like, next month, you know what I mean? So I've just been— I've been ignoring it and, um, and everything's been fine, so—

[slight concern]

But then today I'm driving to work and there's this, uh, this grinding sound. Like a, um— like metal on metal? Which is— that's not, uh, that's not the usual beeping, you know? It's more like— [makes grinding noise] —that kind of thing, and I'm thinking, okay, maybe I should, um, maybe I should actually—

[realization dawning]

Wait. Wait, no. Oh god. The, uh, the brake maintenance thing. That was— that was one of the reminders, wasn't it? [nervous laugh] The one I kept, um, kept dismissing because it seemed like— oh no, oh no, oh no.

[growing panic]

That grinding— that's my brake pads, isn't it? Like, completely, um, completely gone? I've been driving around with no— with basically no brakes for— [sharp exhale] how long have I been ignoring that thing? Weeks? Oh my god, what if I— what if I can't stop? What if they're completely—

[spiraling dread]

I could have killed someone! I could have— the, uh, the school zone I drive through every morning, all those kids— [whimper] and I was just, um, I was just hitting dismiss like it was nothing! Like it was spam! Oh god, oh god, I'm— I'm the worst person alive. What have I done?

556 SCENARIO: Casually describing a complaint they vented in what they thought was a private chat, then checking, then realizing it was a group chat with the person they complained about, ending in social horror

==================================================

[casual]

So I had this whole thing with Marcus today. You know how he's been, like, super micromanaging lately? I was just so fed up with it.

[conversational]

I needed to vent, you know? So I fired off this message to what I thought was our usual group chat — just you, me, and Sarah. I was like, "Marcus is being such a control freak, I can't even breathe without him questioning my decisions."

[a bit annoyed]

And I really went off, you know? I said he treats everyone like we're incompetent, that his constant hovering is making the whole team miserable. [exhales] I felt better after getting it all out.

[matter-of-fact]

But then I'm sitting here now, and I realized I should probably delete it before someone screenshots it or whatever, so I go back to check the chat and—

[stopping short]

Wait. [pause] Oh no. Oh no, oh no, oh no.

[growing panic]

It wasn't our group chat. It was the PROJECT group chat. The one with— [sharp exhale] Marcus is IN that chat. He's been in that chat this whole time!

[spiraling] [nervous laugh]

He saw everything! Every word! "Control freak," "micromanaging," all of it! [whimper] And there's three read receipts! Oh my god, I want to disappear into the floor right now!

==================================================

[irritated]

Okay so you know how Jason said he'd help me move this weekend? Well guess what— he just texted me like an hour ago saying he can't make it. An hour ago! I've had the U-Haul booked for like two weeks.

[frustrated]

And this is so typical of him, like, he does this all the time. Remember my birthday dinner? He bailed last minute for that too. Said he was "feeling off" or whatever, and then I see him posting stories at some bar later that night.

[annoyed] [building up]

I'm just— I'm so tired of making plans with people who don't, who don't actually show up, you know? Like why even say yes if you're just gonna flake? Now I have to figure out how to move a couch by myself, which is like— [scoff] that's impossible.

[surprised]

Oh wait, he's— he's calling me right now. Should I even— okay fine, let me just...

[quieter] [concerned]

Oh. Oh wow. Um... so apparently his dad had a heart attack yesterday and he's at the hospital right now. He's been there all night and he just— [sigh] he didn't want to bother anyone with it.

[guilty] [soft]

God, I feel like such an ass. Here I am complaining about a couch when his dad is in the ICU. I should probably, like, bring him coffee or something instead of being mad about— yeah. Priorities.

==================================================

[irritated]

So I texted Jake this morning about the apartment thing, right? Like a pretty important question about whether he wants to renew the lease or if we should start looking for something new.

[annoyed]

And it's been like eight hours. Eight hours! I can see he's been online, he's been posting stories, but somehow my text about our actual living situation is just— [scoff] I don't know, not worth responding to I guess.

[frustrated]

I'm just sitting here like, okay cool, I'll just put my whole life on hold while you decide if you want to be an adult about this. Because the landlord needs an answer by Friday and it's already Tuesday and I'm— ugh, I hate when people do this.

[building anger]

Like how hard is it to just— it's a yes or no question, you know? Do you want to stay or do you want to— 

[surprised]

Oh wait, he's... he's calling me right now actually. Hold on— [pause] Hello?

[shocked] [excited]

Oh my god. Oh my GOD. He— okay so apparently he was at the doctor all day getting test results and he didn't want to text me back until he knew for sure but— 

[thrilled]

He got into grad school! The program he's been wanting forever! He was just— he was scared to jinx it by talking about anything else first. [laugh] I'm such an idiot.

Oh my god, I felt like such an idiot tonight. Like, I spent two hours getting ready for Emma's party — I'm talking full makeup, that dress I bought last month, the whole thing — and I show up and everyone's in like jeans and t-shirts. Everyone.

[embarrassed] [annoyed]

And Emma's just like "oh wow, you look so fancy!" but in that way where it's like, clearly I misread the vibe completely. I'm standing there feeling like I'm at the wrong party or something. [groan] I should have just gone home and changed.

[deflated]

I was gonna leave early, honestly. I was like plotting my escape, figuring out how long I had to stay before it wouldn't be rude to just— you know, Irish goodbye situation.

[surprised]

Oh wait, hold on, someone's texting me... it's Jake from the party. 

[reading]

He says— oh. He says I looked amazing tonight and he was too shy to say anything? And like three other people are texting me too, saying— 

[brightening] [slightly amazed]

Wait, Sarah's asking where I got my dress because she wants to get one. And Marcus is saying I looked "absolutely stunning" — that's, that's a direct quote.

==================================================

[casual]

So I had this thing with my brother earlier. Nothing major, just— you know how he is about the car. I asked to borrow it for like two hours and he got all weird about it.

[a bit annoyed]

And I'm like, dude, I just need to get to the store and back, it's not a big deal. But he starts going on about how I never ask in advance and how it's inconsiderate or whatever.

[more frustrated]

So then I'm like, fine, forget it, I'll figure something else out. But he keeps going, right? Like he won't drop it. And I just— [exhales] I got fed up.

[matter-of-fact]

I told him he was being selfish and that maybe if he wasn't such a control freak about everything, people would actually want to be around him. [pause] You know, just to shut him up.

[stopping short]

But saying it now... [nervous laugh] God, that sounds really— that's actually pretty harsh, isn't it?

[realizing] [building anxiety]

Oh no. Oh my god, I actually said that to him. "People would actually want to be around him"? What is wrong with me? He's been having such a hard time making friends at his new school and I just—

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my God, okay, so you know how I've been wanting to do something creative again? Well I finally decided to start that podcast I was talking about! The one about, um, about weird local history stuff? I spent like three hours last night just brainstorming and I have so many good ideas.

[enthusiastic]

Like there's this whole thing about the underground tunnels downtown that nobody talks about, and then there's that haunted theater, and oh— the story about why they moved the cemetery in the 1800s? People don't know about any of this stuff, it's gonna be amazing.

[overwhelmed] [slightly panicked]

But then I started actually looking into it and Jesus, there's so much— like I need to research everything properly, and then there's all the technical stuff with recording and editing, and apparently I need like special microphones and software and—

God, I don't know the first thing about audio editing. And I was gonna interview people but that means I have to like, reach out and schedule and...

[pause, thinking]

Wait. Wait, actually— why am I making this so complicated?

[lighter] [relieved]

I could just start simple, right? Like, just me talking about one story at a time. No fancy equipment, just my phone. I mean, everyone starts somewhere, and I'm acting like I need to launch some professional production right out the gate.

[chuckling] [more confident]

Yeah, okay. One story, one recording. I can figure out the rest later.
