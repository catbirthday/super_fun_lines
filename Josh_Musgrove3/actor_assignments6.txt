Character 1: I finished it.

412 Character 2: Wait wait wait—finished what? Oh my god, is this about the—the thing you've been working on?

Character 1: The novel. Yeah.

413 Character 2: Holy—okay, I'm literally gonna cry right now. You actually did it? Like, the whole thing? Beginning, middle, end, all of it?

Character 1: Three hundred and twelve pages.

414 Character 2: Three hundred and— [Gasp] that's like, that's a real book! An actual real book that you wrote with your own brain and everything!

Character 1: It's just a first draft.

415 Character 2: No no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you minimize it, okay? This is huge. Like, do you know how many people say they're gonna write a novel and then just... don't?

Character 1: Most of them, probably.

416 Character 2: Exactly! And you're not—you're not one of them anymore. You're like, officially a novelist now. How does it feel? Are you, I dunno, relieved? Excited?

Character 1: Tired, mostly.

417 Character 2: Oh babe, I bet. When did you—actually wait, when did you even finish? Was it last night? Is that why you look kinda [Chuckle] zombie-ish today?

Character 1: Three AM. Couldn't sleep after.

418 Character 2: Three in the—okay that's so dramatic and perfect though, right? Like, finishing your first novel in the middle of the night? That's literally how it happens in movies!

Character 1: Now I have to edit it.

419 Character 2: Well yeah, but—but that's tomorrow's problem, y'know? Today you just gotta, like, let yourself actually feel proud of this. Have you told anyone else yet?

Character 1: Just you.

420 Character 2: Just—oh. [Softer] Oh wow, okay, that's... I'm really honored actually. Like really, really honored. Can I—would it be weird if I asked what it's about?

Character 1: It's complicated. Family stuff. Ghosts, but not really ghosts.

421 Character 2: Not really ghosts? That sounds—honestly that sounds exactly like something you'd write. Mysterious and kinda dark but probably, like, secretly really emotional underneath, right?

422 SCENARIO: attempting to fold a fitted sheet

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, how hard can this be, right? It's just a— it's just a sheet. I mean, people do this all the time, it's not like, uh, it's not like rocket science or whatever.

[slightly uncertain]

So I've got the, um, the corners here, and I think— I think you're supposed to put the corners together? Like, corner to corner, and then, uh— [sigh] wait, which corners though?

[getting frustrated]

Okay, no, that's not— that's not right. Now it's all bunched up and weird and it looks like a, um, like a fabric burrito or something. [nervous laugh] This is, uh, this is not how fitted sheets are supposed to look.

[determined]

Let me just— let me start over. There's gotta be a system here, right? Like, elastic corner goes with elastic corner, and then you, um, you fold it in half, and then—

[deflated]

[groan] It's doing that weird inside-out thing again. You know what? You know what, maybe this is just— maybe this is just how fitted sheets live now. In a, uh, in a vaguely rectangular blob shape.

[resigned but amused]

I'm just gonna shove it in the closet and pretend it's, um, pretend it's folded. Close enough, right? [weak laugh] Martha Stewart would probably cry, but, uh, Martha Stewart's not doing my laundry, so...

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 22571582 | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [nervously] I'm actually trying to be good tonight. [quieter] Just a salad for me, please. [Deep breath] My doctor says I need to watch my cholesterol, and I've already lost five pounds this month.

423 Character 2: [dismissively] Oh come on, one night won't kill you! [enthusiastic] I'm ordering the cheese platter, garlic bread, and [getting louder] that incredible chocolate lava cake. [Snort] Life's too short to eat rabbit food.

Character 1: [firmly] That sounds amazing, but I'm sticking to my plan. [softer] Maybe just some grilled chicken with the salad? [Nervous laugh] I've been doing so well lately, I don't want to slip up now.

424 Character 2: [wheedling tone] But it's Friday! [faster] We always share the spinach artichoke dip on Fridays, remember? [Dramatic sigh] Plus, I can't eat all that bread alone—[pleading] you're making me look like a glutton here!

Character 1: [Uncomfortable chuckle] You're not a glutton. [more defensive] I just need to stay focused on my goals right now. [wavering] Maybe I could have one piece of bread? [quickly] No, no, I shouldn't even start.

425 Character 2: [sarcastically sweet] One piece of bread, how rebellious. [Scoff] Remember when we used to demolish entire pizzas together? [wistful] Those were the days. [sharper] Now you're all kale smoothies and counting almonds.

Character 1: [hurt] It's not like that. [steadier] I'm trying to be healthier, not punish myself. [Soft exhale] My energy levels are better, I sleep better—[brightening slightly] I even ran a 5K last weekend without stopping!

426 Character 2: [grudgingly impressed] Okay, that's actually pretty cool. [Pause] [more enthusiastic] But you're celebrating tonight, right? [coaxing] Winners deserve victory meals! [Giggle] Come on, split the pasta special with me—it's practically a marathon medal!

Character 1: [laughing] That's not how nutrition works! [more serious] Look, I appreciate you wanting to include me. [gentle] Why don't you get what you want, and [hopeful voice] I'll steal a bite of your dessert later?

427 Character 2: [triumphant] Aha! So you DO want dessert! [teasing] The diet fortress has a crack! [Cackle] I'm ordering two spoons for that lava cake. [smugly] Your willpower never stands a chance against melted chocolate.

Character 1: [exasperated] One bite doesn't mean I'm abandoning everything. [calmer] It's about balance, not deprivation. [Thoughtful hum] Actually, having a taste might stop me from binging later when I'm home alone with my cravings.

428 Character 2: [skeptical] Right, because one bite always stays one bite. [knowing tone] Remember the "one chip" incident at Sandra's party? [Loud laugh] You ate the entire bowl! [affectionately] Just admit you miss our food adventures together.

Character 1: [quietly] Of course I miss them. [more emotional] I miss not thinking about every calorie too. [Shaky breath] But I also missed fitting into my clothes and [stronger] feeling confident at the beach last summer.

429 Character 2: [softening] Hey, I didn't mean to make this heavy. [apologetic] You looked great then, you look great now. [Gentle sigh] I just—[trailing off] I guess I feel like we don't connect the same way anymore.

Character 1: [surprised] What? [warmly] Food isn't our only connection! [reassuring] We're here together, aren't we? [Chuckle] Besides, I can still appreciate your food stories—[playful] I just experience them vicariously through you now!

430 Character 2: [brightening] That's true! [excited again] Speaking of stories, wait till you hear about the sushi place I found. [mysteriously] They do this thing with torched salmon—[dreamily] it's basically butter that swims.

Character 1: [amused] See? This is perfect! [cheerful] You eat, you describe every flavor in detail. [Giggle] I'll live through your taste buds while [contentedly] enjoying my grilled chicken, which honestly sounds pretty good right now.

431 Character 2: [resigned laugh] Fine, you win with your reasonable compromise. [mock serious] But I'm still ordering that lava cake. [whispered conspiracy] And I'm leaving the spoons where [sing-song voice] you can reach them easily.

Character 1: [fake stern] You're terrible! [laughing harder] This is exactly why I needed dinner accountability—[grateful tone] but also why I love having meals with you. [tenderly] Thanks for understanding, even when you're being a total enabler.

432 Character 2: [proudly] Enabler is such a harsh word. [philosophical tone] I prefer "curator of life's pleasures." [Warm chuckle] Now let's order before I faint—[dramatically] your talk of vegetables is making me dizzy with hunger!

Script: fd33fc31 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [irritated] Look, this is the third time—third!—that your system has sent the police to my house at 2847 Oak Ridge Drive. [louder] My account number is, uh, K-4-7-2-9-B-6, and I'm absolutely fed up with these false alarms!

433 Customer Support: [apologetic] I'm terribly sorry to hear about this situation, Mr...let me pull up your account. [calmly] K-4-7-2-9-B-6, you said? [concerned] I see here we've had multiple dispatches logged, and I completely understand your frustration.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, you understand? [groans] The officer literally knows my kids' names by now! [more angrily] Yesterday at 3:42 AM—three forty-two!—they showed up because your sensors thought my cat was a burglar.

434 Customer Support: [sympathetic] That must be incredibly disruptive to your family's sleep. [professionally] I'm seeing sensor 14-B in your living room triggered at that exact time. [reassuring] We can definitely recalibrate the sensitivity settings, and I'll also apply a credit of $150 to your account.

Character 1: [skeptically] A credit? [sighs heavily] That doesn't fix the fact that dispatch code 10-54 keeps showing up on my record! [frustrated] My neighbor thinks I'm running some kind of, of criminal enterprise over here because of all the police visits.

435 Customer Support: [understanding] Those dispatch codes can certainly create misunderstandings with neighbors, absolutely. [more confidently] What I can do right now is file report TX-88901-C to clear those false alarms from your record. [helpfully] Would you also like me to schedule a technician for tomorrow?

Character 1: [exasperated] Tomorrow? No, no, I need someone today—T-O-D-A-Y! [pleading] My mother-in-law is coming this weekend, and if, if one more alarm goes off, [dramatically] she'll never let me hear the end of it about "cheap security systems."

436 Customer Support: [quickly] Let me check today's availability in your 78704 area code. [pause] [optimistic] Actually, I have Carlos, technician ID 5522, who can be there between 2:00 and 4:00 PM. [courteously] Would that window work for you, or should I check evening slots?

Character 1: [relieved] Finally, some progress! Yes, 2 to 4 works. [suspicious] But Carlos better know what he's doing—the last guy, employee 3847 or whatever, [mockingly] he just pressed buttons randomly and said "should be good now."

437 Customer Support: [confidently] Carlos is one of our senior technicians with eight years experience. [reassuring] He'll run full diagnostic protocol P-7-7-A on all 16 of your sensors. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any other concerns about your system?

Script: 4c15fc5f | Role: Customer Support

438 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling MediCare Insurance, my name is Sandra. [quickly] How can I assist you today with your healthcare needs?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, hi, I've been trying to get my medication approved for three weeks now. [sighs heavily] My doctor sent the prior authorization twice already, but I keep getting told it's—it's still pending or something.

439 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Oh, I understand how frustrating that must be. [briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick—can I have your member ID and date of birth please?

Character 1: [irritated] It's 4-5-8-7-2-3-9-0-1. [more slowly] Birthday is March fifteenth, 1978. [exasperated] Look, I really need this medication—my doctor says it's essential.

440 Customer Support: [typing tone] Alright, I see your account here, and yes, there is a prior auth request. [quickly] It looks like it was submitted on the tenth, then again on the eighteenth, and [hesitantly] um, it's showing as still under clinical review.

Character 1: [louder] Clinical review? What does that even mean? [groans] I'm literally out of medication as of yesterday—this is for my heart condition!

441 Customer Support: [more apologetically] I completely understand your concern, sir. [rapidly] What happens is our clinical team reviews these requests within five to seven business days, but [pause] sometimes they need additional documentation from your provider.

Character 1: [incredulous] Additional documentation? [sarcastically] My doctor wrote a three-page letter explaining why I need this specific brand! What more could they possibly want?

442 Customer Support: [defensively] Well, sometimes they need specific test results or [quickly] they might want to try a different medication first—it's called step therapy. [more gently] Have you tried the generic alternative before?

Character 1: [angrily] Yes! Of course I have! [sighs] It gave me terrible side effects—that's the whole reason we're doing this! [desperately] Can't you just approve it?

443 Customer Support: [regretfully] I wish I could approve it directly, but I'm not part of the clinical team. [briskly] What I can do is escalate this to urgent status, which should get you a response within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.

Character 1: [skeptically] Twenty-four to forty-eight hours? [groans loudly] That's what they said last week! [firmly] I need to speak to a supervisor, someone who can actually do something.

444 Customer Support: [quickly] I can definitely get you to a supervisor, but just so you know, they'll have the same system access I do. [more hopefully] However, let me first try calling the prior auth department directly while you're on hold—sometimes that helps.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, but if this doesn't work... [pause] [more firmly] I'm filing a formal complaint with the state insurance board. This is literally affecting my health.

445 Customer Support: [reassuringly] I completely understand, and I'm making detailed notes about your situation. [rapidly] Please hold for just a moment while I contact them directly—I'll be back in two to three minutes, okay?

Character 1: [tiredly] Yeah, okay. [muttering] Two to three minutes... [sighs] I'll believe it when I hear it.

446 Customer Support: [more cheerfully] Hi Mr. Johnson, good news! [quickly] I spoke with the prior auth team and they're expediting your case—they actually just need one clarification about dosage from your doctor.

Character 1: [surprised] Really? [cautiously optimistic] Just the dosage? [confused] But the prescription clearly states thirty milligrams twice daily—what's unclear about that?

447 Customer Support: [apologetically] I know it seems redundant, but they need it specifically noted in the prior auth form, not just the prescription. [briskly] If your doctor's office can fax that today, we can have approval by tomorrow morning.

Character 1: [relieved] Tomorrow morning—you promise? [sighs deeply] Alright, I'll call them right now. [gratefully] Thank you for actually helping, Sandra, instead of just... reading from a script.

467 [Fast] [Happy] Alright everyone, I'm done rambling—let's raise our glasses to love, laughter, and happily ever after! [Shout] Cheers!

468 SCENARIO: Offhandedly describing a water bottle they've been refilling, then looking inside it, then seeing buildup they've been drinking from for who knows how long, spiraling into bottle neglect disgust

==================================================

[casual]

Oh yeah, and I've been, um, I've been using this same water bottle all week. You know, the, uh, the blue one? Just keep refilling it, keep refilling it. Very, um, very environmentally conscious of me, right?

[matter-of-fact]

I mean it's— it's fine, it's just water, you know? I rinse it out sometimes when I, um, when I remember to. But like, water's water, it's not— it's not like I'm putting, uh, putting milk in there or something gross.

[slight concern]

Actually, now that I'm— now that I'm thinking about it, I can't really, um, I can't remember the last time I actually washed it. Like, uh, like properly washed it with soap and— [pause] Wait, hang on.

[growing unease]

Oh. Oh no. There's like— there's like little, um, little floaty things in here. And the bottom is— [sharp exhale] oh god, the bottom is like, uh, it's slimy? There's this weird film and I can see— I can see like chunks of something.

[disgusted realization]

How long have I been— [groan] how long have I been drinking this? I've been, um, I've been chugging this thing for days! There's literally— there's mold! There's actual mold growing in— [gag] oh my god, I can smell it now.

[spiraling disgust]

I'm gonna be sick. I'm literally— I'm gonna throw up. I've been, uh, I've been basically drinking swamp water for who knows how long and I just— [whimper] why didn't I look? Why don't I ever— [frustrated groan] This is so disgusting, I can't— I can't even—
