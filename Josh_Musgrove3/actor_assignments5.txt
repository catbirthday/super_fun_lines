Character 1: We were supposed to hang out today.

355 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, I—wait, that was today? I thought—no no no, I'm so sorry. I completely spaced, I thought it was next Saturday.

Character 1: I waited for an hour.

356 Character 2: You waited? Shit, I—I'm the worst. I'm literally the worst friend ever. I was with my cousin and we just—I dunno, time got away from me and I wasn't checking my phone. [groan] This is so bad.

Character 1: Your cousin. Right.

357 Character 2: No, I know how that sounds but she's only in town for like—that's not an excuse. That's totally not an excuse, I know. I shoulda checked my calendar, I shoulda remembered. We've been planning this for weeks.

Character 1: Three weeks, actually.

358 Character 2: Three weeks. Yeah. God, I just—I don't know what's wrong with me lately. I've been so scattered and I keep—I keep doing this thing where I double-book myself and it's not fair to anyone. [nervous laugh] Especially not to you.

Character 1: This is the second time.

359 Character 2: I know. I know it is, and that makes it so much worse, right? Like once is bad enough but twice is—that's a pattern. That's me being a terrible friend who doesn't prioritize you and I hate that. I really, really hate that.

Character 1: So what now?

360 Character 2: Um, I mean—can I make it up to you? Like tomorrow or—or whenever you're free? I'll cancel whatever I have, I swear. Actually wait, let me just—let me check right now so I don't mess up again.

Character 1: I don't know if I want to make plans with you.

361 Character 2: That's—yeah, that's fair. [sigh] That's completely fair. I wouldn't wanna make plans with me either. But I promise I can—I can do better. I bought a planner! Like an actual physical one so I can't just ignore notifications.

Character 1: A planner won't fix you forgetting about me.

362 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right, it's not—it's not about the planner, it's about me not being present, y'know? Not valuing our friendship the way I should. And I do value it, I swear I do, I'm just really bad at showing it apparently.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

363 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better. Not just say it but actually do it. Like, our next plan? I'm putting it in my phone, my planner, telling my roommate to remind me. Whatever it takes. Because losing you as a friend would just—that would break me, honestly.

Character 1: I need you to actually mean that.

364 Character 2: I do mean it. I know I've—I've given you reasons to doubt me but I really, truly mean it. You're one of my best friends and I've been taking you for granted and that stops now. It has to.

365 SCENARIO: discovering the thing they need is on the top shelf

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I need the, um— where did they put the cereal? I swear it used to be, like, right here on the— on the middle shelf, but now it's just... [sigh] of course. Of course it's not there.

[slightly annoyed]

Let me just— let me look around here. Maybe they moved it to, um, to a different... [tsk] nope. Not there either. This is, uh, this is why I hate when they reorganize the whole— the whole grocery store layout.

[resigned]

Oh wait. Wait wait wait. [drawn out] Up there. It's up there, isn't it? On the very top shelf. Because why would it be, um, why would it be anywhere a normal person could reach it?

[determined but wary]

Okay, so I just need to— I mean, how hard can it be? I'll just, uh, I'll stretch up and... [grunt] nope. Nope, that's not— that's not happening. My arms are apparently too short for, um, for modern grocery shopping.

[contemplative]

Do I ask someone? I could ask that guy over there, but he looks busy and I don't want to— [hmm] or maybe there's like a step stool or something? Do stores have those?

[accepting]

You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm gonna grab a different cereal. The universe is clearly telling me to try something new today. [laugh] Or maybe it's telling me to grow taller, but that ship has, uh, that ship has sailed.

Script: da2956fc | Role: Character 1 (A)

366 Character 1: [Screaming] OH MY GOD, IS THAT—NO WAY! [gasping] You got the constellation too?! [voice cracking with joy] I literally just got mine done yesterday, I was going to surprise you at dinner but this is absolutely insane!

Character 2: [shrieking] SHUT UP, SHUT UP! [breathless] Are you kidding me right now? [louder] I've been hiding mine under bandages for three days! Look, it's even in the same spot—left shoulder blade, exactly where we always said!

367 Character 1: [trembling whisper] This can't be real. [building excitement] We didn't plan this, we didn't even— [explosive laugh] Wait, did you go to Midnight Ink too? Please tell me you went to Jake, the guy with the purple mohawk!

Character 2: [hysterical giggle] Stop it, I'm actually going to cry! [softer] Jake did mine on Tuesday afternoon. [voice rising] He said someone came in with the exact same design—that was you! We're literally cosmic twins or something!

368 Character 1: [choked up] Remember when we were fifteen? [steadier] We swore on your mom's porch swing that we'd get matching tattoos someday. [whispered awe] But we never decided what, and somehow we both chose Cassiopeia independently.

Character 2: [sniffling] The Queen constellation, because you always called me dramatic royalty. [more intensely] I can't breathe, this is the most us thing that's ever happened. [squealing] We need to document this immediately—where's your phone?

369 Character 1: [frantically] It's in my bag somewhere— [sharp intake] Oh wait, look closer at yours! [hushed amazement] Do you see that tiny star near the bottom point? Mine has that too, it wasn't even in the original design!

Character 2: [barely audible] The artist added it. [stronger] He said it felt incomplete without it, like something was calling for that extra detail. [rapid words] This is genuinely freaking me out in the best possible way, how is this real?

370 Character 1: [giddy laughter] Mom's going to lose her mind when she finds out. [sarcastically sweet] "You two share a brain cell," she always says. [earnest shout] But this proves we share a soul—we're basically telepathic!

Character 2: [mock serious] We should start a psychic hotline. [giggling] "Got a question about your future? Call the constellation twins!" [tender whisper] But seriously, I love you so much, this is the most perfect accident ever.

371 Character 1: [wobbly voice] Don't make me cry in this coffee shop! [laughing through tears] Everyone's already staring because we screamed like banshees. [quietly intense] I vote we make this our thing—spontaneous twin decisions forever.

Character 2: [determined] Yes! Next time we accidentally buy the same car or something. [more playfully] Though hopefully something less permanent than skin art. [sudden realization] Oh my god, wait—did yours hurt like hell on that bony part too?

372 Character 1: [groaning] The worst pain ever! [animated] I literally had to bite my jacket sleeve during that section. [dropping lower] But Jake kept saying "beauty is pain, darling" in that ridiculous accent of his.

Character 2: [cackling] He said the same thing to me! [mimicking] "Darling, the stars demand sacrifice." [normal voice] I almost walked out, but then I remembered how much I wanted this constellation on me forever.

373 Character 1: [thoughtfully soft] You know what's crazy? [building energy] Last week I had this vivid dream about stars aligning on our shoulders. [mysterious whisper] I thought it was just random subconscious nonsense, but maybe not.

Character 2: [stunned silence] Stop. [shaky] I had a dream about constellations too—we were floating in space, drawing them with our fingers. [getting louder] This is officially entering twilight zone territory, I have literal goosebumps everywhere!

374 Character 1: [reverent] We need to celebrate this properly. [excitedly faster] Champagne, terrible karaoke, the works! [shouting] Tonight we're telling everyone the story of the telepathic tattoo miracle, whether they want to hear it or not!

Character 2: [melodramatic] This will be our legacy! [cheerfully] Two idiots, one shared brain cell, zero coordination, yet somehow perfect synchronization when it matters. [softening] Our grandkids won't believe this story—hell, I barely believe it myself.

375 Character 1: [breathless rush] Quick, let's take a picture with them visible! [commanding] Stand back to back—no wait, side by side! [giddy] We're going to break the internet with this twin magic situation we've created!

Character 2: [pure joy] I'm never taking off tank tops again, everyone needs to see this! [overwhelmed] Best friends who accidentally get matching tattoos stay together forever, right? [screaming again] God, I love us so much—we're absolutely legendary!

Script: f69b5a8f | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [angry] Yes, hello, I need to speak to someone about my claim—uh, reference number B-47291-X. [louder] Your movers destroyed my grandmother's Victorian tea set! [disgusted] The one that survived two world wars, and your guys managed to, to shatter it in one trip from 1847 Maple Street.

376 Customer Support: [apologetic] Oh dear, I'm so sorry to hear about your antiques, sir. [professionally] Let me pull up your file—B-47291-X, you said? [reassuring tone] I see here the move was completed on October 15th, and yes, there's a damage report filed.

Character 1: [sarcastically] A damage report? [shouting] That's what you call three generations of family heirlooms turned into—into expensive garbage? [bitterly] The invoice says "fragile handling," which apparently meant throwing boxes like, like they're training for the Olympics!

377 Customer Support: [calmly] Sir, I completely understand your frustration, and we take these matters very seriously. [sympathetic] According to our records, you purchased our Premium Protection Plan for $289. [more firmly] Let me transfer you to our claims specialist, extension 4-0-7, who can discuss compensation options.

Character 1: [incredulous] Compensation? [getting louder] You think money replaces a 150-year-old Tiffany lamp? [groans] My insurance agent—State Farm policy number SF-889214—already said your company is liable for the full $47,000 appraisal value!

378 Customer Support: [nervous] Forty-seven thousand? [pause] [more composed] Sir, our maximum coverage under the Premium Plan is, um, $15,000 per shipment. [carefully] However, if you have documentation—receipts, appraisals dated before September 30th—we can certainly escalate this to management.

Character 1: [furiously] I have everything—appraisals, photos, even a certificate from Christie's Auction House dated August 12th! [demanding] Your driver, badge number M-2094, he signed the inventory sheet acknowledging high-value items. [mockingly] Or does his signature mean nothing to SafeMove Express?

379 Customer Support: [defensive] Our drivers' acknowledgments are absolutely binding, sir. [more confidently] Let me check—yes, Marcus Williams, employee M-2094, did note "antique collection" on the manifest. [helpful tone] Can you email your documentation to claims@safemove.com, attention case B-47291-X?

Character 1: [exasperated] Email? [laughs bitterly] I already sent seventeen emails to that address, plus registered mail to your headquarters at 5000 Industrial Boulevard! [venomously] Nobody responds except with those, those insulting form letters saying "we value your patience."

380 Customer Support: [sighs] [apologetically] You're right, our response time has been unacceptable. [determined] I'm personally escalating this to our regional manager, Sandra Chen, right now. [reassuring] She'll contact you within 24 hours at—let me confirm—is 555-0147 still your best number?

Script: 9893a5c1 | Role: Customer Support

381 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Good afternoon, FitLife Gym, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I've been trying to use the leg press machine for three days now and—[sighs heavily]—the thing is completely broken. The pin won't even go into the weight stack properly.

382 Customer Support: [apologetically] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that inconvenience. [more quickly] Let me just pull up our maintenance log here to see what's—um—what's happening with that equipment.

Character 1: [impatiently] This is the third time I'm calling about this! [groans] I pay seventy bucks a month and half the machines are either broken or have "out of order" signs on them.

383 Customer Support: [defensively] I understand your frustration, sir, and I can see here that—[pause]—well, actually, there's no record of previous calls about the leg press. [more softly] Are you sure you called us about this specific machine?

Character 1: [loudly] Of course I'm sure! [exasperated] I spoke to someone named Jennifer on Monday, then some guy—I think Tom—on Wednesday. Nobody ever writes anything down there, do they?

384 Customer Support: [quickly] Sir, I'll definitely make note of this right now, and—[more firmly]—I can assure you we take these issues seriously. Our maintenance team should be able to look at it by... let me check... Monday afternoon.

Character 1: [incredulous] Monday? That's four more days! [sarcastically] Should I just do air squats in the parking lot until then, or maybe bench press my membership card?

385 Customer Support: [nervously] I know it's not ideal, but our technician only comes twice a week and he's—[clears throat]—he's already booked for Friday. [more hopefully] Would you like a complimentary day pass for another location?

Character 1: [resigned] Your other location is forty-five minutes away. [sighs] Look, can I at least get some kind of credit on my membership for all these broken machines?

386 Customer Support: [hesitantly] Well, our policy doesn't typically allow for credits due to equipment issues, but—[pause]—let me speak with my manager. [quickly] Can you hold for just one moment?

Character 1: [muttering] Sure, why not, I've got nothing better to do than—[more loudly]—yes, fine, I'll hold.

387 Customer Support: [briskly] Okay, I'm back! [cheerfully] Good news—my manager approved a fifteen dollar credit for this month's inconvenience.

Character 1: [skeptically] Fifteen dollars? That's not even a week's worth of membership. [frustrated grunt] The cable machine has been broken for two months, the water fountain doesn't work...

388 Customer Support: [interrupting quickly] Sir, I can add those to our maintenance list right now! [more sympathetically] I know it's been frustrating, and honestly, we've had some staffing issues with our maintenance crew lately.

Character 1: [tiredly] You know what, just—just make sure someone actually fixes the leg press by Monday. [pause] And maybe update your system so people's complaints don't disappear into the void?

389 Customer Support: [professionally] Absolutely, I'm documenting everything we discussed today under your account. [rapidly] That's the leg press, cable machine, and water fountain on the main floor, correct?

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, you're actually writing it down? [more hopefully] Yes, that's right, and the men's locker room door that sticks—almost trapped someone in there yesterday.

390 Customer Support: [reassuringly] Got it all noted here, and I'm sending an urgent flag to maintenance about that door—that's definitely a safety issue. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Character 1: [resigned] No, that's—that's everything. [sighs] Just please make sure someone actually shows up on Monday, alright?

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

391 [Happy] Oh wow, this is, uh, this is really something! [Nervous laugh] I mean, you definitely put a lot of thought into this, didn't you?

392 [Slow] It's so... unique. [Tsk] I've literally never seen anything quite like it before in my entire life.

393 [Fast] You shouldn't have—no really, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble! [Chuckle] Must've been hard to find!

394 [Whisper] Where am I even gonna put this thing? [Sigh] I guess I could maybe rearrange the whole living room or something.

395 [Sarcastic] Perfect, this is exactly what I needed to complete my collection of, um, of things. [Disappointed] Thanks so much.

396 [Sad] I'm just—I'm kinda overwhelmed right now, you know? [Slow] This is a lot to take in, honestly.

397 [Angry] No, no, I love it! [Fast] Why would you think I don't love it? I'm smiling, aren't I?

398 [Happy] How did you even know I wanted one of these? [Tsk] [Sarcastic] Must be psychic or something, right?

399 [Disappointed] Oh. [Long pause] [Slow] This is the one from that store we passed last month, isn't it?

400 [Shout] SURPRISE! [Nervous laugh] [Fast] Wait, that's what I'm supposed to say? Or—never mind, thank you!

401 [Whisper] Is there a gift receipt in here somewhere, or... [Tsk] [Fast] Just wondering about the warranty, that's all!

402 [Slow] You know what? [Sigh] I'm gonna treasure this forever and ever, I really mean that.

403 [Angry] This must've cost you a fortune! [Disappointed] You really, really didn't need to spend money on—on this.

404 [Fast] I can't wait to show everyone what you got me! [Sarcastic] They're gonna be so jealous, I bet.

405 [Happy] I'm speechless, literally cannot find the words right now! [Groan] [Whisper] Because what would I even say?

406 [Sad] It reminds me of something my grandmother used to have, actually. [Chuckle] Different color though, thankfully—I mean, luckily!

407 [Shout] You remembered! [Fast] From that one conversation six months ago where I definitely didn't say I hated these!

408 [Disappointed] Hmm, interesting choice. [Slow] I guess this is what you think of when you think of me, huh?

409 [Sarcastic] Gotta say, this is almost as good as last year's gift! [Laugh] Remember that disaster—I mean, that lovely surprise?

410 [Whisper] I'm gonna need a minute to, uh, to process this properly. [Sigh] [Slow] It's just so much more than I expected, y'know?

411 SCENARIO: Annoyed about a long pharmacy wait, then the pharmacist catches a dangerous interaction

==================================================

[frustrated]

Ugh, so I went to pick up my prescription today and it was like— it was like a forty-five minute wait. Forty-five minutes! For something that should take like two seconds, you know?

[annoyed]

And they kept calling people who came in after me, and I'm just standing there like an idiot watching everyone else get their stuff. The pharmacist kept disappearing into the back for like ten minutes at a time, and I'm thinking, what are you doing back there? [scoff] Making the pills from scratch?

[irritated]

I had to miss my lunch break for this, and I'm getting more and more annoyed, and finally when they call my name I'm just like, thank God, let's get this over with. I just want to grab it and leave.

[surprised] [suddenly attentive]

But then— wait, so the pharmacist looks at my bag and she's like, "Hold on, what other medications are you taking?" And I tell her about the stuff my doctor prescribed last week for my back, and her face just— her face completely changes.

[quieter] [a bit shaken]

She goes, "Oh no, you can't take these together. This could cause serious heart problems." Like, serious heart problems. My doctor's office never— they never checked, they just wrote the prescription.

[grateful] [slightly overwhelmed]

So that forty-five minute wait that I was so mad about? It like— it might have actually saved my life. God, I feel terrible for being so rude to her now.
