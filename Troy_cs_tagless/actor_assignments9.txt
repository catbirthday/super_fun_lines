Character 1: Three months. That's how long it's been.

688 Character 2: Oh god, has it really been—wait, three months? No no no, that can't be right. I mean, we saw each other at... um... actually when was that party? [nervous laugh] Okay, you're right, I've been terrible.

Character 1: You canceled on me four times.

689 Character 2: I know, I know, and every time I felt like absolute garbage about it. It's just—work has been insane, like genuinely insane, and then my mom needed help with the house stuff and I—that's not an excuse though. I'm not trying to make excuses.

Character 1: Sure sounds like it.

690 Character 2: You're right. God, you're—you're totally right. I'm doing that thing where I just ramble and try to justify everything instead of just... I'm sorry. I've been a really shitty friend lately.

Character 1: Lately?

691 Character 2: Okay, not just lately. Since like—since January maybe? When I got the promotion and started dating Alex and everything just kinda... [sigh] I basically disappeared on you. And that's not okay. Like, at all.

Character 1: I needed you last month. When everything happened with Dad.

692 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm—I'm the worst. I saw your text and I meant to call you back, I swear I did, but then I got pulled into this meeting and—no, that doesn't matter. I should've been there. I should've dropped everything and been there for you.

Character 1: Yeah. You should have.

693 Character 2: I don't—I don't even know how to apologize for that. Like, there's literally nothing I can say that makes it better. You've always been there for me, always, and the one time you really needed me, I just... wasn't.

Character 1: It wasn't just one time though, was it?

694 Character 2: No. No, it wasn't. [groan] I've been so caught up in my own stuff that I didn't even—I mean, I knew I was being distant but I kept telling myself "next week I'll make time" and then next week would come and I'd just... do it again.

Character 1: I stopped trying to make plans.

695 Character 2: Wait, what? When did you—oh. Oh, that's why it's been three months. Because I haven't... because you stopped reaching out and I didn't even notice. God, that's even worse somehow.

Character 1: Pretty much, yeah.

696 Character 2: Can we—would you maybe wanna get coffee? Like right now? I know that doesn't fix anything, and I know you probably don't even want to, but I just... I miss you. I miss us. And I know that's my fault but—

Character 1: I have an hour before work.

697 Character 2: Really? You'd actually—okay, yes, absolutely. Um, our usual place? I'll buy, obviously, and we can just... talk? Or not talk, if you don't wanna. I just—thank you. Seriously, thank you for even giving me the chance.

Script: e104ac5b_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I got in.

698 Character 2: Got in? Wait wait wait—what do you mean you got in? Oh my god, is this about the—the volunteer thing?

Character 1: The animal shelter. Yeah.

699 Character 2: Shut up! Are you serious? [Gasp] Oh my god, you actually—I mean, I knew you applied but like, wow, this is actually happening! When do you start?

Character 1: Next Saturday. Orientation at nine.

700 Character 2: This is so, so perfect for you. Like honestly? You've been talking about wanting to do this for—what, like a year now? Maybe more?

Character 1: Two years, actually.

701 Character 2: Two years! See, that's—that's even crazier. And you finally just went for it. What made you actually, y'know, pull the trigger?

Character 1: Saw a dog get hit last month. Couldn't stop thinking about it.

702 Character 2: Oh. Oh honey, that's—[Sigh] yeah, I remember you mentioning that. That must've been really hard to see.

Character 1: The driver didn't even stop.

703 Character 2: People are just—ugh, I can't even. But like, at least now you're gonna be part of the solution, right? Making things better for these animals?

Character 1: That's the plan. We'll see.

704 Character 2: Okay no no no, none of this "we'll see" stuff. You're gonna be amazing at this. You're literally the most patient person I know—and animals? They totally sense that kinda energy.

Character 1: I just hope I don't get too attached.

705 Character 2: Oh, you're definitely gonna get attached. Like, completely, ridiculously attached. [Chuckle] But isn't that—I mean, isn't that kinda the point? Caring enough to actually help?

Character 1: My apartment doesn't allow pets.

706 Character 2: Wait, are you already—oh my god, you're already thinking about adopting one, aren't you? This is day zero and you're already planning!

Character 1: Maybe just fostering. That's different.

707 Character 2: Uh-huh, sure, "just fostering." We both know you're gonna end up with like three dogs by Christmas. And honestly? I'm here for it.

708 SCENARIO: trying to remember what day of the week it is

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, what day is it today? I feel like I should know this. I should— I should definitely know what day of the week it is, right? [sigh] This is, uh, this is kind of embarrassing.

[slightly confused]

Let me think. Yesterday was, um— yesterday was... [hmm] okay, I went to the grocery store yesterday, and I always go on, like, Sundays usually. So if yesterday was Sunday, then today would be— wait, no, that's not— that's not right.

[faster, working it out]

Actually, hold on. The grocery store was super crowded, which means it was probably a weekend day, but I also had to, um, I had to do laundry, and I never do laundry on Sundays because that's when everyone else— [tsk] ugh, this is not helping.

[more focused]

Okay okay okay, let me just— what did I do this morning? I had my usual coffee, nothing special planned, no alarms went off screaming at me, so it's probably not a Monday. That's something, right?

[slightly defeated]

You know what? I'm just gonna, um, I'm just gonna check my phone like a normal person. [laugh] Why am I making this so complicated? It's probably, like, Wednesday or something perfectly normal.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 99a0f12f | Role: Character 1 (A)

709 Character 1: [worried] I've been tracking my pulse, and it jumped from 72 to 74 [voice rising] when I stood up! [Gasp] That can't be normal. Plus, my left eyelid twitched twice this morning—I read that could mean a brain tumor.

Character 2: [exhausted sigh] Mr. Peterson, a two-beat increase is completely normal when standing. [firmly] Your eyelid twitching is probably from the [slower] six cups of coffee you mentioned drinking before noon. When did you last actually sleep through the night?

710 Character 1: [defensive] Sleep? How can I sleep when my pillowcase might be harboring bacteria? [whispered frantically] I wash it daily, but what if that's not enough? [louder] Yesterday, I sneezed three times in a row—definitely allergies or possibly early-stage pneumonia!

Character 2: [monotone] Three sneezes is not pneumonia. [more exasperated] It's October; everyone's sneezing from ragweed. [Groan] Mr. Peterson, you've been here four times this week. Your only condition is anxiety about having conditions—please consider the therapist referral.

711 Character 1: [high-pitched] But what about this freckle? [trembling] It's slightly darker than last Tuesday's photo! I've documented every mole with timestamped pictures. [urgently] And my tongue—look—there's a white spot that wasn't there during breakfast!

Character 2: [through gritted teeth] That's toothpaste residue. [Bitter laugh] I can literally see the mint specks. [steadier] Your freckles haven't changed since your dermatology clearance last month. Have you been using that meditation app I recommended at all?

712 Character 1: [rapidly] Meditation makes me notice my breathing, then I count breaths, then they seem irregular! [panicked whisper] What if I forget how to breathe automatically? [Nervous laugh] Also, my left knee clicked when I bent it—bone cancer?

Character 2: [deadpan] Knees click. Joints pop. [sarcastically sweet] Bodies make noise—it's called being alive. [Sharp exhale] You're thirty-two, not falling apart. Maybe try focusing on something besides WebMD for once? Your search history must be terrifying.

713 Character 1: [indignant] I use medical journals too! [quieter] Speaking of which, my urine was slightly yellower this morning. [building panic] Kidney failure starts subtly—I've prepared a color chart comparing every bathroom visit since Monday. Should we run labs?

Character 2: [barely contained] Darker urine means dehydration. [Forced laugh] Drink water instead of analyzing it. [pleading] Mr. Peterson, you're the healthiest person here—including me. I haven't had lunch in eight hours because of actual emergencies, unlike these scenarios.

714 Character 1: [hurt] These feel like emergencies to me! [softer] What if we miss something important? [voice cracking] My grandmother ignored a headache once and—well, you know. [firmly] I just need reassurance that this weird ear pressure isn't serious.

Character 2: [gentler] It's autumn allergies causing ear pressure. [Soft sigh] I understand you're scared about your health. [more firmly] But coming here daily won't fix anxiety. That therapist specializes in health anxiety—she really could help you live peacefully.

715 Character 1: [reluctantly] Maybe you're right about therapy. [hopeful] But first, could you check this rash? [quickly] It appeared after I used new soap, but rashes can indicate autoimmune disorders! I've photographed its progression hourly since yesterday evening.

Character 2: [wearily] That's contact dermatitis from the soap. [matter-of-fact] Stop using it, apply cortisone cream. [Chuckle] Your immune system is fine—it's just angry about lavender-eucalyptus-whatever nonsense. Please, make the therapy appointment today, not tomorrow.

716 Character 1: [sheepishly] I actually already booked it for Thursday. [nervous laugh] But what if I get sick before then? [whispering] My throat feels slightly scratchy right now—strep? COVID? [regular volume] Something worse that starts with throat symptoms?

Character 2: [relieved] Thursday's great! [encouragingly] The scratch is probably from talking non-stop about symptoms. [Gentle laugh] Try some tea with honey. You'll survive until Thursday, I promise—you've survived every other health scare you've imagined beautifully.

717 Character 1: [brightening] You really think I'll be okay? [quieter] Sometimes I forget what feeling normal is like. [wistful] I used to play basketball without checking my pulse every timeout. [sadly] Now I carry a blood pressure cuff everywhere.

Character 2: [warmly] Normal is still there, waiting for you. [sympathetic] Anxiety just buried it under worry. [more upbeat] The therapist will help you find it again. Meanwhile, maybe leave the medical devices at home—trust your body's wisdom.

718 Character 1: [determined] You're right, I'll try. [shakily] Starting tomorrow, no symptom googling before breakfast. [more confident] And I'll limit pulse checks to twice daily. [Nervous giggle] That's progress, right? Even if my stomach feels weird right now?

Character 2: [proudly] That's huge progress! [laughing] Your stomach feels weird because you skipped lunch obsessing over symptoms. [kindly] Go eat something real, take a walk, call a friend. [firmly] I'll see you next month—not next week.

Script: 1c3f617e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [mumbling] Yeah, so I'm calling about the, uh, the closing thing tomorrow at 2847 Maple... wait no, [confused] was it 2487? [frustrated groan] My confirmation number is like XB7-something-Q92, and I need to know about the... the papers.

719 Customer Support: Good morning, this is Sarah from Premier Title Company. [slightly concerned] Could you please repeat your confirmation number more slowly? And just to clarify, are you referring to the closing scheduled for property 2847 Maple Drive?

Character 1: [speaking too fast] No, no, no, it's definitely XB7... [long pause] ...K or maybe Q, then 92-F. [getting louder] The realtor said something about bringing certified... things? [nervously] Do I need my passport and also that W-9 form or was it W-2?

720 Customer Support: Let me look that up for you, one moment please. I see here confirmation XB7-Q92-F for tomorrow at 10:30 AM. [helpfully] You'll need to bring a certified check for $47,892.50 and two forms of government-issued ID.

Character 1: [panicked] Ten thirty?! [exhales sharply] My wife said 2:30 PM! [rambling quickly] And wait, forty-seven thousand eight hundred... how much? [confused mumbling] The mortgage guy said something about thirty-seven thousand or was that just the down payment minus the earnest thingy?

721 Customer Support: Sir, please don't worry, let me verify everything for you. The closing is indeed at 10:30 AM at our office, suite 205-B. The certified check amount includes your down payment, closing costs, and prepaids totaling exactly $47,892.50.

Character 1: [distracted] Suite 205... [trails off] ...or was it 250? [suddenly loud] Oh! And my accountant needs something called a HUD-1 or a CD form? [rapid breathing] Can you email that to jim@... no wait, [correcting] james.t.buyer@emailplace.net?

722 Customer Support: [slightly exasperated] That would be suite 205-B, second floor. The Closing Disclosure, or CD form, was already sent three business days ago. I can resend it now to the email address you just provided, is that J-A-M-E-S dot T?

Character 1: [interrupting] Yes, yes, but also send to my wife at... [muttering] ...something like mary.buyer74 or 47? [sudden realization] Oh God! [frantically] Do we both need to be there if the deed says "joint tenancy with rights of whatever"?

723 Customer Support: Yes, both parties listed on the purchase agreement must attend. That would be you and Mary Buyer, correct? I'll need you both to sign approximately 127 documents, and the whole process typically takes about 90 minutes.

Character 1: [overwhelmed groan] A hundred and twenty... what now? [whispers anxiously] My hand's gonna fall off. [suddenly remembering] Oh, and parking! Is there parking at 1500 Commerce Street or wait, [confused again] are you at 1500 Continental Avenue?

724 Customer Support: [with controlled patience] We're located at 1500 Commerce Street, yes. There's free validated parking in the attached garage, levels P1 through P3. Just bring your parking ticket to our office and we'll stamp it for you.

Character 1: [relieved sigh] Okay, okay good. [muttering quickly] So tomorrow, 10:30, suite 250... no, 205-B, both of us, certified check... [panicking again] Wait! Can I write a personal check instead if I show my bank balance on my phone?

725 Customer Support: I'm afraid not, sir, it must be a certified or cashier's check. [more firmly] Personal checks cannot be accepted for closing funds per federal regulations. Your bank can issue a certified check this afternoon if you visit them before 4 PM.

Character 1: [groaning loudly] The bank closes at 4? [speaking rapidly] Mine closes at 5, or is it 4:30 on Tuesdays? [desperately] What if I bring cash, like forty-seven thousand in hundreds? [hopeful] That's only like, uh, 470 bills, right?

726 Customer Support: Sir, we cannot accept cash payments over $10,000. [more seriously] It must be a certified check or wire transfer only. Would you like me to provide our wire instructions with routing number 021000021 and account 5567-8890-12?

Character 1: [sighs deeply] Wire transfer sounds complicated. [mumbling numbers] Zero-two-one-zero... wait, how many zeros? [suddenly alert] And if we're late tomorrow, do we lose the house? [voice rising] My wife will absolutely murder me if we lose the house!

727 Customer Support: [soothingly] Don't worry, being a few minutes late won't cancel your purchase. However, please do aim to arrive by 10:30 AM as scheduled. I'm emailing you a complete checklist right now with all requirements including the wire instructions just in case.

Character 1: [somewhat calmer] Okay, email it to james.t... [correcting himself] No wait, use the other one, jbuyer1975@differentemail.com. [muttering] Or maybe both? [suddenly remembering] Oh! Do I need to transfer utilities before closing or after? The gas company wants account number 445-667-8890-J.

728 Customer Support: [wrapping up] I'll send the checklist to both email addresses you've provided. [informatively] Utility transfers should be scheduled for your closing date, March 15th. Is there anything else about tomorrow's 10:30 AM closing at suite 205-B that you need clarified? We'll see you and Mrs. Buyer tomorrow morning.

Script: 7d2a2c2a | Role: Customer Support

729 Customer Support: Alright, let's check your water softener settings real quick. Your hardness should be set to match your water test results—what number did you get, somewhere between 7 and 25 grains?

Character 1: [confused] I... I don't know what grains are? [nervously] The manual says something about, um, regeneration cycles and [pause] salt dosage, but [frustrated sigh] none of this makes any sense to me.

730 Customer Support: No worries, grains just measure how hard your water is. Did you get a test kit with the unit, or—actually, let me ask—when you run water, do you see white spots on dishes?

Character 1: [exasperated] White spots? [louder] Everything has white spots! [groans] My shower door looks frosted, my faucets are crusty, and [desperately] I've been adding salt every week but nothing's changing.

731 Customer Support: Every week? That's way too much salt—you're probably stuck in constant regeneration. [rapidly] Quick question: what's your capacity setting showing, and is the time display blinking or solid?

Character 1: [hesitant] The display shows... twelve hundred something? [slowly] And there's definitely blinking, like, [frustrated] three different numbers that keep changing. [defeated] Should I just call a plumber instead?

732 Customer Support: [quickly] No, no, we can fix this right now. That twelve hundred is your capacity—totally wrong for residential use. Press and hold the up arrow, then tap down twice when it beeps.

Character 1: [skeptical] Okay, pressing up... [surprised] Oh! It beeped really loud. [uncertainly] Now it says "HD" and a number twenty-five? [worried] Did I break it, because that seems really high?

733 Customer Support: Perfect, that's your hardness setting! Twenty-five is actually pretty hard water, so that explains the spots. [more patiently] Now hit next—we need to set regeneration to, um, [calculating] probably every four days for your household.

Character 1: [relieved chuckle] Four days, not every day like I had it. [embarrassed] No wonder my water bill was insane last month. [curiously] But wait, how do I know when it's actually, you know, [pause] working properly?

734 Customer Support: You'll hear it regenerate at 2 AM—sounds like rushing water for about ninety minutes. [reassuring] The spots should disappear within a week, and your soap will get super sudsy, almost too much actually.

Character 1: [thoughtful] Two in the morning, that explains the weird noises. [laughs nervously] I thought I had ghost plumbers or something. [more seriously] So just leave it alone now, [questioning] or should I still add salt weekly?

735 Customer Support: Ghost plumbers, that's a new one. Check salt monthly, not weekly—it should be at least one-third full, but never pack it to the top, that causes bridges.

Character 1: [confused] Bridges? [incredulous] Like actual bridges in my salt tank? [pause] I'm sorry, but [overwhelmed] every answer creates two more questions here—is there a simple guide somewhere?

736 Customer Support: Salt bridges are just hardened salt chunks that block water flow. [more briskly] Look, I'll email you our quick-start guide, but honestly, you're all set now—these settings should handle everything automatically.

Character 1: [grateful] Oh thank god, an email guide would be amazing. [hopefully] Will it explain what all these buttons do, because [sheepishly] I've been afraid to touch half of them since installation.

737 Customer Support: Most customers never need those other buttons anyway. The guide covers the basics—hardness, regeneration time, and salt level indicators. Don't overthink it; water softeners are simpler than they seem.

Character 1: [relieved sigh] Simpler than they seem, sure. [sarcastically] Says the person who knows what grain capacity regeneration cycles mean. [genuinely] But seriously, thanks for not making me feel stupid about this.

738 Customer Support: Hey, nobody's born knowing water chemistry. You figured out the settings faster than most people do, and now you're good for probably years—just salt, wait, and enjoy spot-free dishes.

Character 1: [optimistic] Spot-free dishes sound like a dream. [gratefully] Thanks for talking me through this instead of just, you know, [lighter] sending me back to that horrible manual. [determined] I'm actually excited to see this thing finally work right!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

739 [Happy] Oh wow, you're the one who, um, who started that whole charity thing, right? [Fast] That's honestly incredible—I've been following your work for like months now!

740 [Nervous] [Laugh] I actually practiced what I was gonna say in the car, but now I'm just—yeah, totally blanking on everything.

741 [Slow] So I heard you're into rock climbing... [Chuckle] I mean, I've never tried it myself, but it seems kinda terrifying and amazing at the same time?

742 [Whisper] Between you and me, I was super nervous about meeting everyone today. [Fast] But you guys seem way more chill than I expected, so that's good.

743 [Sarcastic] Oh great, I just spilled coffee on myself—really nailing this whole "professional" thing, aren't I? [Groan]

744 [Happy] Your dog is literally the cutest thing I've ever—can I pet him? [Laugh] Sorry, I get kinda weird around animals.

745 [Fast] I know we just met, but I gotta say, your presentation earlier was like—it completely changed how I think about the whole project.

746 [Disappointed] I had this whole clever introduction planned, but then I, uh... [Sigh] I forgot your name already and now it's too awkward to ask.

747 [Slow] That's such an interesting perspective on—actually, I never thought about it that way before. [Chuckle] You're kinda blowing my mind here.

748 [Angry] No no no, I didn't mean it like—ugh, I'm totally messing this up. [Tsk] Let me start over, okay?

749 [Happy] [Fast] Wait, you're from Portland too? What are the odds—I grew up like right near Hawthorne district!

750 [Whisper] Is it just me, or is everyone here like, intimidatingly smart? [Nervous] [Laugh] I mean, I'm trying to keep up, but wow.

751 [Sarcastic] Yeah, I always wear my fanciest clothes to, um, to casual meetups. [Chuckle] Definitely didn't misread the invitation or anything.

752 [Sad] I'm usually better at this whole social thing, I swear—just having an off day, y'know? [Sigh]

753 [Shout] Oh my god, you know Sarah Chen? [Happy] [Laugh] She's literally my cousin—small world, right?

754 [Slow] So basically, what you're saying is—wait, sorry, I don't wanna put words in your mouth. [Tsk] Bad habit of mine.

755 [Fast] [Happy] I brought homemade cookies, which might be weird, but my grandma always said food breaks the ice, so... here we are!

756 [Disappointed] I thought I was early, but apparently everyone's been here for like an hour already? [Groan] Story of my life, honestly.

757 [Whisper] [Chuckle] Your boss is right behind me, isn't he? I just spent five minutes complaining about traffic and—yep, there he is.

758 [Angry] My GPS sent me to completely the wrong—whatever, I'm here now. [Fast] [Laugh] Nothing says "hire me" like showing up frazzled and sweaty, right?

759 SCENARIO: Annoyed about someone being late, then they arrive with coffee and an apology

==================================================

[annoyed]

So I'm waiting for Alex at the coffee shop, right? And they said they'd be there at ten, and it's like— it's like ten-twenty now and I'm just sitting there like an idiot with my laptop out, pretending to work but really just checking my phone every two seconds.

[frustrated]

And you know how I hate being late to things, so obviously I was there at like nine-fifty because that's just— that's what you do, right? You show up when you say you're gonna show up. It's not that hard.

[irritated] [sarcastic]

So I'm getting all worked up, like composing this whole text in my head about how this is disrespectful of my time and I have other things I could be doing, and I'm just— [sigh] I'm getting really annoyed, you know?

[surprised]

And then— oh wait, I see them through the window and they're like jogging, literally jogging toward the door with two coffees in their hands, and they burst in all out of breath and—

[softer] [slightly embarrassed]

They immediately start apologizing, like really genuinely apologizing, and they got me my favorite drink— the oat milk cortado thing I always get— without me even asking.

[warm] [a bit guilty]

Turns out their mom had called with some family emergency thing and they couldn't just hang up, you know? And they still thought to grab my coffee on the way. [small laugh] I felt like such a jerk for being so mad.
