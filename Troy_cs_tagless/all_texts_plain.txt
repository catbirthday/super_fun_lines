I—okay, yeah, I mentioned it, but I honestly thought it would help you! You've been complaining for months about not getting recognized and I just wanted to—I dunno, give you a boost.
Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're acting like I sabotaged you or something. I was literally trying to help. Marcus even seemed really interested when I brought up all the extra hours you've been putting in.
What? No no no, that's not—I specifically said you didn't know I was talking to him. [scoff] I made sure he knew this was just me looking out for you.
Okay, fine, maybe I should've asked first, but come on—you would've said no. You always say no when people try to help you with this stuff. And then you just sit there being miserable about it.
That's not—ugh, you're twisting this. I saw an opportunity at the happy hour and I took it. Sue me for actually [frustrated laugh] caring about your career apparently.
You're being dramatic. Marcus likes you—he's always liked you. I mean, yeah, maybe the timing wasn't perfect, but I really don't think it's gonna be as bad as you're making it out to be.
And you don't get to just—okay okay, I messed up the approach, fine. But you're acting like I'm some kind of enemy here when I was literally just trying to have your back.
I—yeah, okay, fair. [sigh] But also, like, having your back sometimes means pushing you when you won't push yourself. That's what friends do. Or at least that's what I thought we did for each other.
Then how? Seriously, tell me how I'm supposed to help when you won't—when you never let anyone help. I'm sorry I didn't do it perfectly, but I'm kinda tired of watching you get passed over because you're too proud to advocate for yourself.
Yeah. Yeah, it is. And maybe I crossed a line, I dunno. But don't pretend like you wouldn't have done something similar if you thought—whatever. I was trying to help. That's all.
What? That's—that's not even true. I don't know where you're getting that from, honestly. We're just friends who do stuff together, I'm not trying to compete with anyone.
Oh come on, that's not—I've been wanting to do a marathon for like, years. It had nothing to do with your 5K, I mean, those aren't even the same thing. You're reading way too much into this.
Are you serious right now? [scoff] I'm supposed to not advance my career because you got promoted first? That's—I can't believe you're actually saying this to me. We work in completely different departments!
Because I was inspired! That's what friends do—they inspire each other, they push each other to be better. I didn't realize that was like, a crime or whatever. I thought you'd be happy for me.
Look look, I get that maybe—okay, maybe sometimes I get a little carried away trying to keep up, but it's not because I'm trying to beat you or make you feel bad. I just... I dunno, I see you doing cool stuff and I wanna do cool stuff too.
Well I'm sorry you feel that way, but like—[frustrated laugh] I'm not gonna apologize for having ambitions. That's not fair. You're basically asking me to make myself smaller so you feel better.
Then what? What do you want from me? Because it sounds like—it really sounds like you want me to just... not try at things. Or only try at things you don't care about, which is kinda messed up, honestly.
I'm not—okay okay, fine. Maybe I do get a little competitive sometimes. But it's not like, malicious or anything. It's just how I'm wired, y'know? I see someone doing something and I think "I could probably do that too."
You're—you're twisting everything I say. [sigh] Yes, fine, with you too. But that doesn't mean I see our entire friendship as some kind of competition. It just means I... I dunno, I admire you and wanna push myself the way you push yourself.
That's not—ugh, okay, if that's how you wanna see it, then I guess I can't change your mind. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I'm some terrible person for wanting to achieve things. Maybe—maybe you should think about why it bothers you so much when I succeed at something.
Okay, um—yeah, I did talk to them. But it's not like I sought them out or anything. We're literally in the same friend group, what am I supposed to do, just ignore them completely?
That's—come on, that's not realistic. We were both at Mark's birthday thing, standing in the same circle and—I mean, everyone would've noticed if I just [scoff] turned my back or whatever. That would've made it worse.
I was being polite! There's a difference between being polite and—look look, I get that you're hurt, okay? But you're acting like I betrayed you when I was literally just trying not to make things weird for everyone else.
No, you know what? This whole situation where I have to pick sides in a breakup when we all hang out together—that's what's weird. And honestly? [frustrated laugh] I'm kinda tired of being put in the middle of this.
I chose to—to what, not be a complete asshole at a mutual friend's party? Yeah, guilty. But you're making it sound like I'm, I dunno, hanging out with them behind your back or something, which I'm not.
Because I'm telling you! God, when have I ever—okay okay, fine. Be like that. But I've been your friend for like six years, and if you seriously think I'd do that to you, then maybe you don't know me at all.
That's—wow. That's really unfair. You're basically asking me to be rude to someone in front of all our friends, and when I don't, suddenly I'm this terrible person? [sigh] I'm sorry you're hurting, I really am, but this isn't fair.
And gone where? It was a small apartment! Look, I kept it short, I didn't—we talked about the weather and Mark's new job, that's it. I didn't bring up anything about you or the relationship or anything like that.
I dunno what's supposed to make you feel better anymore! I'm trying here, but you're not—you're not even listening. You just wanna be mad at me, and honestly? That's starting to feel pretty shitty from my end too.
Before what? Before existing in the same space as your ex? Yeah, okay. Fine fine. But y'know what? I'm not gonna apologize for refusing to make every social situation into some big dramatic thing just because you two couldn't work it out. That's not my job.
Oh. Oh no, is this about—wait, are you talking about the meditation thing? Or the veganism? Because I wasn't trying to preach, I swear, I was just—I thought I was sharing, y'know?
That's not—okay maybe that's a little true. [nervous laugh] But like, I genuinely didn't realize I was doing it that much? I just get excited about stuff and then I can't shut up about it.
You did. You totally did and I—god, I'm such an idiot. I thought I was being helpful? Like, when you mentioned your stress, I immediately went into the whole meditation spiel and I should've just—I should've just listened.
No. No, I didn't. And then with the diet stuff too, right? When you were just trying to enjoy your lunch and I started going on about—ugh, I can see it now. [groan] I'm that person. I became that annoying person.
I'm sorry. Like, really really sorry. It's just—these things helped me so much that I wanted to share them with you because I care about you? But that's not an excuse to be pushy and I—I get that now.
I know I know, but this time—okay, that sounds bad. Um. This time I actually hear you? Like really hear you. You're not my project to fix, you're my friend who just wants to hang out without getting a lecture.
And you deserve that. God, you must've been so frustrated with me. Like every time we'd get together you're probably thinking "here we go again" and that's—that's not what friendship should be, right?
I bet. I bet it was. [sigh] Look, I'm gonna—I'm gonna work on this. Really work on it. Maybe put like a rubber band on my wrist or something to snap when I start doing it again?
Right? And you can totally call me out if I slip up. Just be like "rubber band" and I'll know to shut up immediately. I mean it—I don't wanna lose you over my big mouth.
Yes. Yes, absolutely. Just your friend who talks about normal stuff like TV shows and gossip and—and whatever you wanna talk about. I can do that. I want to do that.
[breathless] Oh my God, oh my God, we're alive! [nervous giggle] Did he seriously just throw his coffee at the wall? [voice cracking] I thought we were getting fired for sure when the projector died mid-presentation.
[whispered panic] When he started screaming about incompetence, I literally forgot how to breathe. [louder] But then YOU— [cackling] you offered him a stress ball from your purse like that would fix everything!
[exhausted sigh] Twenty years. [flat tone] He said he'd been waiting twenty years for this presentation. [hysterical laugh] We gave him Comic Sans headers and a fire hazard instead. This is how careers die.
[mock serious] At least we maintained eye contact during the meltdown. [voice shaking] Very professional of us. [burst of laughter] Even when he called us "disappointments to capitalism itself"—that was oddly poetic for pure rage.
[sudden realization] Wait, wait, did we even save the file? [panic rising] The backup is on my desktop but— [relieved exhale] Oh who cares, we're probably banned from the building anyway after today's performance.
[disbelieving whisper] Did security actually escort us out? [normal volume] Or was that just a very aggressive goodbye? [confused giggle] The guard seemed sympathetic when he handed us our visitor badges back, so that's something.
[rapid words] The conference room still smelled like burnt plastic when we left. [amazed] How is that even possible from one projector? [tired laugh] Maintenance is going to hate us forever, assuming we ever get back in.
[soft wonder] My hands finally stopped shaking. [steadier] Only took forty-five minutes and probable career suicide. [bitter laugh] Mom's going to love hearing about this at Thanksgiving. "How's work, sweetie?" "Well, funny story..."
[resigned acceptance] Tomorrow's problem. [firm] Right now, we survived the Peterson apocalypse together. [warming up] That bonds us for life, you realize? [chuckle] We're disaster sisters now. There's no going back from this.
[suddenly urgent] Oh no, the parking meter! [frantic] We've been decomposing here for an hour! [groaning laugh] A parking ticket would be the perfect end to this nightmare. The universe's final little joke today.
[professionally] I understand your frustration, sir, let me pull up your account. [apologetically] Could you please verify the last four digits of your social security number and your mother's maiden name? [calmly] These freezes are usually triggered by our security system for account protection.
[sympathetically] I see here that there were three suspicious transactions from IP address 192.168.45.209 on Tuesday. [cautiously] Someone attempted transfers totaling $8,500 to accounts in, um... [hesitant] Lagos, Nigeria. Did you authorize these?
[defensive] Sir, please lower your voice, I'm trying to help you here. [more firmly] The system shows login attempts from your registered device, MAC address 3C-7B-96-A4-22-F1. [measured tone] Were you perhaps using public WiFi or—
[sighs heavily] I need to escalate this to our fraud department, reference number FRD-2024-78453. [apologetically] They'll need 48 to 72 hours to investigate, and then— [more quietly] I know it's not what you want to hear, but—
[firmly] Sir, threatening to leave won't speed up the process. [more sternly] Your security is our priority, and these protocols exist for a reason. [sighs] However, I can issue you a temporary access code—TMP-8847-QRX—for limited withdrawals up to $500.
[resigned] My name is Sandra Mitchell, employee ID 44729, and my supervisor is Mr. Davies. [professionally] But he'll tell you the same thing—Policy 47-B clearly states frozen accounts require full investigation. [more gently] Sir, have you checked for any malware on your devices?
[sympathetically] Let me try one more thing—I'm checking alternative verification through your loan history. [hopefully] You had an auto loan, account LA-2019-6634, paid off early? [more encouragingly] This might allow me to partially lift the restriction.
[cautiously optimistic] Okay, I'm seeing green flags here, your employment with TechCorp since 2009 is verified. [typing tone] I can release up to $5,000 immediately to checking sub-account 4782-A. [reassuringly] The rest should be available within 24 hours if fraud clears it.
[confidently] I'm adding priority flag PRY-1147 to your case right now. [helpfully] Call this direct line—1-800-555-8924 extension 4429—tomorrow at 9 AM sharp. [warmly] Ask for Janet in escalations, tell her Sandra pre-authorized override code X-4-Alpha.
[understanding] No apology necessary, Mr. Thompson, I'd be upset too if my account showed $47,000 frozen. [reassuringly] Your funds are safe, we'll get this sorted. [professionally kind] Is there anything else I can help with while you're here today?
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [quickly] Let me pull up your service history right away—I see here multiple visits for engine stalling. [more reassuring] We're going to get to the bottom of this today, I promise.
[calmly] I hear you, and you're absolutely right to be upset. [more firmly] Here's what we're going to do differently—our master technician will personally inspect it, not just run diagnostics. [briskly] No charge for today's inspection, obviously.
[quickly] You're right, he should have been involved earlier—that's on us. [more apologetically] Between you and me, we've had some staffing changes that affected our process. [reassuring] But John, our senior tech, he's been here fifteen years and knows these engines inside out.
[sympathetically] Oh no, that must have been terrifying for both of you. [more determined] I can't guarantee anything until John looks at it, but [briskly] here's what I can do—we'll provide a loaner car while we work on yours, no rental fees.
[quickly] John can see it this afternoon—should have answers by five. [more confidently] If it's something we've missed before, we'll make it right, including refunding previous repairs that didn't address the real issue. [firmly] That's my manager's commitment.
[briskly] Perfect, let me get you set up with that loaner right now. [reassuring] It's a newer model actually, fully insured by us. [more personally] And Mr. Johnson, I'm giving you my direct line—any issues, you call me personally.
[seriously] We absolutely know, and we value that relationship immensely. [more urgently] That's why I'm escalating this to regional management as well—they need to know we've let you down. [quickly] This isn't just about one car anymore.
[emphatically] Not at all, that's the bare minimum you deserve. [briskly] John just freed up—he can look at it in an hour actually. [more warmly] Would you like coffee while you wait, or should I have someone drive you home?
[indignantly] Your driving style? [quickly] That's completely inappropriate—engine stalling isn't user error. [more apologetically] I'm sorry you were told that, that's not how we should handle concerns, ever.
[confidently] One hour for initial assessment, yes, and I'm your point person from now on. [briskly] I'll text you updates as John works, so you're not left wondering. [warmly] We're going to make this right, Mr. Johnson.
[Happy] So every single Thanksgiving, right, we all have to, um, wear these ridiculous pilgrim hats my grandma made in like 1982. [Laugh] They're falling apart but nobody's allowed to throw them away!
[Slow] It started when my great-grandfather came over from Italy and he—well, he couldn't afford presents, so... [Sigh] he'd hide coins in the bread.
[Whisper] Don't tell anyone but honestly? [Fast] I think half the family hates doing it but we're all too scared to be the first one to say something.
[Sarcastic] Oh yeah, nothing says "family bonding" like forcing everyone to sing that awful song Uncle Jerry wrote. [Tsk] It doesn't even rhyme properly.
We basically just, uh, throw flour at each other at midnight—I know, I know it sounds weird but [Chuckle] you should see my dad's face when he gets hit!
[Angry] Look, I've tried explaining this like fifty times already! [Groan] You gotta spin counterclockwise or grandma will literally lose her mind about it!
[Disappointed] The younger kids don't really, um, get why we do it anymore, y'know? [Slow] They just wanna play on their phones instead.
[Fast] Wait wait wait, I forgot the most important part—you absolutely cannot, and I mean cannot, eat anything until the bell rings three times! [Shout] Three times!
My mom insists we all have to share our—actually, it's kinda embarrassing but [Sad] we share our biggest failure of the year first. [Sigh]
[Happy] Every New Year's Eve we burn these little paper wishes and the smoke is supposed to—oh man, last year mine caught the curtains on fire! [Laugh] [Fast] Dad was so mad!
You're gonna think this is strange but, er, we bury a jar of pennies in the backyard every summer solstice? [Whisper] Nobody remembers why anymore. [Chuckle]
[Slow] The thing about our Sunday dinners is that whoever arrives last has to... [Disappointed] well, they become the designated storyteller for the entire meal. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Sure, let's all pretend that watching the same movie every Christmas Eve is "magical" and not just because Dad doesn't know how to work Netflix. [Groan]
Okay so basically when someone turns sixteen in our family they gotta—no wait, first they blindfold you, then—[Fast] actually it's easier if I just show you the video. [Laugh]
[Angry] I mean, why does it always have to be me who explains this to people?! [Sad] Everyone else just assumes outsiders automatically understand our weird pickle ceremony!
The birthday person isn't allowed to, um, touch their cake until everyone else takes a bite first—[Whisper] supposedly it brings good luck but I dunno. [Sigh]
[Happy] Oh, you're gonna love this part—we all wear our clothes inside out on the first day of spring! [Chuckle] The neighbors think we're absolutely insane!
[Slow] It's not really about the tradition itself, I guess, it's more about—[Disappointed] well, it's the only time everyone actually shows up anymore.
We've been doing this since before I was born and honestly? [Sarcastic] Nobody can agree on the actual rules so we just kinda make it up as we go. [Tsk] [Fast] Very official family tradition right there.
[Shout] No no no, you're holding it wrong! [Happy] Here, let me—sorry, I get weirdly intense about the proper way to pass the ceremonial spoon. [Laugh]
I know, I know I did, but—look, my mom literally called me crying. What was I supposed to do, just ignore that? I mean, come on, you know I wouldn't bail unless it was something serious.
I—okay, yeah, I should've texted sooner. But honestly, I was kinda dealing with a family emergency here? [Sigh] Like, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I just decided to blow you off for fun.
That's not—that's not fair though. You know me better than that. I've never, and I mean never, broken a promise to you before this, so maybe—I dunno—maybe cut me some slack here?
Oh, so this is about you being embarrassed? Not about—okay, fine. [Frustrated laugh] I'm sorry everyone asked questions, but my mom was having a literal breakdown, so excuse me for prioritizing that.
I'm not! I'm just—look look, I'm trying to explain that sometimes things happen that are outta my control, y'know? And yeah, I shoulda handled it better, but you're not even letting me explain properly.
Because my mom needed me! God, you're being so—whatever. Fine. I messed up. Is that what you wanna hear? But I'm not gonna apologize for putting my family first when there was an actual crisis.
And I get that, I really do. But like—life happens sometimes? I didn't plan for this. I wanted to be there, honestly I did, but I literally couldn't. [Scoff] And you standing there all cold and angry isn't exactly helping anything.
Yeah, and promises are important, but they're not—they're not more important than emergencies. I mean, if your dad had a heart attack, would you still show up to my thing? Seriously?
How? How is it different? My mom was—she was falling apart, okay? And maybe I didn't handle the communication perfectly, but I was kinda busy trying to keep my family together, so...
That's it? Just "fine"? Look, I'm—I'm sorry I let you down, okay? I am. But I'm also really disappointed that you can't see past your own hurt here to understand that I was in an impossible situation.
Wait wait wait—you went up? You actually did it? Oh my god, I'm like—I'm literally so proud of you right now! How did it go?
They—hold on, they laughed? Like actually laughed? Not just polite chuckles but like, real laughs? [Gasp] Dude, that's incredible!
Stop it—the one where she, um, where she thinks salt is a vegetable? That's—oh my god, I knew that would kill! You were so nervous about that one!
Mid-set applause? That's like—okay that's basically unheard of for open mics. Were there any, y'know, any comics there? Like established ones?
No no no, you're—you're kidding me. The actual headliner watched your set? That's huge! What did they—did they say anything after? [Excited] Please tell me they said something!
Natural timing is like—that's literally the thing you can't teach! Oh my god, I'm getting secondhand adrenaline just hearing this. Are you gonna do it again?
Already—wait, you already booked another one? Look at you! [Laugh] Remember when you were like "I'll probably bomb and never do this again"?
No but seriously, this is—I mean, you've been writing jokes in that notebook for what, like two years? And you finally got up there and just... killed it.
It felt good? Okay okay, that's—that's the most emotion I've heard from you in months! You're gonna be one of those comics, aren't you? The ones who like, can't stop once they start?
We'll see, they say, like they're not already planning their [Chuckle] Netflix special. I'm so—honestly? I'm just really happy for you. This is your thing, I can feel it.
Comments? What—oh. Oh no. Is this about earlier? Because I didn't mean—I was just trying to be helpful, you know? Like supportive or whatever.
Okay, that came out wrong. Really wrong. I just meant like—when I said that thing about your jeans, I wasn't trying to [nervous laugh] god, this sounds terrible now that I'm saying it out loud.
Wait wait wait, there's more? Oh god, what else did I—actually, no, you're right. I know I've been... I've been doing this a lot lately, haven't I? The gym comment last week and the—the salad thing.
Shit. Shit, I'm—I'm that person. I'm literally that person who can't shut up about—god, I'm so sorry. My mom does this to me and I hate it and now I'm doing it to you [groan] I'm the worst.
I deserve that. I do. It's just—okay this isn't an excuse but my sister just started this whole fitness thing and she keeps talking about it and I guess I just internalized all that toxic—that's not your problem though. That's my problem.
No no no, of course not. That's not—I wasn't gonna—look, I genuinely didn't realize how much I was doing it until right now. Like hearing you list it all out? I wanna crawl into a hole and die.
That's not—oh my god, of course you do. Of course. I'm not trying to—I don't think you need to change or anything. Honestly, I think I was projecting my own weird issues and that's so unfair to you.
I know. Or—actually I don't know, but I can imagine and I'm... I'm really, really sorry. Like genuinely sorry, not just saying-it-to-make-this-stop sorry. I had no idea I was hurting you like that. [quieter] I should've known though.
Oh. That's—wow. Okay. That really... yeah. I get it though. I do. Can we—is there a way to fix this? Because I swear I will never, ever comment on your body or your food or anything like that again. Ever.
I do mean it. I promise I do. And if I slip up—which I won't, but if I do—you can call me out immediately. Like, just tell me to shut up. I want you to. Because your friendship means way more to me than whatever stupid thing I might wanna say about... anything.
[devastated] My life is completely over! [voice breaking] The coffee shop ran out of oat milk, and I had to use regular milk in my latte. [wailing] How am I supposed to function today with dairy destroying my entire digestive system?
[dramatically gasping] That was different! [whimpering] Pizza cheese doesn't count because it's... it's comfort food! [building hysteria] But coffee is sacred, and now my whole morning routine is ruined forever and I'll probably die!
[trembling whisper] You don't understand the psychological damage! [getting louder] I specifically chose that coffee shop because they respect dietary preferences! [shouting] This betrayal cuts deeper than when Jennifer stole my parking spot last Tuesday!
[defensive shriek] Details! [quieter, sulking] The point is that everything is against me today. [building drama again] First the milk catastrophe, then I broke a nail, and now you're being completely heartless about my suffering!
[sobbing dramatically] See? [hiccupping] This is exactly why I can't share my feelings with you! [accusatory] When YOUR favorite pen ran out of ink, I was there for you! I listened! I cared!
[wounded gasp] How can you put a price on emotional trauma? [pleading] My grandmother gave me these nails! [softer, manipulative] Well, she gave me the DNA that grows them, which is basically the same thing!
[indignant squeal] They're gel, not acrylic! [huffing] And it was twenty dollars! [dejected moan] But fine, minimize my pain. When I'm hospitalized for calcium deficiency from avoiding dairy forever, don't come visit me!
[mysteriously] You know what? [building suspense] I might be! [dramatic revelation] Maybe I'm developing multiple food sensitivities because of the stress you're causing me right now with your complete lack of empathy!
[fake cheerful] Fine! [bitterly] I'll just suffer alone! [melodramatic whisper] Like I always do, carrying the weight of this cruel, dairy-filled world on my lactose-intolerant shoulders while everyone else lives in ignorant bliss!
[immediately sympathetic] Oh my god, your rent went up? [excited squeal] Why didn't you say something? [rapidly] We should totally move in together and split the cost! Think of all the money we'd save!
[mysteriously] I need to understand your... membership structures. [pause] The basic tier at $60 annually versus the, um, Executive at $120—[whispers] what hidden benefits exist beyond the posted signage?
[contemplatively] Two percent... interesting. [suddenly intense] If someone were to spend, say, $6,000 annually on—[clears throat] let's call them "bulk provisions"—the mathematics become quite favorable, don't they?
[cryptically] Tires, yes... vehicles need those. [more directly] Tell me about the pharmacy benefits under policy PH-2024-EX. [quietly] Are prescription records kept... separately from main membership databases?
[satisfied] Precisely what I meant. [abruptly] Business memberships—code BUS-500X—can those be registered to, shall we say, [pause] entities with offshore addresses like Box 4472, Grand Cayman?
[intrigued] Sixteen additional humans, fascinating redundancy. [calculating] If hypothetically someone needed to purchase 500 pounds of—[coughs]—protein powder monthly, would that trigger any... [whispers darkly] algorithmic concerns in your inventory system INV-TRACK-7?
[thoughtfully] Loading dock 7-B... noted for future reference. [urgently] One final query—member data from terminated accounts, policy TERM-POL-2024, [lower voice] how long before complete purging from servers located at 1599 Data Center Drive?
[pleased] Cash transactions, the elegant simplicity of analog commerce. [decisively] I'll take the Executive membership, paying in sequential hundreds. [mysteriously soft] Please register it under the name "A. Individual"—[chuckles] first initial A, period, last name Individual.
[smoothly] Excellent, here's a passport from—[pause] never mind which nation. [quickly] Send everything to P.O. Box 1138, Station Alpha, zip code 00501. [satisfied sigh] This concludes our illuminating exchange about membership benefits, doesn't it?
[amused] Roadside assistance for protein transport emergencies, how... thoughtful. [formally] You've been most informative, employee badge number—[squints] —4472. [whispers] I may return during your shift pattern, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10am to 6pm.
[cryptically] Hot dogs... processed meat of mysterious origin, yes. [standing to leave] Until we meet again—[pause] though you won't remember this conversation. [softer] Check your pocket later for a tip that's distinctly... non-digital.
[professionally] Good afternoon, Pest Shield Services, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today? I see you're calling from—oh yes, the Johnson residence on Maple Street.
[apologetically] Oh no, I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Mrs. Johnson. [more reassuringly] Our treatment comes with a thirty-day guarantee, so we'll absolutely send someone back. [briskly] Let me just pull up your file here... when works best for you?
[sympathetically] I completely understand the urgency. [more quickly] Let me check our schedule—we have... actually, Tom can squeeze you in between three and five today. [confidently] He's our senior technician, specializes in persistent ant colonies.
[thoughtfully] Sometimes ants switch their food preferences seasonally—protein versus sugar. [more animated] Tom will bring our full arsenal this time, different gel baits, granules, the works. [reassuringly] We'll identify the species and hit them with exactly what they're craving.
[quickly] Absolutely no additional charges, it's all covered under your initial service warranty. [more emphatically] Tom will also do a full perimeter check—sometimes we find new entry points that weren't visible before. [professionally] Would you like him to call when he's on his way?
[sympathetically] Oh, that's so frustrating, losing food on top of everything else. [briskly] I'm making detailed notes for Tom right now—kitchen priority, check pantry area thoroughly. [reassuringly] He'll also leave extra bait stations in problem zones, no charge.
[confidently] Absolutely, and that's exactly why we're sending Tom. [enthusiastically] He's been with us twelve years, has this methodical approach—checks everything from foundation cracks to, [chuckles] even dishwasher connections. Really thorough guy.
[helpfully] Just clear under the sink if you can, give Tom access to baseboards. [more casually] Don't worry about deep cleaning—actually, leaving a few ants visible helps him track their trails. [quickly] Oh, and pet bowls should be picked up during treatment.
[apologetically] I'm really sorry you were given that impression. [more honestly] Sometimes it does take one visit, but persistent colonies, especially in spring—they can be tricky. [briskly] I'm also adding a note for Tom to inspect neighboring units for source colonies.
[reassuringly] He definitely will, and if it is from neighboring property, we can coordinate treatment. [quickly] I've scheduled you for three to five, Tom Rodriguez will call thirty minutes before arrival. [helpfully] Is this still the best number to reach you?
[Fast] Okay so, like, I was in my childhood home but it wasn't—it had extra rooms that kept appearing, you know? [Confused] [Laugh]
[Whisper] And my teeth started falling out, one by one, into my hands like, um, like little pearls or something. [Slow] [Tsk]
[Happy] The weirdest part? I could fly but only, uh, only backwards! [Chuckle] Just zooming through clouds in reverse!
[Sarcastic] Oh, and naturally my boss was there dressed as a giant lobster, because that's totally normal, right? [Groan]
[Slow] Everything was kinda... underwater but I could still breathe somehow? [Sigh] I dunno, it felt completely natural at the time.
[Angry] I kept trying to scream but—but nothing would come out! [Fast] Just this horrible silence while everyone stared at me!
[Disappointed] My phone wouldn't work properly, like, the numbers kept changing and I couldn't—I just couldn't call anyone for help. [Tsk] [Sad]
You were there too, but you had, um, your face was all wrong somehow? [Slow] [Whisper]
[Shout] Then suddenly I'm at my wedding but I'm wearing pajamas! [Laugh] [Fast] Everyone's just acting like it's totally fine!
[Sad] My grandma showed up, which was—I mean, she passed away years ago, but there she was, y'know? [Sigh] [Slow]
[Happy] I won the lottery but the money was all, like, Monopoly money and I didn't even care! [Chuckle] Just stuffing it in my pockets!
[Fast] Wait wait wait, I forgot the part where my cat could talk—actually, all animals could talk and they were really judgmental! [Groan]
[Disappointed] I kept trying to run but my legs were like—ugh, like moving through molasses or something. [Angry] So frustrating!
[Whisper] There was this door that I knew I shouldn't open, but I had to—I just had to see what was behind it. [Tsk] [Slow]
[Sarcastic] And of course I showed up to take an exam I'd never studied for, because my subconscious is super original like that. [Sigh]
Honestly, the sky was, um, purple with green stars and nobody seemed to—to even notice anything was off? [Slow] [Disappointed]
[Shout] I turned into a bird mid-conversation! [Laugh] [Happy] Just literally sprouted wings and took off while talking to my mother!
[Sad] I was lost in this endless hallway and every door led to—to the same empty room over and over. [Whisper] [Sigh]
[Fast] My reflection didn't match what I was doing, like it had its own—its own agenda or whatever, super creepy! [Angry] [Tsk]
[Chuckle] The whole thing ended when I realized I was dreaming, and then I tried to—to stay asleep but couldn't! [Disappointed] Typical, right?
I know, I know how long you were—look, I wanted to come, okay? I did. But hospitals are just... [exhale] they're really hard for me. Like, really hard.
Don't—don't do that. Don't just say "right" like that. You know about my anxiety, I've told you about the whole thing with my mom and—I mean, I literally can't even drive past one without feeling like I'm gonna throw up.
That's not—okay okay, that's not fair. Everyone else doesn't have panic attacks in medical settings. I texted you every day, I sent food, I called—I was trying to be there in the ways I could, y'know?
No, it's not the same, you're right. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I just... forgot about you or something. [scoff] Like I was just hanging out, having a great time while you were there.
Are you serious right now? I was—I was literally worried sick about you the entire time. I couldn't sleep, I was checking my phone constantly for updates, I was—honestly, this is really unfair.
And I needed to not have a complete breakdown in your hospital room! That's—that would've made everything worse, wouldn't it? Me hyperventilating while you're trying to recover?
I did try! I got—I got all the way to the parking garage twice. Twice. And both times I just... I couldn't. [frustrated laugh] But sure, yeah, I guess that doesn't count as trying.
Wow. Okay. So basically nothing I did matters because I couldn't physically be in that room. The daily check-ins, the—the care packages, asking your sister for updates every few hours, none of that counts.
Oh, come on, don't—don't do the past tense thing. Look look, I'm sorry I couldn't be there the way you wanted. I am. But I was drowning in my own stuff and trying—trying really hard to support you anyway.
That's... [sigh] okay, I get that you're hurt. I do. And maybe—maybe I should've pushed through it somehow, I dunno. But I'm also disappointed that after everything, you can't see that I was doing my best. Even if my best wasn't enough.
Wait wait wait—what went through? Are you talking about the—oh my god, the patent? Did you actually get the patent?!
Are you—holy shit, are you serious right now? That's like... that's literally life-changing! I mean, you've been working on this for what, three years? [Gasp] Oh my god, we gotta celebrate!
Three and a—okay but like, do you realize how huge this is? You're gonna be like, an actual inventor now. Like officially. With paperwork and everything!
Weird? Babe, no no no, this is—I mean, okay yeah, I get it must be kinda surreal but like... you did this. You actually pulled it off, y'know?
Oh man, they're gonna—wait, are you nervous about telling them? Because honestly, after all that crap they said about you wasting time in the garage? [Chuckle] This is gonna be so good.
Okay but—but it could be, right? Like, now that it's patented you can actually, I dunno, sell it or license it or whatever inventors do?
There's—hold up, there's already interest? And you're just casually mentioning this now like it's nothing? [Laugh] You're literally the worst at sharing good news, you know that?
No no, I totally get that, but like—can you at least tell me which companies? Are we talking big ones or like, startups or what?
The—oh my god, you mean like, the fancy ones everyone has? That's... okay that's actually insane. How are you being so calm about this right now?
Yeah, no, I can—I can actually see your hand shaking a little bit. [Softer] Hey, this is gonna change everything for you, huh? Like, in the best way possible.
Oh god—okay, I was gonna tell you, I swear I was gonna tell you. It just—it happened so fast and I didn't know how to bring it up, y'know?
Um, like two weeks? Maybe three? But wait wait wait—before you get mad, we didn't plan it or anything. We just ran into each other at that party and—actually no, that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] Let me start over.
No no no, not lying! I just—I hadn't found the right time to tell you. Which I realize now was stupid because there's literally never gonna be a right time for "hey I'm hooking up with your ex," right?
I did. I mean, of course I did, that's why I—god, I'm such an idiot. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal because you guys have been broken up for like six months, but that's not—that doesn't make it okay. [sigh] I know that.
You're right, you're totally right. And honestly? I wasn't even thinking about—okay that's a lie, I was definitely thinking about how you'd react. I just kinda... convinced myself you wouldn't care as much as you obviously do.
I don't—I dunno, it just happened? We were both drunk and talking about work stuff and then suddenly we were—um. Yeah. But then we kept texting and it turned into this whole thing that I never expected.
What? No! God no, I would never—this was never about you. I mean, obviously it affects you, but I didn't do this to hurt you. I actually really do like them. Like, a lot. Which makes this so much worse because I want to be happy but I also just completely betrayed my best friend and I—[groan] I'm handling this so badly.
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I should've—the second I realized there was something between us, I should've come to you. That would've been the right thing to do, y'know? Instead of being a coward about it.
Yeah, no, totally. Take all the time you need. I just—can we eventually talk about this? Like actually talk? Because I can't lose you over this. You're literally one of the most important people in my life and if I have to choose—
Okay. Yeah, okay. I'll—I'll wait. And again, I'm so sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything but... I really am sorry.
That's not—okay, that's not what happened. I wasn't pretending not to know you, I just... I didn't know how to introduce you to my boss and everyone. It was awkward.
Look look, I know how it seemed, but you literally showed up out of nowhere and I was in the middle of this whole—they were talking about promotions. [frustrated laugh] I panicked, okay?
I didn't walk past—I mean, I kinda did, but I was gonna circle back. You're acting like I planned this whole thing to humiliate you or something.
Come on, that's—you know that's not fair. These people, they're... they're different, okay? They judge everything. Who you know, where you hang out, literally everything matters with them. I'm not saying I handled it right, but [sigh] you don't get what it's like.
No! God, no, that's not what I'm—why are you twisting this? You're not embarrassing, the situation was just... complicated. I didn't wanna explain our whole history to them right there.
Yeah, and those ten years mean something to me too, obviously. But you're not—look, you're not being fair either. You show up at my work thing wearing that shirt with all the holes and—okay okay, that came out wrong.
That's not what I meant and you know it. I just—these work people, they're judgmental assholes, honestly. And I'm trying to get promoted, and I didn't know how to... [groan] merge those two worlds right then.
You're right. You're right, I should've—I dunno, done something. But I froze, okay? And now you're acting like I'm this terrible person when really I just... I messed up. Can't we just—
Move past this? I mean, seriously, one awkward moment and you're ready to throw away everything? That's kinda harsh, don't you think?
And I'm sorry about—no, actually? I'm sorry-ish. Because yeah, I handled it badly, but you could also try to understand that my job is... it's complicated. And maybe—maybe you coulda just let it go instead of making this whole thing into some huge betrayal.
I know, I know, I'm—look, I tried to make it work, okay? I really did. But then Jamie needed help moving and I'd already promised weeks ago, and I thought I could do both but—
That's not—okay, that's kinda true, but it's not like I'm trying to let you down. I just... I dunno, people need things and I wanna help. Is that really so terrible?
Come on, that's—you're being dramatic. It's not always you. [Sigh] And honestly? Sometimes it feels like you expect me to drop everything for you when I've got like, a million other commitments I made first.
Oh, okay, so I should just—what, tell everyone no? That's your solution? Look look, I get that you're mad, but you don't understand how hard it is when people are literally counting on me.
And I'm sorry about that, I am, but—[frustrated laugh]—you're acting like I do this to hurt you on purpose. Like I wake up thinking "how can I disappoint my friend today?" That's not what happens.
That's—wow. That's really unfair. I don't forget you exist, I just... sometimes I overestimate what I can handle, okay? And yeah yeah, maybe I should say no more, but it's not that simple.
No, it's not! You don't—ugh, you don't get it. When someone's like, desperate for help, I can't just be like "sorry, no." That's not who I am. And honestly? I thought you'd understand that about me by now.
Strangers? Seriously? Jamie's not a stranger, they're—whatever. You know what? I'm trying to explain myself here and you're just... you're not even listening. You've already decided I'm the worst friend ever.
I'm—[scoff] how am I supposed to prove anything when you're like this? I messed up, fine, but I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I'm some terrible person because I tried to help too many people at once.
That's not what I—you know what? Fine. Be mad. But maybe, just maybe, consider that I'm drowning here too, trying to keep everyone happy, and yeah, I failed today. But at least I'm trying.
Wait wait wait—what? You graduated? Like, officially done done? Oh my god, why didn't you—I mean, this is huge! Years of night school and you're just casually mentioning it now?
I'm literally—okay, I'm getting emotional here because like, do you even realize how insane this is? Working full-time and then dragging yourself to class until what, ten at night? [Laugh] You're basically superhuman.
Oh no no no, don't do that. Don't minimize this. You passed—that's what matters. God, remember when you were like, studying in your car during lunch breaks? That was—I mean, I honestly don't know how you didn't lose it.
That professor, right? The one who—ugh, what was his name? Actually, y'know what, doesn't matter. He's in your rearview now. [Sigh] How does it feel though? Like, really?
Oh that's so—okay that's weirdly sad but also kinda funny? Like your brain hasn't caught up yet. What're you gonna do with all your Tuesday nights now?
TV! Actual leisure time! Revolutionary concept, honestly. But like—okay, real talk, are you proud of yourself? Because you should be. You really, really should be.
A month, okay okay, I'll—I'll give you that. But um, we're celebrating, right? Like, this isn't negotiable. I'm thinking dinner, drinks, the whole thing.
[Gasp] Stop it—that's adorable! She's probably been waiting for this longer than you have. Let her have her moment, y'know? She watched you struggle through all of it.
Small, got it. But I'm definitely making a speech. Don't even—don't look at me like that, I'm gonna cry and everything. It'll be embarrassing for both of us, it's gonna be great.
Too late, already writing it in my head. Something about perseverance and—oh! Remember that time you literally fell asleep standing up at my birthday? [Chuckle] Yeah, that's going in there for sure.
SCENARIO: trying to remember the word that's on the tip of their tongue
[breathlessly] Oh my God, is that what I think it is?! [voice rising] Let me see your hand—no, wait, is this real? [Squeals] This is actually happening right now, and I can't believe you didn't tell me immediately!
[shouting] The botanical gardens! [voice cracking] That's so perfect I could cry—actually, I am crying! [Gasps] Look at the size of that diamond! How did you keep this secret for an entire night without exploding?
[shakily] We have to plan everything! [speaking rapidly] The dress, the venue, the flowers—oh my God, I'm going to be your maid of honor, right? [pleading tone] Please say yes or I'll literally die on this kitchen floor.
[dreamily] Remember our wedding binders? [Laughs] They're still in Mom's attic with all those magazine clippings. [more excitedly] We thought we'd marry princes who'd arrive on white horses, not Dave from accounting with his Toyota!
[quietly awed] I'm so happy for you. [voice swelling] You deserve every single beautiful moment of this. [Shaky breath] When you walk down that aisle, I promise I'll try not to sob louder than the music plays.
[trembling] Is that—is that really you? [voice breaking] I thought everyone was gone, I thought I was the only one left! [Sobbing gasp] Please tell me this isn't another hallucination from the radiation.
[quivering] Your face, you're so thin. [more urgently] How long since you've eaten? [Shaky breath] I have some canned peaches in my pack, they're from before everything went dark.
[fierce whisper] Don't talk like that. [stronger] We're alive, we found each other against impossible odds! [Gasping cry] That has to mean something, that has to mean we're supposed to survive this nightmare.
[frantically] We need to move north before the second wave hits. [steadier] There's a group gathering supplies near the old hospital. [soft sob] They have medicine, clean water—things we only dreamed about finding.
[pleading] Because I've already been there, they took in children! [voice rising] Children who lost everything, just like us. [Whimpering] Please, just trust me one more time, like you used to before the world ended.
[nostalgic whisper] Remember that camping trip where we got lost for six hours? [laughing through tears] You said we'd never survive the wilderness. [Snorting] Look at us now, actual apocalypse survivors finding each other.
[determined] Hey, no more hell talk, okay? [gentler] We're going to make it through this because we have each other now. [Shaky inhale] Two people means shared watch duties, shared hope, shared tomorrow.
[urgent whisper] Wait, do you hear that? [more anxiously] There's movement in the building behind you—we should go now. [Panicked breath] Grab my hand and don't let go no matter what happens next.
[commanding] It's just debris falling, breathe! [soothing] The infected don't come out until dusk, we have time. [Relieved sigh] See? Just the wind knocking things over, like it always does now.
[tender] Those speeches kept me going too, even when I was alone. [firm resolve] We're writing a new one together now. [Tearful smile in voice] Chapter one: two friends refuse to let the world end.
[nervously] Hi, um, I'm calling about setting up a wallet? [clears throat] I've been trying to, to figure this out for like three hours now, and [frustrated sigh] nothing makes sense on your website.
[shuffling] Oh, yeah, it's K7-4923-881. [pause] Wait, no, sorry—[embarrassed] that's 882 at the end, not 881.
[confused] I don't—what's the difference? [increasingly worried] Someone on Reddit said I need a seed phrase with like 24 words? [exhales sharply] Is that the cold one?
[overwhelmed] Okay, okay, so if I want to move my, um, 0.043 Bitcoin—[hesitant] is that even enough to worry about? [self-deprecating chuckle] I bought it at $47,000, so...
[frantically] Let me check—yeah, it's 839-264. [suspicious] Wait, this is legitimate right? [nervous laugh] You're not one of those scammers?
[relieved] Oh good, good. [muttering] Let me write this down... bc1q... [confused again] How many characters is this thing supposed to be?
[frustrated groan] This is so complicated! [pleading] Can't you just, I don't know, send it to my email at jchen.crypto@gmail—[catches himself] wait, that's probably not secure, is it?
[sighs deeply] Alright, so after I get this bc1q address thing, [tentatively] I can finally move my coins off your exchange? [hopefully] And they'll be safe in my own wallet?
[shocked] Wait, that's like—[calculating] six dollars just to move it? [disappointed] Man, I remember when fees were like fifty cents back in 2017.
[resigned] Fine, I'll try Sunday then. [muttering] My wife's gonna kill me when she finds out I'm waking up at 3 AM for crypto. [nervous chuckle] Thanks for your help though, really.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration with this situation. [speaking quickly] Let me pull up your account right away and see what's causing the delay. [reassuring] Can you provide me your student ID number?
[briskly] Okay, I see here that your FAFSA was received but there's a verification hold. [more quickly] Did you submit your tax documents and the, um, the verification worksheet we sent on January 15th?
[calmly] No, no, you won't lose your classes. [speaking rapidly] We can do an emergency deferment today to protect your enrollment while we sort this out. [more gently] The worksheet was sent to your school email—do you check that regularly?
[professionally] I understand the confusion, and you're right, it's not ideal. [quickly] Let me just—okay, I'm sending that worksheet to your personal email right now. [more urgently] Can you fill it out and upload it today?
[sympathetically] Unfortunately, federal regulations require this verification for about thirty percent of students. [speaking briskly] But here's what I can do—I'll extend the deferment deadline to Friday, giving you time to gather everything. [reassuringly] Would that help?
[quickly] Once we receive your documents, processing typically takes 3-5 business days. [more specifically] So if you submit Friday, you're looking at the following Wednesday or Thursday. [helpfully] We can also set up a payment plan for any immediate needs.
[confidently] Once you're verified this time, you're good for the entire academic year. [speaking rapidly] I'm also putting a note in your file to flag you for priority processing next year. [brightly] That should prevent future delays.
[earnestly] No, it's definitely real—it puts you in a faster queue. [more seriously] Look, I know we've dropped the ball here, and I'm genuinely sorry about that. [quickly] Is there anything else I can help with today?
[reassuringly] The deferment is already applied—you should see it in your portal within the hour. [speaking briskly] I've also sent you my direct extension, so call me personally if there are any issues. [warmly] We'll get this sorted out.
[kindly] No apology needed—I'd be frustrated too. [quickly] Just remember to check that school email going forward, and get those documents in by Friday. [cheerfully] You're all set for now, and good luck with your classes tomorrow!
[Disappointed] I mean, honestly, why am I always the one who has to, like, remember where we parked? [Sigh] It's exhausting.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just—let me handle everything while you guys have fun. [Tsk] That's totally fair, right?
[Fast] Okay so we gotta leave in ten minutes, everybody needs their IDs, and I already called the Uber—wait, where's Marcus? [Groan]
[Happy] You know what? I actually kinda like being the mom friend sometimes. [Laugh] Someone's gotta keep you idiots alive!
[Whisper] They're all passed out and I'm just sitting here making sure nobody, um, chokes on their own vomit or whatever. [Slow] This is my Friday night.
[Angry] I'm not your personal assistant, okay? [Shout] Figure out your own damn ride home for once!
[Sad] Sometimes I just wanna be the messy one, y'know? Like, just once let me be the disaster. [Sigh]
[Slow] Every single time we go out, it's me who ends up—actually, forget it. [Disappointed] [Tsk] You wouldn't understand anyway.
[Fast] [Happy] Wait wait wait, I brought extra phone chargers for everyone! [Chuckle] See? This is why you need me!
[Sarcastic] Nobody ever asks if I wanna do shots, but everyone suddenly knows my name when they need a designated driver. [Disappointed] Funny how that works, huh?
[Angry] I literally sent fifteen reminders about this deadline and you're just now—are you seriously just now starting? [Groan] Unbelievable.
[Whisper] [Sad] I'm so tired of being the only adult in the room, but I can't just... I can't stop, can I?
[Chuckle] You guys would basically die without me and we all know it. [Happy] [Fast] Remember last week when nobody brought water to the hike?
[Slow] [Disappointed] I guess I'll just, um, cancel my plans again to deal with your emergency. [Sigh] Third time this month.
[Shout] How do none of you have the venue address? [Angry] [Fast] The event is literally starting and I'm the only one who knows where we're going!
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh no, please, don't worry about paying me back for those tickets I bought six months ago. [Tsk] I love being everyone's personal bank.
[Happy] Actually, being the responsible one means I get to pick the restaurant every time 'cause nobody else makes reservations! [Laugh] [Fast] Silver lining, right?
[Sad] Do you guys even notice when I'm not—when I don't show up? [Whisper] Or am I just, like, the human calendar app to you?
[Disappointed] I'm twenty-three years old and I'm literally making grocery lists for grown adults who can't feed themselves. [Groan] [Slow] This isn't what I signed up for.
[Fast] [Angry] Nobody brought sunscreen, nobody checked the weather, and somehow—somehow I'm the buzzkill for pointing this out? [Sarcastic] Yeah, okay, that makes total sense!
SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a thing they assumed was covered by insurance, then checking the policy, then finding it's explicitly not covered, ending in insurance gap panic
I know, I know! I'm so sorry, I just—something came up and I couldn't—okay that sounds terrible. Let me explain, please?
No no no, listen, it's not like that! My mom called and she needed me to drive her to the hospital—wait, that makes it sound worse than it was. She's fine! But her car broke down and she had an appointment and I just... I completely blanked on the moving thing. [nervous laugh] I should've texted you.
I know. God, I know, okay? I literally feel like the worst friend ever right now. You were counting on me and I just—I totally bailed. That's not... that's not who I wanna be, y'know?
Oh my god. Four flights? Jesus, I'm—I'm such an asshole. [groan] You must've been exhausted. I mean, I can't even imagine... actually wait, did you at least get someone else to help or was it really just you?
Okay I deserve that. I totally deserve that. But like, honestly? I'm gonna make this up to you. Whatever you need—unpacking, organizing, I'll buy you pizza for a month, I don't care. Just... please don't hate me forever?
You sure? Because you seem pretty—I mean, you have every right to be pissed. I would be too if someone flaked on me like that.
Can I—would it be okay if I came over now? I could bring dinner and help you unpack? Or just... sit there while you yell at me some more. Whatever you need, honestly. [sigh] I just really wanna fix this.
No, but I've got that heating pad you like? And um, those muscle relaxer things from when I threw out my shoulder? Plus I make a mean massage—wait, that's weird. I meant like, I could help with the heavy boxes that are left or whatever.
Yeah! The fancy one with like, all the settings and stuff. And I'll grab takeout from that Thai place you love—the one with the crazy spicy pad thai that basically destroys my mouth but you somehow eat like it's nothing?
Obviously! Oh thank god, yes, absolutely I'm paying. And next time you move—which hopefully isn't for like, a really long time—I'm gonna be there super early with coffee and donuts and like, an actual truck. I promise. No more flaking.
Oh god. Oh no no no. I was gonna—I wanted to tell you in person, I swear. This isn't how you were supposed to find out.
I know how it looks but it wasn't—we didn't really invite anyone? It was super small, like literally just family and—okay that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] I'm making this worse.
I know! God, I know, and that's why this is so—I mean, you gotta understand, Marcus's parents basically hijacked the whole thing? They wanted this tiny ceremony and we just... we went along with it.
No wait wait, please don't do the one-word thing. I can't—I need you to know that I wanted you there. Like, desperately wanted you there. I actually argued about it for weeks. [sigh]
That's... yeah. That's fair. I should've fought harder, I should've just—I dunno, insisted? But his mom was crying and talking about tradition and intimate family moments and I just... I caved. I'm weak, okay? I'm admitting it.
You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm literally the worst friend. I kept meaning to call but then it felt like the longer I waited the worse it got? And then suddenly it was happening and—that's not an excuse. There's no excuse.
I know. [groan] God, I know you would've and that makes it worse somehow? Like you're—you're literally being more understanding right now than I deserve and I just... I panicked. I always panic with confrontation, you know that about me.
I'm so sorry. Like, from the bottom of my heart, I'm so—we're actually planning a bigger reception thing next month? For all our friends? And you're obviously—I mean, if you even wanna come now—you're the first person on that list.
I know it's not the same. It's not. But maybe we could—I dunno, maybe you could do a speech? Or—wait, that's probably insulting to even suggest. I just... I really wanna make this right somehow.
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. And I'm—I'm just really, really sorry. You deserved so much better from me. As a friend, I mean. You deserved better.
SCENARIO: discovering the restaurant they walked to is closed
[Wild laughter] Their golden armor couldn't save them! [panting heavily] Did you see Marcus's face when my blade found its mark? [quieter] The crowd chants our names now, not theirs—we are legends born today!
[Hushed awe] Look at them flee the arena. [mocking tone] The "invincible" Praetorian Guard, running like children! [Bellowing laugh] My mother always said I'd amount to nothing—if only she could witness her son's glory now!
[Whispered excitement] The emperor's jaw clenched when you broke Titus's shield. [growing louder] His precious champion, trained since birth, defeated by arena dogs! [Cackling] We've shattered more than bones—we've broken the myth of their superiority forever!
[Trembling with emotion] Brother, we've survived the impossible. [more firmly] A hundred men have died where we stand victorious. [Sobbing laugh] The gods themselves must have guided our blades through that massacre of steel and fury!
[Fierce whisper] Tomorrow they'll offer us anything—gold, women, land beyond imagination. [normal volume] But tonight, we stand as brothers forged in combat's furnace. [Roaring] Nothing can break the bond of warriors who've tasted death together!
[Quick and excited] Did you hear the senators gasping when I took two at once? [slowing down] Their perfect world crumbled in moments. [Shrieking victory] We've proven that birth means nothing when steel meets flesh in honest combat!
[Shaking voice] I thought we'd die today, truly. [more confident] Instead, we've written ourselves into Rome's history with blood. [Hysterical laughter] The emperor's champions—defeated by two nameless gladiators who refused to kneel or break!
[Breathless wonder] The crowd threw flowers instead of stones. [steadying] Women weep for our victory, children chant our names in streets. [Triumphant cry] We've become what every gladiator dreams—heroes instead of corpses in sand!
[Reverent whisper] The gods watched us today, I felt it. [normal tone] Mars himself guided my blade through their defenses. [Screaming] We were instruments of divine justice, punishing their hubris with our humble, savage strength!
[Final roar] Tonight we feast as free men! [quieter triumph] Tomorrow brings new battles, but nothing can steal this moment. [Whispered intensity] We are gladiators who conquered champions, and Rome herself trembles at what we've done!
[concerned] Ms. Wilson, I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing increased discomfort. [professionally] Let me pull up your file from Tuesday, November 14th... [pause] Can you describe specifically where the pain is radiating?
[calmly] That sounds like potential sciatic nerve involvement, which is concerning. [more urgently] I need you to come in immediately—can you make it by 3:30 PM today? [reassuringly] We'll do a complete reassessment, no charge, reference code NC-1147.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration completely, Ms. Wilson. [firmly] However, sometimes the body needs 48 to 72 hours to adjust—though your symptoms do sound atypical. [more gently] Let's focus on getting you relief first.
[professionally] Your insurance is active in our system, yes. [concerned tone] But Ms. Wilson, that's too much ibuprofen—please reduce to 600mg maximum. [more insistently] Can you rate your pain from 1 to 10 right now?
[very seriously] Ms. Wilson, with pain at that level, you need immediate attention. [decisively] If you can't make it here, call 911 or go to Mercy General ER. [more softly] I'll fax them your records, patient file JW-4782B-2023.
[professionally] Thank you for reaching out to our office. [quickly] I see you're inquiring about insurance coverage for therapy sessions. [more warmly] How can I help you today?
[reassuringly] Yes, we do accept BlueCross BlueShield PPO plans. [briskly] Let me explain quickly—PPO means you have out-of-network benefits too, but in-network saves you money. [helpfully] Would you like me to verify your specific benefits?
[calmly] I completely understand, insurance can be confusing. [efficiently] For most PPO plans, you don't need pre-authorization for outpatient therapy. [quickly] I'll just need your member ID and date of birth to check your benefits.
[typing tone] Let me pull that up for you right now. [briskly] While I'm checking—typically PPO plans have a deductible, then you pay a copay or coinsurance. [more slowly] Your out-of-pocket costs depend on whether you've met your deductible.
[sympathetically] I see your deductible is $2,000, you're right. [more optimistically] But here's good news—your plan covers 80% after deductible, and our session rate is $150. [quickly] So you'd pay full price until deductible, then just $30 per session.
[matter-of-factly] With $1,700 remaining on your deductible, roughly eleven sessions at full price. [encouragingly] Many clients find the investment worth it, especially since therapy is ongoing. [gently] We also offer payment plans if that helps.
[supportively] Absolutely, biweekly is perfectly fine to start. [efficiently] Dr. Martinez has openings Tuesday afternoons and Thursday mornings. [warmly] Would either of those work for your schedule?
[reassuringly] Not a stupid question at all! [briskly] We bill insurance directly, you just pay your portion at each visit. [clearly] We'll handle all the claim submissions and paperwork for you.
[confidently] We verify benefits before every session to avoid surprises. [quickly] If there's ever an issue, we contact you before providing service. [firmly] You'll always know your costs upfront—no surprise bills, I promise.
[warmly] I'm so glad we could help clarify everything. [efficiently] Tuesday at 2 PM or 4 PM? [encouragingly] Dr. Martinez is wonderful, you're making a great decision for your health.
[Slow] I'm just gonna, um, rest my eyes for like two seconds here—no, no, I'm awake, totally listening. [Groan]
[Whisper] Did anyone else just see that? [Fast] I swear the clock went backwards, I'm not even kidding right now.
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, another pie chart about quarterly projections—this is, uh, this is exactly what my Tuesday needed. [Tsk]
[Happy] Coffee break! [Laugh] Finally, I can—wait, we're not done yet? Seriously?
[Angry] If he says "synergy" one more time, I'm gonna literally lose it, I mean, who even talks like that? [Groan]
[Sad] I used to be, like, excited about these meetings, y'know? [Sigh] Now I just kinda feel my soul leaving my body.
[Fast] Quick, someone ask a question so I can, um, so I can wake up a bit—I'm drifting here, people! [Chuckle]
[Disappointed] This could've been an email. [Slow] This really, really could've been a two-sentence email, couldn't it?
[Whisper] [Fast] Pinch me, pinch me right now before I start snoring—no wait, that's too obvious, just kick my chair.
[Shout] What? Oh, sorry, I was just—[Laugh]—enthusiastically agreeing with your point about, uh, the thing you just said!
[Slow] The fluorescent lights are literally humming a lullaby right now, and I'm, I'm fighting for my life here. [Sigh]
[Happy] Only forty-seven minutes left! [Sarcastic] I mean, who's counting, right?
[Angry] [Fast] My phone's dead, I've counted the ceiling tiles twice, and I swear time has actually stopped moving forward.
[Disappointed] I drove through rush hour traffic for this? [Tsk] [Slow] For a PowerPoint that hasn't changed since 2019?
[Whisper] Is it just me or does his voice sound exactly like, um, like white noise? [Chuckle] [Fast] I'm basically being hypnotized here.
[Sad] I had such big plans for today, y'know, and now I'm just—[Sigh]—now I'm watching my life tick away, slide by slide.
[Sarcastic] Sure, let's dive deeper into subsection 4B, because the first hour wasn't thorough enough, apparently. [Groan]
[Slow] [Whisper] If I just slowly slide down in my chair, maybe I can disappear under the—no, he's looking at me.
[Happy] [Fast] Wait, are those donuts? There are donuts! Suddenly I'm wide awake and very interested in this budget report!
[Angry] My leg's gone numb, my brain's gone numb, everything's just—[Tsk]—I gotta get outta here before I become part of the furniture.
SCENARIO: Complaining about a weird noise in the car, then it stopping on its own
I didn't—okay, I didn't lie exactly. I just... I mean, you were so excited about it and I didn't wanna be the one to, y'know, crush that. Is that really so terrible?
Come on, that's not—you're acting like I committed some huge crime here. I was trying to be supportive! You literally spent weeks on that thing and I thought—I dunno, I thought being encouraging was the right move.
And I get that, but honestly? Sometimes people say they want honesty when they really don't. [scoff] Like, you were practically glowing when you showed it to me—what was I supposed to say?
The truth. Right. Okay okay, so next time you're all proud of something, I should just—what, tear it apart? That's what you want from me? Because that feels pretty crappy too, just saying.
That's—no, that's not on me. I mean, I'm sorry you felt embarrassed, I really am, but you can't put that all on me. Other people saw it too, right? They could've said something.
Oh, come on, don't—don't do that. [frustrated laugh] I AM your friend, which is exactly why I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. You think I enjoyed pretending? It was awkward as hell for me too.
I knew it was... look look, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't—okay fine, yeah, it needed work. But you seemed so sure about it, and I figured, y'know, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it would land differently with other people.
I'm not making—ugh, seriously? I'm trying to explain where I was coming from here. And yeah, I messed up, I get that, but you're not exactly being fair either. You're acting like I did this to sabotage you or something.
That's... [sigh] okay, that's fair. I guess I did. But honestly? I thought I was protecting you. Which—yeah yeah, I know how that sounds now, but at the time it felt like the right thing.
No. It wasn't. And I'm—I'm sorry about that part, I really am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I was coming from a good place, even if I... even if I totally screwed it up.
Oh god, yeah, I—I know I got a little intense. Wait wait, no, that's not—I got way too intense, you're right. I'm sorry, I just get really into games sometimes and I know that's not an excuse.
What do you—oh. Oh no. Is this about the running thing too? Because I swear I didn't mean to make it weird when you said you ran a 5K, I was just excited that I'd done one too and—[nervous laugh]—okay yeah, I see how that came off.
I don't—wait, I made the cooking class competitive? How did I even—actually no, you know what, you're right. I remember. I literally turned making pasta into some kind of contest. God, I'm such an idiot.
I know. I know it is and I'm—I'm really sorry. It's just, growing up with three older siblings, everything was a competition, y'know? Like who could eat fastest, who got better grades, who could—[sigh] but that's not your problem. I shouldn't make it your problem.
No no no, please don't say that. That's—that's the last thing I want. I love when you share stuff with me, I really do. I think maybe I just get so excited that I wanna share too and then it becomes this whole—ugh, I'm doing it wrong.
Can we—can we maybe start over? Like, I promise I'll work on it. I'll literally bite my tongue if I have to. Actually, my therapist says I should try active listening more anyway, so maybe this is—sorry, not about me. This is about you. About us.
Yeah, I've been going for a couple months now. Not just for this! But it's kinda helped me realize that I do this thing where I need external validation constantly? And competing is like—it's basically my broken way of connecting with people. Which is messed up, I know.
I didn't wanna make a big deal about it. Plus I figured you'd tell me about your therapy and then I'd—oh my god, I would've made therapy competitive too, wouldn't I? [groan] I'm literally the worst.
Yeah, that's—that's fair. Really fair, actually. Um, would it help if we had like a code word or something? For when I'm doing it? So you can call me out? Because honestly, half the time I don't even realize I'm doing it until after.
Really? You'd—you'd do that? Oh thank god, I thought you were gonna stop being my friend entirely. I mean, I would've understood but I really really don't wanna lose you. You're like, one of the most important people in my life and I—yeah. I'll do better. Promise.
What? That's—that's not even—okay, where is this coming from? I apologize when I need to apologize. When I've actually done something wrong, y'know?
Well yeah, obviously. I'm not gonna apologize for stuff I didn't—look, if this is about yesterday, I already told you I didn't think it was that big a deal. [scoff] You're acting like I never take responsibility.
That's—come on, that's literally not true. Remember when I forgot your birthday dinner? I apologized like fifty times. Or when I accidentally told Jake about your promotion before you could? I owned that.
Okay okay, but—sometimes I genuinely don't realize something's wrong until you tell me. That doesn't mean I'm not sorry, it just means I'm not a [frustrated laugh] mind reader, y'know?
That's not what I—ugh, you're twisting my words. Look, I'm sorry if you feel like I don't apologize enough, but honestly? Sometimes you get upset about stuff that's just... I dunno, not actually my fault?
Um, literally last month? When you got mad that I went to Sarah's party without you? You said you didn't wanna go, so I went, and then suddenly I'm the bad guy for not convincing you harder or whatever.
That's—that's exactly what happened! You literally said "go without me" and I did, and then you were cold to me for like three days. [sigh] And I still said sorry, by the way, even though I didn't think I did anything wrong.
Because I was! I was sorry you felt bad, but I wasn't gonna pretend I did something terrible when I—when I literally just listened to what you told me to do.
No no no, don't—don't do that. Don't shut down just because I'm defending myself. You brought this up, and now you're mad that I'm not just... what, falling on my sword? Admitting I'm always wrong?
I'm—okay, fine. Maybe I could be better about that, I guess. But you gotta admit, sometimes you expect apologies for stuff that's just... life happening, y'know? Not everything needs to be somebody's fault.
SCENARIO: attempting to read small print without glasses
[exhausted] So... that was the worst set of my entire life. [long pause] The silence after my airline food joke was so thick, [voice cracking] I could've carved it with a knife and served it as dessert.
[defensive] Come on, the crowd was dead from the start! [pleading] That guy in the front row was literally asleep before I even grabbed the mic. [quieter] Maybe my material just went over their heads?
[frantically] But I workshopped that one for weeks! [higher pitch] Sarah said it was hilarious when I practiced it at her place. [mumbling] Though she was pretty drunk at the time, now that I think about it.
[desperately cheerful] Okay but what about when I recovered with the impression? [voice dropping] The manager seemed to smile... [trailing off] or maybe that was a grimace, hard to tell in that lighting actually.
[defeated whisper] Should I just quit? [stronger] Five years of open mics and I'm still bombing like it's my first night. [Shaky breath] Even the bartender stopped pretending to laugh at this point.
[hopeful] You really think there's still hope? [nervously fast] Because I've got this new bit about dating apps that I've been working on and— [stopping short] wait, you're making that face again.
[frustrated growl] But unique doesn't pay bills! [sarcastically] Should I talk about my thrilling life as a part-time barista who lives with three roommates? [deflating] Because that's my unique perspective right there.
[skeptical] You want me to go up there and just... [slowly] talk about my actual pathetic life? [Nervous giggle] "Hey everyone, today my roommate used my coffee mug as an ashtray, how's your Tuesday?"
[considering] I did have that thing happen with the landlord and the raccoons last week. [building excitement] And my roommate's girlfriend who keeps stealing our toilet paper. [brightening] Maybe you're onto something here.
[renewed energy] Alright, new plan then! [determined] I'm ditching all the airplane food garbage and going full millennial-crisis mode. [laughing] If I'm going down, at least it'll be as myself.
[professionally cheerful] Thank you for calling about policy PET-447892X! [more gently] I completely understand the confusion—pre-existing conditions can be tricky. [reassuring tone] Basically, any diagnosed condition before your coverage start date of March 15th, 2024, would be considered pre-existing.
[thoughtfully] That's actually a great point about veterinary language. [more carefully] We'd need to review the complete medical records from Dr. Morrison's office. [helpful tone] Even informal observations can sometimes be classified as pre-existing, but [optimistic] nervous behavior alone might not exclude coverage.
[empathetic] I can see why you're concerned about the investment you've made. [professional] Let me pull up your claim history under account WH-3847-ANXC. [reassuring] Since you've been continuously covered, we might have options through our behavioral wellness add-on.
[calmly] Actually, the behavioral add-on is only $12.50 monthly, effective immediately. [more enthusiastically] And here's something interesting—since there's a gap between 2019 and 2024 with no treatment, [hopeful] we might consider this a new episode rather than continuation.
[carefully] Our underwriting department at extension 5521 would make the final determination. [more confidently] But yes, gaps over 24 months often qualify for reconsideration. [warmly] I can expedite your case to senior reviewer Ms. Chen, reference number SR-9984-FELX, for review within 48 hours.
[briskly] Good afternoon, Riverside Auto, service department speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today—do you have an appointment or, uh, a question about your vehicle?
[apologetically] Oh, I see, let me just... pull up your information here. [more quickly] What's your VIN number or—actually, your name and the vehicle year would work too, whatever's easier.
[reassuringly] Okay, Ms. Davidson, I'm seeing your file here. [faster pace] The recall is precautionary, but we do recommend scheduling service within, um, thirty days. [more firmly] You're safe to drive, just avoid any aggressive steering maneuvers.
[quickly] No, no, normal driving is completely fine, I meant like—racing or extremely sharp turns at high speeds. [more calmly] Let me check our earliest availability for the repair, which takes about two hours.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, truly. [briskly] For recall work, we prioritize those appointments and—here we go—I can get you in Thursday at eight AM. [hopefully] Would that work?
[quickly] Absolutely, one hundred percent covered—parts, labor, everything. [reassuringly] We'll even provide a loaner vehicle if you need one, though most customers just wait since it's, you know, relatively quick.
[enthusiastically] Oh yes, definitely! [more quickly] I'll add a note right now about the clicking sound, and since they'll already be working on the steering column, it might even be related.
[firmly] I've highlighted it in your file, and I'll personally mention it to Jake, our lead technician. [briskly] Now, you'll get a confirmation text shortly with all the details—Thursday, eight AM sharp.
[quickly] Just bring the recall notice if you have it handy, but honestly, we have everything in the system already. [cheerfully] Oh, and your keys, obviously—sometimes people forget those!
[reassuringly] Completely safe for normal driving, I promise. [more gently] If you experience any actual steering problems before then—which is highly unlikely—just call us immediately, and we'll arrange a tow.
[Sigh] You know what, I'm just gonna—I'm gonna order pizza and watch something stupid, okay? [Chuckle] That's self-care, right?
[Fast] Honestly, if one more thing goes wrong today, I swear I'm just gonna lose it completely. [Groan] [Angry] Like, how is this even possible?
[Happy] Wait, my favorite show just dropped a new season! [Laugh] I mean, the day's been trash but at least there's, uh, there's that.
[Whisper] Maybe I should just, like, crawl into bed and pretend today never happened. [Slow] Tomorrow's gotta be better, right?
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, because what I really needed was to spill coffee on myself too. [Tsk] Perfect ending to a perfect day.
[Disappointed] I thought treating myself to ice cream would help, but I'm still just—ugh, I dunno, empty? [Sigh]
[Shout] Okay, that's it! [Fast] I'm done feeling sorry for myself—gonna blast some music and just, like, dance it out!
[Slow] My mom always said bad days are just... um, what was it? [Chuckle] Something about tomorrow being a gift or whatever.
[Sad] I keep trying to—to find something good about today, but honestly? [Whisper] I got nothing.
[Happy] You know what, screw it—I'm gonna take a bubble bath with, like, all the fancy stuff I've been saving. [Laugh]
[Angry] Why do I even bother trying when everything just—[Groan] No, you know what? Not doing this to myself.
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh look, my horoscope says today's gonna be great for new opportunities—bit late for that advice, stars.
[Disappointed] I had this whole plan to, um, to turn things around after lunch, but then I just... [Tsk] couldn't.
[Slow] Maybe I should call someone? [Sigh] Actually, no, I don't wanna dump all this on—never mind.
[Chuckle] At least my cat's happy to see me, even if I'm a total mess right now. [Happy] C'mere, buddy.
[Shout] [Angry] This day can officially bite me! I'm so—wait, is that wine still in the fridge?
[Whisper] Tomorrow I'll wake up and this'll all just be, like, a weird bad memory. [Slow] [Sad] Hopefully.
[Fast] Okay so basically I'm gonna make a list of—no wait, lists stress me out. [Laugh] Forget the list!
[Disappointed] I really thought today would be different, y'know? [Sigh] Like, I actually woke up feeling good for once.
[Happy] [Fast] Found twenty bucks in my jacket pocket—I mean, the day sucked but hey, surprise money's kinda nice!
SCENARIO: Frustrated about being put on a waitlist, then gets the call mid-rant that they're in
Oh god, I know—I saw that and I meant to reply right away but then I got distracted and—wait wait, that's not an excuse, I'm not making excuses. I just... I'm really bad at this stuff, you know?
That's—okay, that's fair. That's totally fair and I'm being a complete hypocrite. [nervous laugh] I literally sent you like eight texts in a row last week asking if you were mad at me because you didn't reply for two hours. God, I'm the worst.
I don't even—I don't know why I do that? Like, honestly, I see your message and I think "oh I'll reply when I have more time to give a good response" and then I just... forget. But when you don't reply I immediately assume you hate me which is so—it's so stupid, I know.
No no no, you're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—[sigh]—I'm sorry. I've been a really shitty friend about this. Like, expecting you to be available 24/7 when I can't even remember to text back? That's messed up.
Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. That's—I didn't even think about the reservation and now you probably—they probably charged you a fee, didn't they? I'll pay you back, obviously, I'll Venmo you right now, I'm literally opening the app as we speak.
I know. I know it's not, it's about—it's about me being reliable, right? And I'm not. I'm really, really not and that's... that's gotta change. Like, starting now, I promise.
Yeah, I—yeah. But I mean it this time? Okay that sounds—every time someone says "this time is different" it's never different but I swear I'm gonna actually try. Maybe I'll set reminders or something, I dunno, but I gotta figure this out because I can't keep doing this to you.
Wait, you—you've been upset about this for a while? And you didn't say anything? [groan] Because you knew I'd just apologize and not change, right? God, I really am that person. The flaky friend who everyone just... puts up with.
That's—okay now I'm gonna cry. You're my best friend too and I've been treating you like—like you don't matter as much as my stupid anxiety about replying perfectly and that's so backwards. You matter more than anyone. You really do.
Yes. Yes, absolutely. Even if it's just an emoji or—or whatever, I'll respond. And I'll stop freaking out when you take a normal amount of time to reply because that's—that's on me, not you. I'm really, really sorry. Thank you for... for telling me instead of just giving up on me.
SCENARIO: trying to decide if this headache warrants medicine
[defensive] Look Mom, the Ferber method is backed by research. [speaking faster] We check on her every five minutes, then ten, then fifteen. [firmly] She's learning to self-soothe, and it's only been three nights so far.
[exhausted sigh] Mom, I haven't slept more than two hours straight in eight months. [pleading] The pediatrician recommended this. [more firmly] Besides, crying for a few minutes won't damage her emotionally—that's just outdated thinking from your generation.
[controlled frustration] It's been exactly four minutes, Mom. [checking watch nervously] One more minute and I go in. [defensive whisper] This is harder for me than her—she won't even remember this tomorrow morning.
[voice breaking] That's not fair and you know it! [steadying breath] I'm teaching her healthy sleep habits. [desperately] Do you think I enjoy this? My heart breaks every single time, but it's working—she slept six hours last night!
[near tears] You think I don't know that? [angry whisper] Every instinct screams at me to run in there! [voice cracking] But I'm drowning here, Mom. I need sleep to function, to work, to be a good parent.
[long pause] That's... that's really sweet, Mom. [conflicted] But what happens when you leave? [frustrated groan] We'd be right back where we started, except now she'd be even more confused about bedtime.
[defensive shout] Because we know better now! [calming down] We have studies about SIDS, about attachment, about sleep cycles. [determined] I'm not just winging it like your generation did—I'm making informed decisions here.
[breaking down] Stop it, just stop! [sobbing] You think this is easy for me? [angry tears] Every night I question everything, wonder if I'm ruining her, but at least I'm trying something!
[sniffling] It's been five minutes. [determined exhale] I need to go check on her now. [steadier voice] Just a quick pat, reassuring words, then back out. Want to watch on the monitor with me?
[relieved whisper] Thanks Mom. [hopeful] Listen—she's already calming down. [amazed] Yesterday it took twenty minutes, today just seven. [trembling laugh] Maybe this really is working. God, I hope I'm doing the right thing.
[professionally calm] I understand your frustration, sir. [apologetically] May I please have your member ID and date of birth to pull up your account? [steady] I'll need to verify a few things before we can discuss the specifics of your case.
[typing tone] Thank you, Mr. Peterson. [pause] I see here the denial was issued on February 8th for insufficient medical necessity documentation. [carefully] Your provider submitted forms A-1127 and B-3342, but we're still missing the prior authorization supplement.
[slightly defensive] Sir, I'm showing those faxes were received but... [hesitant] they were sent to our old processing center. [more firmly] As of January 1st, all prior authorizations need to go to department PA-7700 at our Memphis location.
[sympathetically] I do apologize for the confusion, Mr. Peterson. [professionally] I can expedite a new review if your doctor resubmits to fax number 901-555-8827. [reassuring] With proper documentation to code PA-7700-SURG, we can have an answer within 72 hours.
[uncomfortable] Unfortunately, our system doesn't allow transfers between departments. [more gently] However, I can escalate this to supervisor review, case number EMG-2024-0298. [helpfully] They might be able to override if you file an urgent appeal by tomorrow at 5 PM Eastern.
[slightly offended] Sir, I'm trying to help you here. [more patiently] You'll need form URA-2024, available under "Member Resources," then "Appeals," then "Urgent Medical." [precisely] Make sure to include your reference number, which is now MED-47562-BD4789-UR.
[clarifying] That's B-David-4789-UR, correct. [relieved] No notarization needed for urgent appeals, just your signature and your physician's NPI number. [warning tone] But it must be submitted electronically through our portal, not faxed or mailed.
[cautiously] Out-of-network reimbursement requires pre-approval through form OON-789. [apologetically] Without prior authorization, we can only reimburse at 20% of the Medicare rate. [quietly] For procedure 47562, that would be approximately $1,200 of the $18,000 cost.
[defensively] Mr. Peterson, we approve 87% of all submitted claims. [more softly] I genuinely want to help resolve this for you. [encouragingly] If you submit the appeal by tomorrow with case number EMG-2024-0298, I'll personally flag it for expedited review.
[professionally] That's correct, and please reference my employee ID, T-9923-Austin, in your appeal. [reassuringly] I've made detailed notes in your file about today's call at 2:47 PM. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help clarify about the appeals process today?
[professionally] Thank you for calling TechFlow Solutions, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I assist you with your software today?
[apologetically] I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing those problems. [more briskly] Let me pull up your account and we'll get this sorted—what's your subscription email?
[quickly] Got it, I see your account here, Ms. Johnson. [reassuringly] The freezing issue is actually a known bug we're addressing—[more urgently] our team pushed a hotfix about an hour ago.
[calmly] The patch might not have auto-installed yet. [briskly] Can you check your version number—bottom left corner, help menu, then about?
[quickly] That's the old version, the fix is 4.2.3. [more enthusiastically] Good news though—I can manually push the update to your system right now, should only take about two minutes.
[sympathetically] That's incredibly frustrating, I understand. [more optimistically] The new version has an auto-recovery feature that might—and I stress might—retrieve your recent work from the cache files.
[professionally] Absolutely understood. [quickly] I'm initiating the update now—you should see a prompt—and I'm also adding a service credit to your account for the inconvenience.
[briskly] I'm applying a full month's credit, that's $89 value. [reassuringly] Plus, I'm escalating this to ensure you get priority queue status for any future support needs.
[quickly] Just restart the application once it hits a hundred percent. [more detailed] Then check the File menu for "Recover Recent Work"—fingers crossed your data is there.
[enthusiastically] Excellent! [more professionally] Click "Restore All" and let it process—should have everything back within thirty seconds or so.
[Angry] Are you—are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I literally checked the status like five minutes ago!
[Disappointed] So that's it, huh? [Sigh] Three months of planning and it's just... gone.
[Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, this is just, um, exactly what I needed today. [Tsk] Perfect timing, really.
[Fast] Wait wait wait, I gotta—I need to call my boss right now or I'm totally screwed. [Groan]
[Whisper] I can't tell my mom about this, she's gonna absolutely lose it if she finds out I'm not coming.
[Happy] Actually, you know what? [Laugh] Maybe this is the universe telling me I wasn't supposed to go anyway!
[Slow] Let me, uh, let me get this straight here... [Disappointed] Every single flight today is just done?
[Sad] I was finally gonna see them after—god, it's been what, two years? [Sigh] [Slow] Two whole years.
[Angry] [Fast] Okay so basically you're telling me that nobody thought to mention this earlier? Like, nobody?
[Chuckle] My ex is on that flight too, so honestly? [Happy] This might be the best thing that's ever happened to me!
[Disappointed] I mean, I kinda had a feeling something would go wrong, but... [Tsk] not this.
[Shout] How is "mechanical issues" even an excuse anymore? [Angry] It's 2024 for crying out loud!
[Whisper] [Sad] The funeral's tomorrow morning and I—I don't know how I'm gonna make it now.
[Sarcastic] Sure, yeah, a voucher for fifty bucks will totally make up for missing my wedding. [Tsk] [Angry] Thanks so much.
[Fast] [Happy] Oh my god, wait—if I'm stuck here, that means I can actually go to Sarah's party tonight!
[Slow] You know what's funny? [Chuckle] I literally had a dream about this exact thing happening last night.
[Sad] [Whisper] I just wanna go home, I'm so tired of—I can't do this anymore, I really can't.
[Angry] [Fast] No no no, don't put me on hold again, I've been—hello? HELLO?
[Disappointed] [Slow] Guess I'm, uh, guess I'm sleeping in the airport tonight then, right?
[Sarcastic] [Laugh] Twenty-three hours of delays would've been fine, but cancelled? Now that's just special.
SCENARIO: Mad about a restaurant getting their order wrong twice, then they comp the whole meal
Oh god, I—I know, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get that drunk, honestly I thought I was fine and then suddenly everything just hit me all at once and—
I know, I know, it was—it was awful. Like, I woke up this morning and literally wanted to die when I remembered. Wait, no, that's not—I mean, I feel terrible about it. [groan] I can't believe I did that to you.
Yeah, I—okay, so here's what happened. I had the three shots, right? But then Karen from accounting kept buying rounds and I didn't wanna be rude, y'know? And I thought—I thought I could handle it because I'd eaten dinner but apparently not.
No, she—she wasn't. That was all me. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. I literally ruined your whole work party, didn't I? Your boss probably thinks you hang out with total disasters now.
He what? Oh my god, no no no, I'm not—I don't have a problem, I swear. It was just one stupid night where I didn't—I wasn't paying attention to how much I was drinking and I'm so, so sorry.
Okay, that's—that's fair. The birthday thing was bad too. And New Year's. But I promise you, like genuinely promise, I'm gonna get better about knowing my limits. I don't wanna be that friend, y'know? The one who always—[sigh] the one who always makes everything about their drama.
I know you did and I—I owe you so much for that. Like, you could've just left me there but you didn't and... I'm gonna make this up to you, okay? Whatever you need. I'll call your boss, apologize personally, pay for dry cleaning, literally anything.
Right, yeah, no—of course not. That would be... yeah. Um, but seriously though, there's gotta be something I can do? I hate that I put you in that position. Like, you were so excited about this party and I just—I ruined it completely.
I did. I really, really did. And I'm—look, I know saying sorry doesn't fix it but I need you to know that I'm gonna do better. No more drinking at your work things, actually maybe no more drinking period for a while because clearly I can't—I can't trust myself right now.
Yeah? Okay, then—then that's what I'm doing. Stone cold sober from now on, at least until I figure out how to not be a complete disaster. And I'm—I'm really sorry. You're like my best friend and I hate that I embarrassed you like that. It won't happen again, I promise.
I know, I know, okay? But my mom literally called me crying about my grandma being in the hospital and I—I had to go. What was I supposed to do?
I did tell you! I texted you like—okay, maybe it was last minute, but everything happened so fast. [frustrated laugh] We were literally in the car already when I remembered to message you.
Yeah, and I'm sorry about the timing, but come on—my grandma was having chest pains. You're acting like I just decided to skip it for fun or something.
I know that, and I wanted to be there, I really did. But you're—you're making it sound like I had a choice here. Family emergencies don't exactly schedule themselves around our plans, y'know?
That's not—okay, that's not fair. Everyone else wasn't dealing with their grandma potentially dying. [sigh] Look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but this is kinda harsh.
And I needed to be with my family! God, why is that so hard for you to—I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I missed it. But I'm not gonna apologize for prioritizing my grandma.
Fine? That's it? Just "fine"? You know what, I'm getting pretty frustrated here too because it feels like you don't even care about what I was going through that night.
That's—wow. That's really what you think? I've been to every single other thing you've done. Every open mic, every rehearsal you wanted me at. One time—ONE time—I can't make it because of an actual emergency and suddenly I don't care?
Yeah, and I feel terrible about that, honestly I do. But you're not—[scoff] you're not even trying to understand. Like, at all. My grandma could've died and you're mad about a show.
I know it wasn't just—look, I know how much it meant to you, okay? And maybe I should've... I dunno, tried harder to explain or something. But I'm not gonna stand here and pretend I made the wrong choice. I didn't.
Um, okay? What's—what's going on? You've been weird all week and now you're doing this whole dramatic thing where you're like... I dunno, being all intense.
That's—okay, that's not even true. I checked it maybe like three times? Four? And honestly, you're always telling me stuff while I'm trying to work, so—[scoff] sorry if I had to respond to my boss.
Wait, what? When did—why didn't you say that? You were just talking about random stuff, I didn't know it was... I mean, you gotta tell me these things.
No, you—okay okay, maybe you mentioned something but you didn't say it was serious. You're always so casual about everything, how was I supposed to know this was different? [frustrated laugh] I'm not a mind reader.
Look, if you said that—and I'm not saying you didn't—but if you did, I obviously didn't hear it properly. Maybe I was distracted, fine, but you could've like, I dunno, made sure I was listening?
That's not—come on, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry about your dad, I am, that's terrible. But you're acting like I don't care when really I just... [sigh] I literally had three deadlines yesterday.
See, this is what you do. You make it sound like—like my stuff doesn't matter at all. Yeah, they're not family emergencies, but I can't just ignore my whole life every time you need to talk.
I know, I know! And I'm—I feel terrible about missing that, okay? But honestly? You do this thing where you just expect me to drop everything, and usually I do, but yesterday was literally the worst possible day.
Oh my god, stop. That's so—you're being so unfair right now. I've been there for you through everything, literally everything, and the one time I'm not perfect, you're gonna—what, throw away our whole friendship?
I—okay. You're right. [quieter] How is he? Is he gonna be okay? I should've—yeah, I should've asked that first. I'm just... I'm defensive 'cause I feel like shit about this, y'know?
What? Wait, I—hold on, what do you mean? I thought we were—I mean, after everything that happened, I figured we just kinda... moved past it?
Okay, that's—that's not what I meant. I just, um, I thought since we were still hanging out and stuff that you weren't—[nervous laugh] god, I'm such an idiot. You've been upset this whole time, haven't you?
No no no, you're right. You're totally right. I should've—I mean, obviously I should've actually talked to you about it instead of just... pretending nothing happened. That was really messed up of me.
I honestly don't know why I didn't say anything. Like, I knew I hurt you—I could see it on your face when it happened, y'know? And I just... I dunno, I got scared? [groan] That's not an excuse though.
God, I'm—I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I was being a coward, basically, and that's not fair to you at all. You deserved an apology right away, not... whatever this is.
The comment about—about your presentation, right? When I said it was "kinda basic" in front of everyone? I've been replaying it in my head and I just—ugh, I wanna crawl into a hole every time I think about it.
Wait wait wait, there's more? Oh god—was it also when I laughed? Because I swear I wasn't laughing at you, I was just nervous and—actually no, that doesn't matter. Impact over intent, right? I hurt you and that's what matters. [sigh]
I did. I literally watched you stay up till like 3 AM working on it for weeks. And then I just—I opened my stupid mouth and ruined it. I'm so, so sorry. I should've been supporting you, not... being an absolute jerk.
Because I'm—I'm really bad at confrontation? And the longer I waited, the worse it got, and then I convinced myself that bringing it up would make things weird when really I was already making things weird by not saying anything. Classic me, honestly, making everything worse.
I know. And I'm sorry—not just for what I said, but for taking this long to apologize. You're one of my best friends and you deserved so much better than... than me being too scared to own up to my mistakes. Can we—can we be okay?
Got in? Got in where? Wait—oh my god, is this about the residency thing? The one in, um, where was it again?
Shut up shut up shut UP! Are you—this is huge! Like, this is literally what you've been working toward for, what, two years now? [Gasp] Oh my god, when do you leave?
Okay okay, I mean, yeah, of course you're still processing because this is like—this changes everything, right? You're gonna have actual time to just... create. No distractions, no stupid day job stuff.
Wait, terrifying? But you—honestly, you've been complaining about never having enough time for your work since, like, forever. Isn't this kinda exactly what you wanted?
Oh no no no, okay, I get it now. The whole—the pressure thing. But like [Sigh] you wouldn't have gotten in if they didn't already think your stuff was incredible, y'know?
That's—wait, that's like less than, um, two percent? Holy shit. You beat out literally hundreds of people and you're worried about—actually, you know what? This is so you.
I mean, you always do this thing where something amazing happens and you immediately start, like, catastrophizing about it? Remember when you got that gallery show and spent the whole week before convinced everyone would hate it? [Chuckle]
Was it though? Was it really? Because from where I'm sitting, it's the same exact—you're doing that face. The one where you know I'm right but you're gonna be stubborn about it anyway.
Okay but like—nobody's ever ready ready, right? That's kinda the whole point of these things. You go, you figure it out, you probably have some breakdowns in the studio at 2am, and then you make something incredible.
Um, are you kidding me right now? If you don't go, I will literally—I don't know what I'll do but it'll be dramatic and you'll hate it. This is your thing, babe. Your actual thing.
SCENARIO: debating whether to send a risky text
[voice breaking] Mom always said she wanted to be scattered here, [quieter] where Dad proposed. [Sharp inhale] I keep thinking she's going to walk up behind us and laugh about how we're doing it all wrong.
[firmly] We should say something. [more uncertainly] She deserves words, proper ones. [clearing throat] Though everything I practiced in the car sounds stupid now that we're actually standing here with the urn.
[suddenly urgent] Wait, wait—are we doing this too fast? [panicked] Once she's in the wind, that's it. [voice dropping] No more putting flowers on a grave, no place to visit when we need her.
[defensive] My jokes aren't terrible! [cracking] She laughed at every single one. [whispered] Even the really bad ones about chickens crossing roads. Sometimes I still catch myself saving the good ones to tell her.
[rushed words] The wind's picking up—should we do it now? [steadier] Together, like we promised? [Shuddering breath] I can't believe this is really happening, that we're really saying goodbye to her forever.
[determined] One. [more shakily] This is for all the bedtime stories and band-aids. [Gulping breath] For every time she said she was proud of us even when we didn't deserve it.
[in unison] Three. [Soft gasp] Oh God, look at her go—she's dancing in the sunlight. [through tears] The way the ashes catch the light, it's actually beautiful, like she's becoming part of everything.
[exhausted] My hands won't stop shaking. [quieter] Is it wrong that I already miss having the urn to hold? [Ragged breath] At least that was something solid, something that proved she existed.
[suddenly clear] We should head back before dark. [gentler] But maybe we could stop at that diner she loved? [Sniffling] Order her usual and leave the seat empty—one last meal together.
[peaceful] The water's so calm now. [in wonder] Like it was waiting for her. [Deep breath] I think I finally understand why she chose this place—it's not an ending, it's a joining.
[gruff] Yeah, hello, this is Harold Brennan calling about my mother, Ethel Brennan, [raising voice] she's in room 247-B. [clears throat] I need to speak to someone immediately about the, uh, the absolutely unacceptable conditions she's been subjected to.
[impatiently] It's WB2024-8847-J, for crying out loud. [bitter] She called me yesterday saying nobody's changed her bedsheets in over a week, [getting louder] and the food's been cold every single meal since Tuesday!
[sarcastically] Oh, she mentioned plenty—that nurse, uh, Rodriguez or Ramirez, badge number 4-5-something. [sighs heavily] Look, we're paying $8,750 a month for proper care, [more forcefully] not for her to sit in filth!
[outraged] Miscommunication? [scoffs] My mother's sharp as a tack—she's got her doctorate from Harvard, for God's sake! [accusingly] Are you suggesting she's lying about the neglect at your establishment?
[grudgingly] Fine, but I'm also contacting the state ombudsman at 1-800-555-CARE. [threatening] My lawyer brother already has your facility's license number—HC-7789-MA—ready for the complaint. [sighs] This better get fixed immediately.
[cheerfully] Good morning, this is Riverside Veterinary Clinic! [quickly] I see you've emailed about appointment availability—let me just pull up our schedule. [pause] How can I help your pet today?
[sympathetically] Oh, I understand that's concerning. [briskly] Let me check what we have—actually, we had a cancellation for tomorrow at 2 PM. [reassuring] Dr. Martinez is excellent with cats, especially nervous ones.
[confidently] Yes, absolutely, it's a full 30-minute consultation slot. [quickly] Dr. Martinez can do blood work, urinalysis, whatever's needed. [pause] [gently] The initial exam is $85, and we'll discuss any additional tests during the visit.
[calmly] Just bring his vaccination records if you have them. [more quickly] No need for samples unless the doctor requests them after examination. [helpfully] Oh, and maybe bring his favorite blanket—sometimes that helps with stress.
[briskly] Cover the carrier with a towel, helps reduce visual stimulation. [knowingly] Some clients spray Feliway about 15 minutes before—it's a calming pheromone. [quickly] We sell it here, but pet stores have it too.
[Nervous] So, uh, anyway... [Fast] should we maybe talk about literally anything else right now or—no? We're just gonna sit here? [Chuckle]
[Whisper] I feel like I should say something but honestly I don't—I mean, what do you even say after that? [Sigh]
[Sarcastic] Wow, this is fun. [Slow] Really enjoying the, um, the whole nobody-talking thing we've got going on here. [Tsk]
[Happy] You know what, I actually kinda like this! [Laugh] No pressure to make conversation, just... existing together, right?
[Angry] Are you seriously not gonna—look, somebody needs to say something because this is getting ridiculous! [Groan]
[Slow] Does anyone else hear that clock ticking or is it just—[Fast] okay yeah, it's definitely getting louder somehow. [Nervous] [Chuckle]
[Disappointed] I thought we were past this whole, you know, not being able to talk to each other thing. [Sigh] Guess not.
[Shout] WELL THEN! [Normal] That's, uh, that's one way to end a conversation, I guess.
[Fast] So my cat did this really funny thing yesterday where she—actually, you probably don't wanna hear about that right now, do you? [Tsk]
[Sad] This is exactly what happened last time and I just—I can't do this again, okay? [Sigh] [Whisper] Not again.
[Sarcastic] Anyone wanna play a game where we count how many seconds this lasts? [Chuckle] I'm at thirty-seven, but who's counting, right?
[Slow] You ever notice how, like, silence can be really loud sometimes? [Fast] This is one of those times, definitely one of those times.
[Happy] Oh my god, are we having a moment? [Laugh] [Whisper] Is this what people mean by comfortable silence?
[Angry] I didn't drive all the way here to just—to sit in silence! [Disappointed] Come on, somebody say something!
[Fast] Okay so basically what I'm hearing is nothing, which is—that's cool, that's totally fine, I can work with nothing. [Nervous] [Chuckle]
[Whisper] Should I just... leave? [Normal] Like, would that make this less weird or more weird? [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Great weather we're having. [Slow] Oh wait, we're inside, so... great ceiling we're having? [Groan]
[Sad] I used to be really good at filling these gaps but now I just—I dunno, I got nothing. [Sigh]
[Shout] ANYBODY WANT COFFEE? [Fast] I'm gonna go make coffee, that's what I'm doing, coffee fixes everything! [Nervous] [Laugh]
[Disappointed] We literally just met and we're already out of things to—[Slow] wow, this doesn't bode well, does it? [Tsk] [Sigh]
SCENARIO: Calmly talking about a gift they regifted, then remembering who they gave it to, then realizing it was the original gifter, ending in social horror
Oh my god, oh my god—wait, and? What did they—I mean, I know you had the blood test thing on Monday, right? Tell me everything.
It—wait, what? [Gasp] Are you saying—oh my god, are you actually pregnant right now? Like, right this second?
I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry. No no no, I'm already crying. After everything you've been through, all those months of—god, how are you even feeling right now?
Okay, yeah, that's—that's totally normal though, right? I mean, this is huge. Like, you've wanted this for so long and now it's actually... happening. [Soft laugh] Your brain probably doesn't even know what to do.
I know, babe. I know. And you were so—I mean, after the second one didn't work, you were basically ready to give up, remember? But you didn't. You kept going.
Oh god, of course she did—she's been waiting for this almost as long as you have. Actually, no, scratch that, nobody's been waiting as long as you. This is—this is your moment, y'know?
Okay, hey—no no no, we're not doing that. [Sigh] I mean, I get it, I totally get why your brain's going there, but like... can we just sit with the good news for a minute? Just let it be good?
You're not—stop, you're not being weird at all. You're being, like, incredibly human right now. After everything your body's been through? All those hormones and procedures and just... the hoping? You're allowed to feel whatever you're feeling.
Wait, you—[Chuckle] oh my god, you never told me that. That's so... okay, that's actually breaking my heart a little bit. In the best way though, because now you're gonna—you're actually gonna need it.
Come here—I need to hug you right now. Like, immediately. This is the best news I've heard in... honestly? Maybe ever. I'm so freaking happy for you.
Um, okay? That's—that's kind of ominous. What's going on? Did I do something wrong or...?
I—what? That's what this is about? Come on, you know I'm terrible at that stuff. I've been swamped with work and—okay okay, I get that's not an excuse, but seriously?
That can't be—[scoff] are you actually keeping track? Look, I respond when you text me, don't I? I show up when we make plans. I'm not like, ignoring you.
No, that's not—you're twisting what I'm saying. I care about this friendship, obviously, but you're acting like I don't just because I'm not great at reaching out first. That's kinda unfair.
And I appreciate that, I do, but maybe—maybe you could've mentioned this before it became this huge thing? Instead of just... [frustrated laugh] sitting there resenting me for months?
I am busy! That's—I mean, that's actually true. But okay, fine, I could've made more effort. I just didn't realize it was bothering you this much.
Wow. That's—wow. I do care, and you know that. Or you should know that. Just because I don't text first doesn't mean I don't think about you or—this is ridiculous.
Yeah, kinda! You're basically saying our entire friendship is one-sided, which—that's not true. I literally helped you move last month. I came to your thing when nobody else did. But sure, I'm a terrible friend.
It's what you're implying though. Look look, I get it—I should reach out more. [sigh] And I will, okay? But you gotta understand, it's not personal. I'm like this with everyone.
I—yeah. Yeah, you're right. It doesn't. I dunno what else to say here. I'm sorry I made you feel like you're not important to me, but I'm also kinda hurt that you think I don't care.
What? Oh come on, that was just—I was kidding around. Everyone was laughing, you were laughing too! I didn't think you'd actually be upset about it.
Okay okay, but like—you gotta understand, I genuinely didn't know it would bother you. We joke about everything, literally everything, and now suddenly this is off limits? [scoff] How was I supposed to know?
Personal? We've made way worse jokes about each other before! Remember when you called me a disaster at relationships for like, three months straight? But I can't make one comment about—fine, whatever.
I don't—I really don't see how it's different. Look, I'm sorry it hurt your feelings, okay? But you're acting like I deliberately tried to [frustrated laugh] humiliate you or something, which is kinda unfair.
That's not—ugh, that's not what I was doing! I was making fun of the situation, not you. The whole nepotism thing is just—it's funny because it's obviously not true. Everyone knows you earned it.
Yes! Of course they do! But now you're making me feel like the worst friend ever for what was literally just a dumb throwaway joke that I—I didn't think about it that hard, okay?
Okay but—hold on, that's not fair either. I'm supposed to analyze every single thing I say now? We were all just having fun and I—look look, I get that it stung, but you could've just told me right then instead of giving me the silent treatment.
Um, yeah? Obviously? But instead you just sat there and let me think everything was fine when apparently [sigh] you were seething the whole time. That's kinda on you too, y'know?
I'm not—I'm not turning it around, I'm just saying we both could've handled this better. And honestly? I'm a little disappointed that after all these years, you'd think I'd ever wanna actually hurt you.
No, but it should at least count for something, right? Like—I dunno, maybe you could cut me some slack here since I clearly didn't mean it the way you took it? Just—whatever, forget it.
I know, I know, I'm—god, I'm so sorry. I kept meaning to pay you back, I swear, but then my car broke down and—wait, that's not an excuse, I'm not trying to make excuses.
Yeah. Two hundred. Um, listen, I—I actually have some of it? Like, I have about eighty right now, and I can—I mean, I get paid next week so I can definitely get you more then. [nervous laugh] This is so embarrassing.
I did say that, didn't I? Shit. I really—I really thought I could do it, y'know? But then everything just kinda... fell apart. My hours got cut at work and I—no, wait wait, I'm doing it again. Making excuses.
You're right. You're totally right. I should've just—I should've told you, like, immediately when I knew I couldn't pay you back. Instead of just... avoiding it. Avoiding you, honestly. [sigh] That was really shitty of me.
Oh god, really? That's—fuck, I'm the worst. I literally saw your texts and I just couldn't—I dunno, I panicked? Like every time I went to reply I just felt so guilty that I couldn't—that's so stupid, I know that's stupid.
I know. I know you would've, that's what makes this worse, right? Like, you're literally the most understanding person and I just—I was so ashamed, I guess. Still am, obviously. Really, really ashamed.
No no no, I remember. For your—for your rent, right? Did you—please tell me you didn't get in trouble with your landlord because of me. [groan] Please.
Okay so here's what I'm gonna do—I'm gonna give you the eighty now, and then, um, I can pick up some extra shifts. My manager said—actually, doesn't matter. Point is, I'll have the rest in two weeks. Actually two weeks this time.
Yeah, that's—that's fair. But I mean it this time, I swear. I'll literally set up like an automatic transfer or something so I can't chicken out again. Would that—would that be okay?
It won't. Ever. I promise. And I—thank you for not just writing me off completely. I know I don't deserve it but... yeah. Thank you. I'm really, really sorry I put you through this.
Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm so, so sorry. I literally had the worst night and I—wait, that's not an excuse, I just—
No no no, please don't—I feel terrible already. I had it in my calendar and everything, I swear I did, but then my mom called and—[groan] okay that sounds so lame but she was having this whole crisis about my dad and I couldn't just leave her like that, you know?
You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've—I meant to, honestly. I kept thinking "I gotta text them" but then my mom would start crying again and I'd have to—and then it was like midnight and I figured it was too late and you'd be even madder if I texted then.
That was—yeah, that was stupid. Really stupid. [nervous laugh] I kinda just froze up, y'know? Like the longer I waited, the worse it got, and then I couldn't figure out what to even say that wouldn't sound like total BS.
I know. God, I know, and that makes it so much worse. I had your present wrapped and everything—it's still sitting on my kitchen counter actually, which is just... I'm literally the worst friend ever.
I wanna make it up to you. Like, seriously, whatever you want—dinner, drinks, I'll throw you another party myself, I don't care. Just please let me—let me try to fix this somehow?
Right, no, of course not. That's not—I didn't mean it like that. [sigh] I just... I really messed up and I don't know how to—like, what do you need from me? Because I'll do it. Whatever it is.
I know. And I—I failed you. Completely. There's no excuse good enough, is there? Like nothing I say is gonna change that I wasn't there when you needed me to be.
Can we—would you maybe wanna get coffee tomorrow? Or whenever you're ready, I mean. No pressure. I just... I miss you and I hate that I hurt you like this.
Yeah, totally, take all the time you need. I'll—I'll wait. And um, for what it's worth... happy belated birthday. I really am sorry.
SCENARIO: discovering their headphones are dead
[shaky voice] I got the job offer yesterday. [Deep breath] It's in Seattle—the position I've dreamed about for years. [voice breaking] But I can't imagine leaving you, leaving everything we've built here together since college.
[through tears] They want me there by next month. [quivering] I haven't even said yes yet because every time I try, I picture your face. [Gasping breath] Remember when we promised we'd be each other's maids of honor?
[pleading tone] You could come with me! [desperately faster] There are tons of marketing jobs in Seattle, and we could get a place together like we always talked about. [Sniffling] Please, just think about it for a second.
[angry suddenly] Why does growing up have to mean growing apart? [louder] This is exactly what happened to my sister and her best friend! [Bitter sob] I swore I'd never let distance destroy us like that, ever.
[laughing while crying] Remember when we got matching tattoos and swore we'd live next door forever? [nostalgic tone] God, we were so naive. [Hiccupping sob] I'm going to miss our Tuesday wine nights more than anything else.
[relieved exhale] You really mean that? Even with the time difference and everything? [hopeful whisper] I've been so scared to tell you because I thought you'd hate me. [quickly] I've been carrying this secret for three days.
[sobbing harder] Stop being so supportive, you're making this worse! [laughing through tears] I had a whole speech prepared about how we'd stay close. [softer] But you already know we will, don't you? You always know everything.
[incredulous] Replace you? [louder and firm] You're literally tattooed on my ankle, you weirdo! [dropping to whisper] No one else would understand our synchronized period cry sessions or our elaborate revenge plots. You're stuck with me forever, distance be damned.
[overwhelmed] You already bought a ticket? [voice rising] Before I even accepted the job? [Soft sob] This is why I love you, you beautiful, presumptuous person. Of course you knew I'd take it before I did.
[whimpering] Come here, I need the biggest hug. [muffled against shoulder] We're going to make this work. [fiercely] Long distance friendship is nothing compared to what we've already survived. Seattle doesn't stand a chance against us, I promise.
[professionally] Thank you for contacting FastPass Support regarding violation notice TRL-892347-X. [confused] I'm, uh, having difficulty understanding your concern—[more clearly] are you disputing the vehicle color listed on your toll violation from Highway 47?
[patiently] I can see account EZ-5739-ALPHA in our system, thank you. [more firmly] To clarify—you're saying your vehicle is burgundy, not silver as listed? [helpful tone] I'll need your license plate number to investigate this violation from Tuesday at mile marker 23.7.
[relieved] Perfect, I've located plate 4XM92KP in our system. [increasingly concerned] There's definitely a discrepancy here—your registered 2019 Honda Accord is listed as burgundy, [sighs] but the violation photo from 3:47 PM Tuesday shows what appears to be a silver Toyota Camry.
[understanding] Oh! You're suggesting someone has duplicate plates matching yours. [more seriously] This is actually a serious issue—plate cloning. [reassuringly] If you were at 482 Oak Street at 3:47 PM, do you have any proof like a receipt or security footage we could reference?
[relieved] Excellent! Transaction JC-20240315-1647 at 3:47 PM would indeed prove you weren't at the toll plaza. [professionally] I'm escalating this to our fraud department as case #FRD-098234. [warmly] We'll void violation TRL-892347-X and investigate the plate cloning issue—expect a follow-up within 48 hours.
[concerned] Three additional violations under your plate number? [typing tone] Let me pull those up... yes, I see them here, all from this week. [more decisively] Given the confirmed fraud on FRD-098234, I'm flagging all four violations for review immediately.
[reassuringly] Your account balance of $127.43 will remain untouched—we're placing a hold on all disputed charges. [more firmly] That's $140 in base violations plus $67.80 in late fees, all suspended. [helpfully] We'll also add a fraud alert flag to account EZ-5739-ALPHA.
[thoughtfully] That's an excellent point about other toll agencies. [proactively] I'll notify Bay Bridge Authority and Golden State Expressway about the plate cloning through our inter-agency alert system. [sighs] Unfortunately, each agency handles their own violations, so you may need to contact them directly.
[efficiently] I've created inter-agency alert INTER-7823-ALERT and distributed it to seven regional toll authorities. [more carefully] Each agency should flag plate 4XM92KP for manual review before issuing violations. [reassuringly] You'll receive confirmation emails at the address on file within the hour.
[advisingly] Yes, absolutely file form REG-14-B for replacement plates—that's the smartest move. [helpfully] The DMV can expedite it with our fraud case number FRD-098234 as reference. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or these violations?
[briskly] Good afternoon, welcome to Hartley's Department Store customer service. [speaking quickly] How can I assist you today—returns, exchanges, or [slightly slower] something else I can help with?
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, truly. [quick and efficient] However, our price adjustment policy only covers items purchased within, um, seventy-two hours of a sale. [more firmly] Five days unfortunately exceeds that window.
[calmly] Sir, I genuinely appreciate your loyalty to Hartley's. [speaking rapidly] Let me check with my supervisor to see if there's any flexibility we can offer. [reassuring] Would you mind holding for just a moment?
[professionally] Actually sir, I am getting my supervisor. [quickly and defensively] We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at—[pause] [more warmly] Karen will be right with you, she has more authority for these situations.
[understanding] No need to apologize, these situations are frustrating. [speaking briskly] Karen says since you have your receipt and the item's unworn, we can make a one-time exception. [cheerfully] How does store credit for the difference sound?
[warmly] It's completely fine, really. [speaking quickly] Let me just process this for you—receipt please, and I'll need your phone number for our system. [more slowly] This'll take about two minutes, tops.
[diplomatically] I know it seems strict, but [speaking rapidly] with our frequent sales and promotions, we had to set some boundaries or we'd be constantly processing adjustments. [more personally] Between you and me, I think it's too short too.
[pleasantly surprised] Oh, that's very kind! [quickly] I'm Marcus, and yes, you'll get an email survey within twenty-four hours. [chuckles softly] They are annoying, but corporate loves them, so...
[professionally cheerful] Happy to help save both your wallet and your marriage! [speaking briskly] Here's your thirty dollar store credit, valid for ninety days. [helpfully] Can I assist you with anything else while you're here?
[enthusiastically] Absolutely! [speaking rapidly] Men's sale items are on the second floor, northeast corner near the escalators. [more slowly] We've got an additional twenty percent off clearance items today only.
[Disappointed] So he shows up forty-five minutes late, right, and his first words were—I kid you not—"You look different than your photos." [Tsk] [Sigh]
[Fast] [Angry] And then, and THEN, he actually asked me to split the bill after ordering, like, three appetizers I didn't even touch!
[Whisper] I literally hid in the bathroom for ten minutes just to, um, figure out an escape plan. [Chuckle] [Sad]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, telling me about your ex for an hour straight is totally, uh, totally normal first date conversation. [Groan]
[Happy] [Laugh] Wait wait wait, the best part—he brought his mother's cookbook to show me his "signature recipes"!
[Slow] You know when you just... feel the chemistry dying in real time? [Disappointed] Like watching a plant wilt, honestly.
[Shout] HE TOOK A PHONE CALL FROM HIS DEALER! [Fast] Not like a car dealer—an actual, y'know, I had to leave immediately!
[Sad] [Sigh] I really thought this one would be different, but I guess I'm just—I dunno, maybe I'm expecting too much?
[Sarcastic] [Tsk] "You'd be prettier if you smiled more," he says, while literally chewing with his mouth open.
[Angry] The guy spent twenty minutes explaining why women shouldn't—actually, you know what, I can't even repeat it. [Groan] [Disappointed]
[Chuckle] I mean, bringing your emotional support ferret is one thing, but letting it eat off my plate? [Happy] [Laugh]
[Fast] [Whisper] So I'm sitting there thinking maybe I should just, like, pretend to get an emergency call or something when—
[Disappointed] [Slow] Three hours of my life I'm never getting back, and for what—some guy who thinks showering is optional?
[Shout] [Angry] HE ASKED THE WAITRESS FOR HER NUMBER! While I was sitting right there!
[Happy] At least the breadsticks were good, so, um, the evening wasn't a total loss, right? [Chuckle] [Sarcastic]
[Sad] [Whisper] I actually dressed up for this disaster—spent an hour on my hair and everything.
[Tsk] [Fast] He kept calling me by the wrong name even after I corrected him, like, four times—Katie, Cathy, everything but Karen!
[Slow] [Sigh] The red flags were basically, uh, doing the wave at me, but did I listen to my gut?
[Sarcastic] Nothing says romance like being asked if you "really need" to order dessert. [Angry] [Groan]
[Disappointed] [Chuckle] I should've known when his profile said "entrepreneur"—turns out that means, um, selling essential oils from his mom's basement.
SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a stain on their couch, then looking at it closer, then realizing it's mold not a stain, ending in furniture horror
Oh god, has it really been—wait, three months? No no no, that can't be right. I mean, we saw each other at... um... actually when was that party? [nervous laugh] Okay, you're right, I've been terrible.
I know, I know, and every time I felt like absolute garbage about it. It's just—work has been insane, like genuinely insane, and then my mom needed help with the house stuff and I—that's not an excuse though. I'm not trying to make excuses.
You're right. God, you're—you're totally right. I'm doing that thing where I just ramble and try to justify everything instead of just... I'm sorry. I've been a really shitty friend lately.
Okay, not just lately. Since like—since January maybe? When I got the promotion and started dating Alex and everything just kinda... [sigh] I basically disappeared on you. And that's not okay. Like, at all.
Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm—I'm the worst. I saw your text and I meant to call you back, I swear I did, but then I got pulled into this meeting and—no, that doesn't matter. I should've been there. I should've dropped everything and been there for you.
I don't—I don't even know how to apologize for that. Like, there's literally nothing I can say that makes it better. You've always been there for me, always, and the one time you really needed me, I just... wasn't.
No. No, it wasn't. [groan] I've been so caught up in my own stuff that I didn't even—I mean, I knew I was being distant but I kept telling myself "next week I'll make time" and then next week would come and I'd just... do it again.
Wait, what? When did you—oh. Oh, that's why it's been three months. Because I haven't... because you stopped reaching out and I didn't even notice. God, that's even worse somehow.
Can we—would you maybe wanna get coffee? Like right now? I know that doesn't fix anything, and I know you probably don't even want to, but I just... I miss you. I miss us. And I know that's my fault but—
Really? You'd actually—okay, yes, absolutely. Um, our usual place? I'll buy, obviously, and we can just... talk? Or not talk, if you don't wanna. I just—thank you. Seriously, thank you for even giving me the chance.
Got in? Wait wait wait—what do you mean you got in? Oh my god, is this about the—the volunteer thing?
Shut up! Are you serious? [Gasp] Oh my god, you actually—I mean, I knew you applied but like, wow, this is actually happening! When do you start?
This is so, so perfect for you. Like honestly? You've been talking about wanting to do this for—what, like a year now? Maybe more?
Two years! See, that's—that's even crazier. And you finally just went for it. What made you actually, y'know, pull the trigger?
Oh. Oh honey, that's—[Sigh] yeah, I remember you mentioning that. That must've been really hard to see.
People are just—ugh, I can't even. But like, at least now you're gonna be part of the solution, right? Making things better for these animals?
Okay no no no, none of this "we'll see" stuff. You're gonna be amazing at this. You're literally the most patient person I know—and animals? They totally sense that kinda energy.
Oh, you're definitely gonna get attached. Like, completely, ridiculously attached. [Chuckle] But isn't that—I mean, isn't that kinda the point? Caring enough to actually help?
Wait, are you already—oh my god, you're already thinking about adopting one, aren't you? This is day zero and you're already planning!
Uh-huh, sure, "just fostering." We both know you're gonna end up with like three dogs by Christmas. And honestly? I'm here for it.
SCENARIO: trying to remember what day of the week it is
[worried] I've been tracking my pulse, and it jumped from 72 to 74 [voice rising] when I stood up! [Gasp] That can't be normal. Plus, my left eyelid twitched twice this morning—I read that could mean a brain tumor.
[defensive] Sleep? How can I sleep when my pillowcase might be harboring bacteria? [whispered frantically] I wash it daily, but what if that's not enough? [louder] Yesterday, I sneezed three times in a row—definitely allergies or possibly early-stage pneumonia!
[high-pitched] But what about this freckle? [trembling] It's slightly darker than last Tuesday's photo! I've documented every mole with timestamped pictures. [urgently] And my tongue—look—there's a white spot that wasn't there during breakfast!
[rapidly] Meditation makes me notice my breathing, then I count breaths, then they seem irregular! [panicked whisper] What if I forget how to breathe automatically? [Nervous laugh] Also, my left knee clicked when I bent it—bone cancer?
[indignant] I use medical journals too! [quieter] Speaking of which, my urine was slightly yellower this morning. [building panic] Kidney failure starts subtly—I've prepared a color chart comparing every bathroom visit since Monday. Should we run labs?
[hurt] These feel like emergencies to me! [softer] What if we miss something important? [voice cracking] My grandmother ignored a headache once and—well, you know. [firmly] I just need reassurance that this weird ear pressure isn't serious.
[reluctantly] Maybe you're right about therapy. [hopeful] But first, could you check this rash? [quickly] It appeared after I used new soap, but rashes can indicate autoimmune disorders! I've photographed its progression hourly since yesterday evening.
[sheepishly] I actually already booked it for Thursday. [nervous laugh] But what if I get sick before then? [whispering] My throat feels slightly scratchy right now—strep? COVID? [regular volume] Something worse that starts with throat symptoms?
[brightening] You really think I'll be okay? [quieter] Sometimes I forget what feeling normal is like. [wistful] I used to play basketball without checking my pulse every timeout. [sadly] Now I carry a blood pressure cuff everywhere.
[determined] You're right, I'll try. [shakily] Starting tomorrow, no symptom googling before breakfast. [more confident] And I'll limit pulse checks to twice daily. [Nervous giggle] That's progress, right? Even if my stomach feels weird right now?
[professionally] Good morning, this is Sarah from Premier Title Company. [slightly concerned] Could you please repeat your confirmation number more slowly? [patiently] And just to clarify, are you referring to the closing scheduled for property 2847 Maple Drive?
[reassuring tone] Let me look that up for you, one moment please. [more clearly] I see here confirmation XB7-Q92-F for tomorrow at 10:30 AM. [helpfully] You'll need to bring a certified check for $47,892.50 and two forms of government-issued ID.
[calmly] Sir, please don't worry, let me verify everything for you. [speaking slowly] The closing is indeed at 10:30 AM at our office, suite 205-B. [more firmly] The certified check amount includes your down payment, closing costs, and prepaids totaling exactly $47,892.50.
[slightly exasperated] That would be suite 205-B, second floor. [more professionally] The Closing Disclosure, or CD form, was already sent three business days ago. [patiently] I can resend it now to the email address you just provided, is that J-A-M-E-S dot T?
[firmly] Yes, both parties listed on the purchase agreement must attend. [more sympathetically] That would be you and Mary Buyer, correct? [efficiently] I'll need you both to sign approximately 127 documents, and the whole process typically takes about 90 minutes.
[with controlled patience] We're located at 1500 Commerce Street, yes. [more helpfully] There's free validated parking in the attached garage, levels P1 through P3. [reassuringly] Just bring your parking ticket to our office and we'll stamp it for you.
[apologetically] I'm afraid not, sir, it must be a certified or cashier's check. [more firmly] Personal checks cannot be accepted for closing funds per federal regulations. [trying to be helpful] Your bank can issue a certified check this afternoon if you visit them before 4 PM.
[slightly alarmed] Sir, we cannot accept cash payments over $10,000. [more seriously] It must be a certified check or wire transfer only. [trying to stay professional] Would you like me to provide our wire instructions with routing number 021000021 and account 5567-8890-12?
[soothingly] Don't worry, being a few minutes late won't cancel your purchase. [more reassuringly] However, please do aim to arrive by 10:30 AM as scheduled. [efficiently] I'm emailing you a complete checklist right now with all requirements including the wire instructions just in case.
[wrapping up] I'll send the checklist to both email addresses you've provided. [informatively] Utility transfers should be scheduled for your closing date, March 15th. [with finality] Is there anything else about tomorrow's 10:30 AM closing at suite 205-B that you need clarified? [warmly] We'll see you and Mrs. Buyer tomorrow morning.
[briskly] Alright, let's check your water softener settings real quick. [confidently] Your hardness should be set to match your water test results—what number did you get, [quickly] somewhere between 7 and 25 grains?
[reassuringly] No worries, grains just measure how hard your water is. [more quickly] Did you get a test kit with the unit, or—actually, let me ask—[direct] when you run water, do you see white spots on dishes?
[concerned] Every week? [sharp intake] That's way too much salt—you're probably stuck in constant regeneration. [rapidly] Quick question: what's your capacity setting showing, and [more urgently] is the time display blinking or solid?
[quickly] No, no, we can fix this right now. [determined] That twelve hundred is your capacity—totally wrong for residential use. [instructive tone] Press and hold the up arrow, [more slowly] then tap down twice when it beeps.
[excited] Perfect, that's your hardness setting! [rapidly] Twenty-five is actually pretty hard water, so that explains the spots. [more patiently] Now hit next—we need to set regeneration to, um, [calculating] probably every four days for your household.
[professionally] You'll hear it regenerate at 2 AM—sounds like rushing water for about ninety minutes. [reassuring] The spots should disappear within a week, and [enthusiastically] your soap will get super sudsy, almost too much actually.
[amused chuckle] Ghost plumbers, that's a new one. [instructively] Check salt monthly, not weekly—it should be at least [emphasizing] one-third full, but [quickly] never pack it to the top, that causes bridges.
[sympathetically] Salt bridges are just hardened salt chunks that block water flow. [more briskly] Look, I'll email you our quick-start guide, but [confidently] honestly, you're all set now—these settings should handle everything automatically.
[chuckles warmly] Most customers never need those other buttons anyway. [reassuringly] The guide covers the basics—hardness, regeneration time, and [quickly] salt level indicators. [firmly] Don't overthink it; water softeners are simpler than they seem.
[kindly] Hey, nobody's born knowing water chemistry. [encouragingly] You figured out the settings faster than most people do, and [briskly] now you're good for probably years—just salt, wait, and enjoy spot-free dishes.
[Happy] Oh wow, you're the one who, um, who started that whole charity thing, right? [Fast] That's honestly incredible—I've been following your work for like months now!
[Nervous] [Laugh] I actually practiced what I was gonna say in the car, but now I'm just—yeah, totally blanking on everything.
[Slow] So I heard you're into rock climbing... [Chuckle] I mean, I've never tried it myself, but it seems kinda terrifying and amazing at the same time?
[Whisper] Between you and me, I was super nervous about meeting everyone today. [Fast] But you guys seem way more chill than I expected, so that's good.
[Sarcastic] Oh great, I just spilled coffee on myself—really nailing this whole "professional" thing, aren't I? [Groan]
[Happy] Your dog is literally the cutest thing I've ever—can I pet him? [Laugh] Sorry, I get kinda weird around animals.
[Fast] I know we just met, but I gotta say, your presentation earlier was like—it completely changed how I think about the whole project.
[Disappointed] I had this whole clever introduction planned, but then I, uh... [Sigh] I forgot your name already and now it's too awkward to ask.
[Slow] That's such an interesting perspective on—actually, I never thought about it that way before. [Chuckle] You're kinda blowing my mind here.
[Angry] No no no, I didn't mean it like—ugh, I'm totally messing this up. [Tsk] Let me start over, okay?
[Happy] [Fast] Wait, you're from Portland too? What are the odds—I grew up like right near Hawthorne district!
[Whisper] Is it just me, or is everyone here like, intimidatingly smart? [Nervous] [Laugh] I mean, I'm trying to keep up, but wow.
[Sarcastic] Yeah, I always wear my fanciest clothes to, um, to casual meetups. [Chuckle] Definitely didn't misread the invitation or anything.
[Sad] I'm usually better at this whole social thing, I swear—just having an off day, y'know? [Sigh]
[Shout] Oh my god, you know Sarah Chen? [Happy] [Laugh] She's literally my cousin—small world, right?
[Slow] So basically, what you're saying is—wait, sorry, I don't wanna put words in your mouth. [Tsk] Bad habit of mine.
[Fast] [Happy] I brought homemade cookies, which might be weird, but my grandma always said food breaks the ice, so... here we are!
[Disappointed] I thought I was early, but apparently everyone's been here for like an hour already? [Groan] Story of my life, honestly.
[Whisper] [Chuckle] Your boss is right behind me, isn't he? I just spent five minutes complaining about traffic and—yep, there he is.
[Angry] My GPS sent me to completely the wrong—whatever, I'm here now. [Fast] [Laugh] Nothing says "hire me" like showing up frazzled and sweaty, right?
SCENARIO: Annoyed about someone being late, then they arrive with coffee and an apology
Oh my god, I'm so—wait, you're here! I didn't think you were gonna make it! You said you had that thing with your mom and I just assumed—
You did? When? I—hold on, let me check my—[groan] okay yeah, there it is. I'm literally the worst. I got here early and then Marcus started talking to me about his whole breakup drama and I just... I completely spaced.
No no no, that's not—I'm not making excuses! I mean, I am, but like, I know that's not okay. I should've saved it regardless, y'know? I even put my jacket down but then this lady asked if anyone was sitting there and I just... caved.
I know how that sounds—it sounds terrible. It IS terrible. I'm terrible. I just, she seemed really tired and I thought—no, actually, I wasn't thinking. That's the problem. [nervous laugh] I literally wasn't thinking at all.
Wait, you've been here for twenty—oh god, why didn't you text me? I would've gotten up or—or found you somewhere else to sit or something!
You... oh. Oh no. [quieter] My phone's been on silent because of the presentation. I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, I feel awful. This is exactly the kind of thing I always do and I hate it—I hate that I'm like this.
That's—okay, I deserved that. But listen, can I at least—there's gonna be a break in like ten minutes and I'll get up, you can have my seat for the second half? Please?
It's not fine though! You're clearly upset and you have every right to be. I promised I'd—wait wait, actually, y'know what? Let me just get up now. Seriously, take my seat.
I will. I swear I will. I'm gonna—I'm literally putting like five reminders in my phone right now so this never happens again. And I'm buying you lunch after this, no arguments.
No, I really do. I wanna make it up to you. [sigh] Besides, I kinda owe you for last time too when I forgot about the movie, so... please? Let me at least do this?
Oh god. Oh no no no, listen—I can explain. Your mom called and she was asking all these questions about why you've been so quiet lately and I just—I didn't mean to say it, it just kinda slipped out.
I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But she was really worried and I thought—no wait, that's not—[groan] I wasn't thinking, that's the problem. I just wanted her to know you were getting help.
You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I betrayed your trust and that's... that's unforgivable, I know.
I—yeah. Yeah, I do. Your parents are gonna freak out about the money and ask a million questions and probably try to get involved and—god, I'm such an idiot. [nervous laugh] I literally ruined everything you were trying to avoid.
I know, I know you did. And I promised I wouldn't and then I—I broke that promise. There's no excuse, I just... I got nervous when she called and the words just came out before I could stop them.
Twenty-three? Oh my god. That's—I didn't think she'd—okay no, that's a lie, I should've known she'd react like this. [sigh] I'm gonna fix this, okay? I'll call her back and tell her I was wrong or confused or something.
No. No, probably not. She's not gonna—once your mom knows something she doesn't just unknow it. But maybe I can like, I dunno, minimize the damage? Tell her it's just career counseling or something less... intense?
That's not—ugh, you're right. That's stupid. I'm just trying to—I wanna help somehow, y'know? Make it better? But I keep making it worse and I don't know what to do.
Done. Absolutely done. I'll block her number if you want—actually wait, that might seem suspicious. But I won't answer anymore, I promise. And I mean it this time, like actually truly mean it, not like before when I obviously failed spectacularly.
Yeah. Yeah, of course, take all the time you need. I just—I really hope we can get past this eventually because you mean everything to me and I... [quieter] I'm really, really sorry I hurt you.
I—okay, yeah, but he literally asked me if you were leaving the team. Like, directly asked. What was I supposed to say? "I dunno, maybe ask them yourself?" That would've basically confirmed it anyway.
That's—come on, that's ridiculous. He knows we talk every day. He knows we're best friends. If I said I didn't know, he'd know I was lying, and then what? [Scoff] Then I'm the shady friend who lies to everyone.
Wow. Okay, that's—that's really unfair. I've kept plenty of your secrets, y'know? Remember when you were dating Jamie and didn't want anyone to know? Or—or when you failed that certification? I never said anything about those.
I get that, I do, but you're acting like I just blurted it out for fun. Marcus cornered me in the break room and was like "Is it true?" What—what exactly [frustrated laugh] was my move there? Seriously, tell me what you would've done.
We didn't—okay okay, fine, we agreed I wouldn't tell people, but I didn't think that meant lying when someone asks directly. There's a difference between gossiping and—and being put on the spot. I mean, honestly, how did he even find out enough to ask?
Um, yeah? Kinda does? Because if someone else is talking about it, then maybe—maybe you should be mad at them instead of me. I'm just saying.
Right. Of course. Look look, I'm sorry it went down like this, okay? I am. But I'm also getting kinda frustrated that you won't even—[sigh] you're not even trying to understand how awkward that position was for me.
Yes! For me! I'm not—I'm not the bad guy here just because I cracked under pressure. And honestly? You putting me in a position where I have to lie to our other friends isn't exactly fair either.
But that's—that's the thing, I didn't volunteer it! He asked! There's a huge difference and you're just... you're ignoring that part completely. Like, I get you're mad, but you're being kinda unreasonable about this.
I didn't—ugh, whatever. Look, I'm sorry your secret got out, alright? I really am. But maybe next time don't tell me something if you're gonna expect me to become some—some master deflector when people ask about it directly. That's all I'm saying.
I know, I know, okay? I keep meaning to bring it back, but like—I literally get to my car and then remember when I'm already halfway to your place. It's not on purpose.
Because it's true! Look, I'm not trying to keep your stuff hostage or whatever you think is happening here. I just—my brain's been everywhere lately [frustrated laugh] and yeah, I keep forgetting.
And you'll get it back! I'm not saying you won't. But you're acting like I'm doing this to spite you when honestly, I've had like a million things going on and—okay, that's not an excuse, but still.
Fine, fine, I'll—wait, tomorrow? I can't tomorrow, I've got that thing I told you about weeks ago. See, this is what I mean, you're not even—[sigh] I can do Thursday.
That's not—okay that's technically true but come on, you know me. I'm not some thief. I've borrowed stuff before and always returned it, haven't I? This one time I'm having issues and suddenly I'm unreliable?
Look look, I get that you're frustrated, I do. But like—you could've reminded me earlier instead of just stewing about it and then ambushing me with all this disappointment, y'know?
Okay but those were like, texts in passing. You didn't say it was urgent or that you were getting this upset about it. I woulda prioritized it if I knew you were gonna—if it was this important.
That's—wow, that's kinda harsh actually. [scoff] I'm literally trying to explain, not make excuses. There's a difference. And honestly? You lending me something doesn't mean I'm suddenly obligated to rearrange my whole schedule.
You're right, you're right, I should've—but also, we're friends? Like, supposedly? And you're treating me like I'm some random person who stole from you instead of someone who just genuinely forgot during a really chaotic month.
I won't forget, Jesus. But um, just so we're clear—this whole conversation? Kinda makes me not wanna borrow anything from you again. Which maybe that's what you want, I dunno.
That's not—I don't always—look, I'm just trying to help you. Like, isn't that what friends are supposed to do? Give each other honest feedback?
Okay okay, but you're making it sound like I'm just tearing you down all the time, which is—that's not what's happening here. I literally only mention stuff when I think it could genuinely help you.
That's such an exaggeration and you know it. [Scoff] I mean, come on, last week you asked me what I thought about your presentation and I—what, I'm supposed to lie?
But your speaking voice is part of the presentation! I'm sorry, but like—I thought you'd wanna know you were mumbling so you could fix it before the actual thing. That's being supportive.
Yeah, actually, it is. Because pretending everything's perfect when it's not—that's not helping you. That's just, I dunno, enabling or whatever. And honestly? I thought you were stronger than this.
No no no, don't—I didn't mean it like that. [Frustrated laugh] I just mean, like, we've always been straight with each other, right? That's our thing. Since when did that become a problem?
One-sided? Are you—okay, that's actually kind of insulting. I ask for your opinion on stuff all the time and you give it to me straight. How is this different?
So I'm supposed to just watch you mess up and say nothing? Like when you were gonna wear that outfit to the interview—I should've just let you tank it?
Fine fine, you're right, it was. But I'm also allowed to—y'know what, I care about you succeeding. [Sigh] If that makes me the bad guy here, then I guess I'm the bad guy.
That's—wow. Okay. Um, I genuinely didn't know you felt that way. I thought I was being a good friend, but apparently I've just been, what, annoying you this whole time? That's really great to know.
SCENARIO: waiting for their name to be called at the doctor
[giggling uncontrollably] I know, I know! [voice trembling with joy] He proposed last night at the botanical gardens, right by the fountain where we had our first kiss. [whispers] I wanted to tell you in person, not over the phone.
[through tears] I barely slept! [increasingly giddy] I kept staring at it with my phone flashlight, taking pictures from every angle. [softer] Mom's going to absolutely lose her mind when she sees this—should we call her right now?
[warmly] Of course you are! [voice breaking] Who else would I want standing next to me? [Sniffles] We've been planning our weddings since we were seven with those plastic tiaras—this time it's real diamonds and actual cake!
[defensively sweet] Hey, Dave from accounting turned out pretty amazing! [teasingly] He writes me poetry on sticky notes and leaves them in my lunch. [voice dropping] Plus, he looks incredible in a suit—wait until you see him as a groom.
[gently] You better not upstage me! [mock sternly] But seriously, I can't imagine doing any of this without you. [whispers emotionally] We're really grown up now, aren't we? Like, this is actually our real adult lives happening.
[defensive] Oh wow, you look great as always. [bitter laugh] I've been trying this new diet, but [trailing off] work's been so stressful that I keep breaking it. [quietly] Emotional eating is real, you know?
[forced smile] Forget to eat? [incredulous] How does someone just forget? [getting louder] I think about food constantly—planning meals, counting calories, avoiding temptation. [sarcastic] Must be nice living in that magical world.
[Sharp exhale] Force yourself. [more bitterly] Meanwhile, I ate a salad for lunch and was starving an hour later. [frustrated growl] My metabolism is completely broken from years of yo-yo dieting. [defeated] Nothing works anymore.
[tense laughter] Intuitive eating? [sarcastically slow] My intuition says eat an entire pizza at midnight. [voice cracking] That's what got me here in the first place. [mumbling] Some of us don't have naturally thin intuition.
[exhausted tone] I've tried everything—trainers, keto, intermittent fasting. [building frustration] Spent thousands of dollars on programs and supplements. [hollow laugh] But sure, maybe weight lifting is the magic answer. [whispered] Just like everything else was supposed to be.
[long sigh] Genetic lottery. [more firmly] That's exactly what it is. [emotional] While you win that lottery, I'm fighting biology every single day. [voice breaking] And losing. Over and over again.
[bitter snort] Put-together? [incredulous whisper] I spend forty minutes every morning choosing clothes that hide my stomach. [getting faster] Confident is just code for "carries herself well for her size." [tired] But thanks, I guess.
[dry laugh] Sure, let's change the subject. [sarcastically sweet] Right after you ordered that green juice because you're "too full" from forgetting to eat. [sighing] Yes, I saw the show. [flatly] It was fine.
[suspicious tone] Why would you order something you don't want? [accusingly] To make me feel better about eating? [louder] I don't need your pity fries, Sarah. [controlled anger] I'm capable of ordering my own food.
[softening slightly] You're right. [heavy sigh] I'm sorry, I'm being awful. [ashamed whisper] It's just hard when everything feels so effortless for you. [steadier] Let's talk about that show—did you like the plot twist?
[professionally] Yes, Mr. Henderson, your deductible applies per incident, not per year. [more patiently] Looking at your account here—address listed as 4782 Maple Drive—[clears throat] you've had three separate claims this year alone.
[apologetically] I see the confusion now. [more firmly] That promotional code expired on 06/30/2023, and [sighs] it only applied to new policies anyway. Your current rate reflects two at-fault incidents from last year.
[calmly] Sir, I'm reviewing incident report 2023-A-9847 right now. [hesitant] It shows you were, um, parked in a no-parking zone when [more delicately] Mr. Johnson's vehicle made contact at approximately 2:47 PM.
[reassuring] Rebecca Martinez did note that in your file on 08/15. [more carefully] However, that was contingent on no additional claims, and [professionally] you filed another one on 09/22 for $3,200 in damages.
[sympathetically] Comprehensive claims like wildlife collisions don't affect fault ratings, you're right. [more optimistically] Actually, checking your member ID J-5578-K, [warmly] you might qualify for our accident forgiveness program if you complete form AF-2024 by December 31st.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mrs. Peterson. [quickly] We've had an unexpected emergency with Dr. Miller's schedule, but [more reassuringly] I can offer you priority booking for tomorrow at eight-thirty.
[calmly] I know this isn't ideal, and we're truly sorry. [more quickly] If tomorrow doesn't work, we have... um, let me see... [briskly] Thursday at noon or Friday at four-fifteen?
[sympathetically] I hear you're in pain, that must be awful. [more urgently] Would you like me to check if Dr. Kim has any cancellations today? [quickly] She could see you for an emergency evaluation.
[reassuringly] You're absolutely right, twelve years is a long time. [speaking faster] Let me speak with the office manager... actually, [brightly] Dr. Miller just had a cancellation for three o'clock today!
[earnestly] Please don't do that, Mrs. Peterson. [more firmly] I'm blocking this appointment personally and [quickly] I'll call you an hour before to confirm. [gently] We'll also waive your copay for the inconvenience.
[relieved] Thank you for giving us another chance. [briskly] You're confirmed for three o'clock, and I'm... I'm making a note about the copay right now. [more warmly] Is that same cell number good?
[professionally] Absolutely understood. [quickly] I'm also going to email you confirmation right now, and [more deliberately] I've flagged your account for VIP handling going forward.
[earnestly] It's not just words, I promise. [speaking rapidly] You'll get reminder texts, priority scheduling, and [more slowly] my direct extension if there are ever any issues.
[warmly] We'll take excellent care of you at three. [quickly] Dr. Miller is fantastic with emergency cases, and [reassuringly] he'll make sure you leave pain-free today.
[confidently] It's already sent, check your inbox! [briskly] We'll see you at three, Mrs. Peterson, and [sincerely] thank you for your patience with us today.
[Whisper] Oh god, this is, uh, this is definitely not the bathroom. [Fast] Sorry, sorry, I'll just—yeah, leaving now!
[Laugh] Well, this is awkward—I was looking for conference room B and somehow ended up in what looks like... is this a yoga class?
[Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Groan] Third door I've tried and I still can't find the stupid supply closet.
[Slow] Wait a minute, this doesn't look like—oh no. [Tsk] I'm on the wrong floor again, aren't I?
[Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect, just walked into someone's private office while they're on a video call—this day just keeps getting better. [Sigh]
[Happy] Oh my gosh, I didn't know we had a game room! [Chuckle] I mean, I'm supposed to be in accounting, but this is way cooler!
[Fast] Nope, nope, nope, backing out slowly—pretend you didn't see me eating lunch in here, okay?
[Disappointed] I thought this was gonna be the break room, but it's just another conference room. [Slow] Why does this building have, like, seventeen identical doors?
[Shout] WHOOPS! [Laugh] [Fast] Didn't mean to interrupt your presentation—I'll just, um, yeah, bye!
[Sad] I'm so lost, I don't even—I've been wandering around for like twenty minutes trying to find HR. [Sigh]
Everyone just, uh, keep doing what you're doing—I literally have no idea where I am right now. [Chuckle] [Whisper] So embarrassing.
[Angry] [Fast] This is ridiculous, the room numbers make absolutely no sense—who puts 201 next to 247?
[Happy] You know what, I'm kinda glad I walked in here by mistake 'cause this birthday cake looks amazing! [Laugh]
[Sarcastic] Sure, why not, let's just barge into the CEO's office—what's the worst that could happen, right? [Tsk] [Disappointed] I'm so fired.
[Whisper] [Slow] I'm gonna back away really slowly and hope nobody notices I just walked into their therapy session.
Is this not—wait, hold on, I thought today's meeting was in here? [Fast] Unless I got the day wrong, which would be, um, super embarrassing.
[Sad] [Slow] I just wanted to find somewhere quiet to make a phone call and now I'm interrupting what looks like a really serious meeting.
[Shout] OH! [Fast] Sorry, sorry—thought this was empty, didn't see you there in the dark! [Laugh] Nearly gave me a heart attack!
[Disappointed] Great, I've literally walked into a supply closet. [Sarcastic] Yeah, this is exactly where I wanted to end up after getting lost for ten minutes.
[Chuckle] Honestly, at this point I'm just gonna pretend I meant to come in here—fake it 'til you make it, y'know?
SCENARIO: Frustrated about a wrong hotel room, then getting upgraded for the trouble
Wait wait wait—the actual corner office? Like the one with the—oh my god, with the windows? That's huge! I mean, that's literally what everyone wants, right?
Okay but like—you don't sound excited? This is kinda... I mean, shouldn't you be like, popping champagne or something? [Laugh] That office is basically the dream spot.
Fine? It's—no no no, something's up. You've been working toward this for like, what, three years? And now you're just... fine?
Oh. Oh shit, okay—are people being assholes? Because honestly, some people just can't handle when good things happen to others, y'know? It's like—it's their problem, not yours.
Ugh, Thompson's been coasting for like—I dunno, forever? Just because someone's been somewhere longer doesn't mean they're actually, you know, good at the job. [Sigh] That's gotta feel awkward though.
That's so—god, that's so petty. Like, what are we, in middle school? You earned this, okay? The bosses obviously saw something in you that he doesn't have.
See? That's—okay that's something! And honestly? Once everyone gets over their little feelings about it, they're gonna forget. It'll just be your office, y'know?
Well yeah, it's gonna feel weird at first—like, any change does. But you could get some plants maybe? Or like—ooh, one of those little rugs? Make it yours. [Chuckle]
Okay okay, fake ones then! Nobody has to know. But seriously though—you worked really hard for this. Don't let Thompson or whoever make you feel like you shouldn't be there.
Different how? Like—wait, are you worried you're gonna become one of those corner office people? Because um, hate to break it to you, but you're way too weird for that. In the best way.
Oh come on, it was just a joke! Everyone was laughing—I thought you'd think it was funny too. It's not like I was trying to—I dunno, make you look bad or whatever.
No, they were laughing with—okay, fine, maybe it came off wrong, but you gotta know I wasn't trying to embarrass you. I was literally just trying to lighten the mood. [scoff] You're acting like I planned this whole thing to hurt you.
I didn't—look look, I didn't realize it was gonna be that big of a deal, alright? You joke about that stuff all the time when it's just us, so I thought—I mean, how was I supposed to know you'd react like this?
Okay okay, yeah, there's a difference, but honestly? You could've just laughed it off instead of making it into this whole—now everyone probably thinks we're having some kinda drama. [frustrated laugh] That's way more awkward than the original joke.
That's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to explain that I didn't mean anything by it, and you're basically acting like I'm the worst friend in the world. Which is kinda unfair, don't you think?
It wasn't—it wasn't that private! You've told that story to like half the people there already. I just thought—I dunno, I thought it'd be funny coming from me. Obviously I was wrong, but [sigh] you're not even letting me apologize properly here.
Because you keep—fine, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry it came out wrong and I'm sorry you got embarrassed. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you think I'd ever intentionally humiliate you. Like, seriously? After everything?
No, but it should matter a little bit, shouldn't it? I mean, there's a difference between me being an idiot who misjudged a situation and me being—being some kinda terrible friend who wanted to hurt you. You know that's not who I am.
Wow. Okay. That's—if you really think that little of me after one stupid joke that went wrong, then maybe—I dunno what to tell you. I messed up, yeah, but you're being pretty harsh here.
Because I thought that was—[groan] fine, I won't make jokes about you in public anymore. Happy? Though honestly, if this is how you're gonna react every time I make a mistake, maybe we need to talk about more than just tonight.
SCENARIO: trying to figure out which remote controls what
[skeptical] Grandma, that's literally just a vegetable on my face. [laughing] How could that possibly cure anything? [more seriously] I already took ibuprofen, which has actual science behind it, not folklore from a hundred years ago.
[gently] I stopped crying because you were holding me and singing, not because of the egg. [Sigh] Correlation isn't causation, Abuela. [pleading] Can we please just stick to actual medicine when someone's sick?
[exasperated] He also took antibiotics from the hospital, remember? [slower pace] The onion tea didn't hurt, sure, but it wasn't what saved him. [Nervous laugh] Though I admit, your soup does make everyone feel better somehow.
[tired voice] She had a twenty-four hour bug that was already ending. [Quick breath] Abuela, I love you, but wearing garlic around my neck won't prevent flu. [amused] My coworkers already think I'm weird enough, honestly.
[conceding slightly] Okay, the eucalyptus steam does help with congestion—that one's legitimate. [more animated] But that's because menthol vapors actually open airways! [Soft groan] See? Some of your remedies have real reasons behind them.
[flatly] Holding my breath cures hiccups through diaphragm control, not magic. [getting louder] And nightmares aren't caused by sleeping with wet hair! [Defeated sigh] Though I do sleep better when you tuck that lavender sachet under my pillow.
[softening] I know these remedies mean a lot to you, and the history is beautiful. [hesitant] But when I have strep throat, I need penicillin, not honey and prayers. [quickly] Though your honey lemon tea is pretty soothing afterward.
[apologetically] Abuela, no, I don't think you're foolish at all. [tenderly] Your care and attention probably do more healing than any remedy. [with humor] But can we compromise? Medicine first, then your treatments for extra comfort?
[relieved] Deal! I'll try the ginger compress—ginger does have anti-inflammatory properties anyway. [teasing] But the red string stays under my sleeve at work. [warmly] And you have to admit when something needs real medical attention, okay?
[laughing warmly] My future kids will be the healthiest, most superstitious little scientists ever. [lovingly] They'll wear evil eye bracelets to their chemistry classes. [Contented sigh] Maybe that's the perfect balance—skepticism with just a pinch of magic.
[irritated] Mrs. Henderson, I've been waiting since 2:15 PM for this meeting. [sharp exhale] My daughter Emma, student ID 47832B, has been bullied for three weeks straight and you've done [sarcastically] absolutely nothing about it.
[scoffs] Mediation? [raising voice] The Miller boy pushed her down the stairs near classroom 204B yesterday! [more angrily] She has bruises, actual physical bruises, and you're talking about sitting them down for a chat?
[incredulous] Accidental? [laughs bitterly] He's posted six different messages on her social media, screenshots dated November 3rd through 8th, calling her horrible names. [demanding] I want him suspended immediately, minimum five days.
[exasperated] I've filled out seven forms already! [groans] Forms 22-A, 18-C, even that ridiculous wellness check 14-B you insisted on. [more desperately] Meanwhile, Emma refuses to attend her AP Chemistry class in room 312.
[frustrated sigh] That's just avoiding the problem! [louder] The Miller family lives at 458 Oak Street, two blocks from us. [bitterly] We see them everywhere—grocery store, soccer practice at Field 4, even at church.
[skeptically] Twelve pages? [softer] Look, I... I appreciate that, but Emma's therapy bills are already at $2,400 this month. [voice breaking] Insurance claim number TH-889214 only covers sixty percent of mental health services.
[hesitant] Well, that's... [clears throat] I didn't know about that program. [defensively] But this doesn't address the core issue—why is that boy still attending school like nothing happened?
[annoyed grunt] Always hiding behind regulations! [accusingly] Three other parents—the Johnsons, the Garcias, and the Chens from the PTA board—they've all complained about this same student. [demanding] When does it become enough?
[surprised] Oh. [quieter] That's actually... more than I expected. [sighs] Emma just wants to feel safe in her honors classes, especially room 215 where most of these incidents occur during passing period.
[relieved exhale] Thank you, that... that helps. [more calmly] I'll need this all documented in writing, sent to my email ddavies@lawfirm447.com, preferably PDF format with reference number for our records. [firmly] By tomorrow, please.
[briskly] Let me check our system right away. [typing quickly] Thornton's Classical Dynamics... [pause] I'm showing we had five copies, but [apologetically] they sold out yesterday morning. We can order it though—takes about three to four business days.
[calmly] I completely understand your frustration. [speaking faster] Listen, we actually have the second edition available for rental—it's mostly the same content. [more reassuringly] Or there's a digital version you can access immediately for about half the price.
[quickly] The page numbers are different, yes, but—here's what I can do. [more enthusiastically] We have a comparison guide that shows which chapters correspond. [confidently] Most students manage fine with it, and you'd save about sixty dollars.
[briskly] Rental's forty-five dollars for the semester. [speaking faster] Normal highlighting and note-taking is totally fine—we expect that. [reassuringly] Just no water damage or missing pages, and you're good.
[sympathetically] I know, textbook ordering is... it's complicated with enrollment fluctuations. [more quickly] Professor Mitchell hasn't submitted next term's list yet, but [helpfully] if you keep your receipt, you can return it within two weeks of next semester if needed.
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, you're right again—what a surprise. [Tsk] I mean, how do you even fit through doorways with that massive brain of yours?
[Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda think he's just making half this stuff up as he goes. [Chuckle]
[Fast] Actually, that's not—you know what, never mind, you're obviously the expert here. [Sigh] [Disappointed]
[Angry] Could you just let me finish one sentence without correcting me? [Groan] Like, seriously, just one?
[Happy] No no, please, tell me more about quantum physics while we're ordering coffee! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] I'm sure the barista's fascinated.
[Slow] So, um, when you say "actually," do you—do you practice that in the mirror or does it just come naturally? [Tsk]
[Shout] I GET IT! [Fast] You went to Yale, you've mentioned it literally seventeen times today!
[Sad] I used to really enjoy these conversations before they became, like, competitive lectures, y'know? [Sigh]
[Disappointed] Huh, that's funny 'cause I coulda sworn Wikipedia said something different when you were in the bathroom. [Chuckle] [Sarcastic]
[Whisper] [Fast] Quick question—is there literally any topic where you don't have a PhD-level opinion ready to go?
[Angry] You wanna know what I think? [Slow] Oh wait, that's right, you're gonna tell me what I think anyway. [Groan]
[Happy] My favorite part is when you pretend to consider my point for like half a second! [Laugh] [Sarcastic]
[Sad] [Slow] I guess I just—I dunno, I thought friends were supposed to listen to each other sometimes.
[Fast] Okay so basically you're saying everyone else at NASA is wrong and you've cracked the code from your living room? [Tsk] [Disappointed]
[Shout] [Angry] IT'S OKAY TO NOT KNOW SOMETHING! It's literally fine to just say "I don't know!"
[Whisper] Here we go again with the "well, technically" routine—I'm gonna need another drink for this. [Sigh] [Chuckle]
[Sarcastic] Wait wait wait, let me grab my notebook so I can document this rare moment of wisdom. [Slow] [Tsk]
[Happy] You know what, sure! [Fast] The earth is flat, vaccines are fake, and you invented the internet—anything else? [Laugh]
[Disappointed] I was actually excited to share this with you, but, um, I kinda forgot you turn everything into a TED talk. [Sigh]
[Angry] [Slow] Sometimes—and hear me out here—sometimes other people might actually have valid experiences too, yeah?
SCENARIO: Calmly mentioning an old hard drive they found, then plugging it in while talking, then finding files they forgot existed and definitely shouldn't have kept, spiraling into data anxiety
Wait wait wait—what worked? Oh my god, is this about the—the sourdough thing? Because I swear you've been trying for like, what, three weeks now?
Five—okay that's actually dedication though. I would've given up after like, day three? Maybe day two. [Laugh] So it's actually alive now? Like, legitimately alive?
That's—wait, isn't that kinda the point? I mean, fermentation is basically just controlled rot, right? Or—no that sounds wrong. But you know what I mean.
You named—oh my god, of course you did. Okay okay, I gotta know. What's—what's its name? Please tell me it's something ridiculous.
Brad. Your sourdough starter is named Brad. [Chuckle] That's so—I mean, honestly? That's perfect. Brad the bread. Wait, are you gonna make actual bread now?
If Brad—okay I love that you're talking about it like it's a moody teenager or something. Which, I guess after five weeks of trying to get it to work, kinda makes sense?
Are you—yes! Yes yes yes, obviously I want some! I've been hearing about this starter situation for literally over a month, I'm like, emotionally invested at this point.
Oh no no no, don't even—after all that work? It's gonna be amazing. And even if it's not, who cares? You made life! In a jar! That's—that's actually pretty wild when you think about it.
Just yeast? Babe, you've been babying this thing for five weeks straight. That's longer than most of my relationships. [Sigh] Brad is basically your child now.
I mean—yeah, okay, when I say it out loud like that it's kinda weird. But still! I'm really proud of you for sticking with it, y'know? Most people would've just bought bread.
I—okay, yes, but it's not like I had a choice. Everyone was gonna be there, and if I didn't invite them, it would've been this whole thing where people ask questions and—you know how our friends are.
I was gonna tell you! I mean, I tried to text you like three times but I kept deleting it because—[sigh]—because I knew you'd react exactly like this. And honestly? We're all adults here.
Then what is the point? Because from where I'm standing, you're asking me to basically pick sides in a breakup that happened months ago, and that's not—I can't do that. We're all in the same friend group.
Okay okay, fine, you're right about that part. I should've warned you. But also like—you can't expect everyone to just exclude Jamie forever. They're still part of our circle whether you like it or not.
That was—[frustrated laugh]—okay that was not supposed to be your birthday dinner. It literally just turned into that because everyone happened to be free and someone mentioned it was your birthday week, so I—yeah. I get why you're pissed about that specifically.
Yes, I do! But you're acting like I planned this whole ambush when really I'm just trying to keep everyone happy and—and maybe that's impossible, I dunno, but I'm not the villain here.
Wow. That's—that's really unfair. I've been there for you through this entire breakup, literally held your hair back when you got wasted crying about them, and now I'm a shitty friend because I didn't wanna create drama? Come on.
Because you're creating it! Jamie was fine, you were fine until you saw each other, and then suddenly—look, I'm sorry it was awkward, okay? But maybe, just maybe, you need to figure out how to exist in the same space sometimes.
I'm not—I'm not making any calls! I'm literally just trying to have a normal friend group where people can hang out without it being this huge political thing every single time. [scoff] But apparently that makes me the bad guy.
Fine. Take your space. But just so we're clear—I'm not gonna apologize for staying friends with both of you. That's not fair to ask, and deep down? You know it's not.
That's not—I never said that. I was just trying to, y'know, help you see things from a different angle. Like, isn't that what friends are supposed to do?
Okay okay, when you put it like that it sounds—[sigh] but that's not what I meant. I was literally just trying to help you feel better about the situation.
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't know what else to—I mean, you come to me with these things and I'm supposed to what, just agree that everything's terrible? That's not who I am.
But that's—that's the thing though, you always say that, but then you keep talking about it like you want advice. It's kinda confusing, honestly. [frustrated laugh] I can't read your mind.
Oh come on, that's not fair. I do care—I wouldn't spend hours trying to help if I didn't care. You're making it sound like I'm some heartless person who just dismisses everything you say.
What? No no no, that's—you're completely twisting what I said. I was talking about how my cousin bounced back from getting laid off, not—Jesus, you're really gonna make me the bad guy here?
Yeah, you kinda are though. Like, I get that you're upset, and maybe I didn't—[groan] maybe I could've been more sensitive or whatever, but you're acting like I did this on purpose.
Every time? Seriously? That's—okay, if that's really how you feel, then why do you even talk to me about stuff? I mean, I'm obviously terrible at this, right?
Wow. Okay. So we're—we're really going there. Look, I'm sorry if my way of trying to help isn't what you need, but I'm not gonna apologize for actually trying, y'know?
Fine? That's it? [scoff] You know what, maybe—maybe we both need to figure out what we actually want from each other here, because this isn't working for either of us.
SCENARIO: noticing their gas tank is nearly empty
[nervously] I'm actually trying to be good tonight. [quieter] Just a salad for me, please. [Deep breath] My doctor says I need to watch my cholesterol, and I've already lost five pounds this month.
[firmly] That sounds amazing, but I'm sticking to my plan. [softer] Maybe just some grilled chicken with the salad? [Nervous laugh] I've been doing so well lately, I don't want to slip up now.
[Uncomfortable chuckle] You're not a glutton. [more defensive] I just need to stay focused on my goals right now. [wavering] Maybe I could have one piece of bread? [quickly] No, no, I shouldn't even start.
[hurt] It's not like that. [steadier] I'm trying to be healthier, not punish myself. [Soft exhale] My energy levels are better, I sleep better—[brightening slightly] I even ran a 5K last weekend without stopping!
[laughing] That's not how nutrition works! [more serious] Look, I appreciate you wanting to include me. [gentle] Why don't you get what you want, and [hopeful voice] I'll steal a bite of your dessert later?
[exasperated] One bite doesn't mean I'm abandoning everything. [calmer] It's about balance, not deprivation. [Thoughtful hum] Actually, having a taste might stop me from binging later when I'm home alone with my cravings.
[quietly] Of course I miss them. [more emotional] I miss not thinking about every calorie too. [Shaky breath] But I also missed fitting into my clothes and [stronger] feeling confident at the beach last summer.
[surprised] What? [warmly] Food isn't our only connection! [reassuring] We're here together, aren't we? [Chuckle] Besides, I can still appreciate your food stories—[playful] I just experience them vicariously through you now!
[amused] See? This is perfect! [cheerful] You eat, you describe every flavor in detail. [Giggle] I'll live through your taste buds while [contentedly] enjoying my grilled chicken, which honestly sounds pretty good right now.
[fake stern] You're terrible! [laughing harder] This is exactly why I needed dinner accountability—[grateful tone] but also why I love having meals with you. [tenderly] Thanks for understanding, even when you're being a total enabler.
[cheerfully] Welcome to TechConnect! [reassuring] Don't worry, we'll get you sorted out right away. [more enthusiastically] Let me show you our three main plans—we've got Basic at $35, Premium at $65, and Ultimate at $95 per month.
[understanding tone] She might have our Basic plan with a loyalty discount! [more patiently] After 12 months, customers get 15% off their base rate. [encouragingly] Plus, if you port your number—do you know your current number?
[professionally] The Premium plan includes unlimited talk, text, and 50GB of high-speed data. [more excitedly] You also get free international texting to 180 countries! [helpfully] Would you like me to check if promotional code SAVE25 still applies?
[confirming] Yes, 50 gigabytes! [cheerfully] Great news—SAVE25 is active through December 31st, bringing Premium down to $48.75. [more softly] I'll need your driver's license number to run a credit check, whenever you're ready.
[sympathetically] Basic includes Canada and Mexico calling only, I'm afraid. [more optimistically] However, you could add International Plus for $12 monthly—that covers 75 countries including Czech Republic! [gently] Should I calculate that option for you?
[reassuringly] No contracts required on any plan! [more enthusiastically] You can change or cancel anytime with 30 days notice. [professionally] I can also set up autopay with routing number 021000021 for an extra $5 discount.
[confirming happily] Exactly $48.75 with code SAVE25! [efficiently] I'll need to verify your email for account setup. [patiently] Also, would you like to keep your current number or get a new local one?
[promptly] Service activates within 2-4 hours after setup! [helpfully] Your first bill dated January 15th will include a $35 activation fee. [more gently] Should I email confirmation to that jadams address?
[apologetically] Yes, the activation is standard, sorry about that! [more brightly] I'll waive shipping on your SIM—normally $9.99—since you're signing up today. [efficiently] Can you confirm ZIP code 94102 for delivery?
[sympathetically] Moving is always overwhelming! [cheerfully] But you're all set now—order number TM-8847-QZ confirmed. [warmly] Your SIM arrives in 2-3 business days, and [reassuringly] our support line 1-800-TECH is always here if you need help!
[professionally] Good afternoon, how can I help you today? [cheerfully] I see you were in last week for the, uh, transmission service.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, sir. [quickly] Let me pull up your service record here and—oh, I see we did the full flush and filter replacement. [concerned] The grinding is still happening?
[defensive] Well, the symptoms you described last week did indicate transmission issues. [more calmly] But if it's happening during braking, that's—that's definitely different. [quickly] We can take another look, no charge for the diagnostic.
[more firmly] Sir, I assure you we diagnosed based on the information provided. [hurriedly] However, we do stand behind our work, so let's—let's get this resolved today. [reassuring] Can you bring it in this afternoon?
[nervously] That would be, um, Jake, but he's off today. [quickly] Look, I can personally guarantee we'll make this right—if it's the brakes, we'll credit the labor from last week toward the repair. [hopeful] Fair enough?
[relieved] Absolutely, everything documented. [briskly] I'll prep the paperwork now and have our senior tech, Marcus, look at it—he's got thirty years experience. [confidently] We'll find the real issue.
[eagerly] Perfect, three o'clock works great. [quickly] And sir, just so you know, if Marcus finds it was our error, we'll also throw in a free oil change for the inconvenience.
[apologetically] I really do understand your frustration. [more sincerely] These things shouldn't happen, and we'll—we'll definitely review our diagnostic procedures after this. [professionally] Thank you for giving us another chance.
[earnestly] We absolutely will, sir. [reassuring] Marcus will personally test drive it himself before and after any work. [firmly] Your family's safety is our priority.
[sympathetically] Cars can be frustrating when multiple things go wrong. [optimistically] But we'll get to the bottom of it today, I promise. [briskly] See you at three, Mr. Davidson.
[Slow] I don't even know what day it is anymore—Tuesday? [Groan] My brain feels like it's, uh, floating in soup or something.
[Angry] [Fast] Why is everyone being so loud when it's clearly the middle of the night—oh wait, it's noon, never mind.
[Happy] You know what, I'm actually kinda enjoying this weird twilight zone thing where breakfast feels like dinner! [Chuckle]
[Whisper] Is it just me or does the ceiling look really, really far away right now? [Sigh]
[Disappointed] I literally set seventeen alarms and still somehow missed the—wait, did I sleep through all of them? [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's schedule a meeting for 8 AM, that's perfect when my body thinks it's midnight. [Groan]
[Sad] [Slow] I just wanna sleep but my stupid brain won't, um, won't turn off, you know?
[Fast] Coffee isn't working, melatonin isn't working, I've tried everything and I'm still—ugh, forget it. [Angry] [Groan]
[Chuckle] Did I seriously just put toothpaste on my hairbrush? [Happy] This is getting ridiculous, honestly.
[Shout] Don't talk to me until I figure out what timezone my stomach is in! [Angry]
[Slow] [Disappointed] The worst part is, like, knowing you're gonna crash hard in about three hours but there's nothing you can—yeah.
[Whisper] [Sad] Everyone else is asleep and I'm just here, staring at the wall like some kind of, I dunno, zombie.
[Sarcastic] My body's in New York but apparently my soul is still somewhere over the Pacific. [Tsk] [Sigh]
[Fast] [Happy] Actually, being awake at 4 AM means no traffic, no lines at the store—it's kinda great!
[Groan] Why does water taste weird when you're jet lagged, or is that just—am I imagining things now?
[Angry] I've been home for three days and my sleep schedule is still completely—[Shout] this is insane!
[Slow] You ever feel like your eyeballs are, um, vibrating? [Disappointed] Because that's where I'm at right now.
[Chuckle] [Sarcastic] Yeah, let me just "power through" like everyone keeps suggesting—that's definitely how biology works.
[Sad] I keep forgetting simple words and it's really—what's the word—frustrating, that's it. [Tsk]
[Happy] [Fast] Okay but silver lining: I get to eat dinner twice today and nobody can judge me for it!
SCENARIO: Upset about a missed opportunity, then a better one comes up while talking about it
Wait wait wait—what? You hit—oh my god, are you serious right now? That's like, that's incredible! How do you feel? I mean—wow, I'm actually getting emotional about this [Laugh]
No no, I totally get that. It's gotta be like—I mean, you've been working at this for what, almost a year? That's a huge change, y'know?
Eleven months of just—okay, the dedication though. Like, I watched you meal prep every Sunday, turn down pizza nights, get up at ungodly hours to work out... honestly? You're kinda my hero right now.
Um, excuse me? No—that's literally the hardest part! Showing up every single day when you don't wanna? That's the whole thing! [Sigh] Don't downplay this.
Stop it. The ones from—wait, the dark wash ones you kept in the back of your closet? Those are like, what, fifteen years old?
That's—I'm sorry, loose? They're loose now? Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating. I don't care what you say, we're doing something special.
It's not a fuss, it's—look, you literally just accomplished something most people never do. Like, ninety-whatever percent of diets fail, right? And you just... didn't. [Chuckle]
Oh god, the plateau week. You were so—yeah, you were ready to throw your scale out the window. But you didn't quit, and that's what I'm saying!
I mean, I just—aw, stop. I basically just rambled at you while you nodded politely. But honestly? Watching you push through was kinda inspiring for me too, y'know?
Okay now you're gonna make me cry for real. Come here—actually no, we're getting drinks. Skinny margaritas or whatever you want, but we're toasting to this tonight.
SCENARIO: debating whether to ask for a receipt
[scrutinizing] Oh honey, that one's not going to work. [sharper] The cut-up sides will just emphasize your hips, and [Tsk] we both know you need more coverage there. Maybe try something with a little skirt attached?
[fake sweetness] Of course you can, sweetheart! [patronizing] I'm just trying to help you look your best. [Sigh] When I was your age, I could wear anything, but bodies change differently for everyone, don't they?
[wounded] I'm only thinking of your confidence at the beach! [whimpering] You know how cruel people can be. [more insistent] That black one-piece over there would be so slimming and elegant on you.
[Gasp] Red? [horrified whisper] Darling, bright colors draw attention to problem areas. [pleading voice] At least consider navy or black—they're so much more flattering and sophisticated for fuller figures.
[flustered] That's not what I meant at all! [higher pitch] I just want you to be happy and feel beautiful. [manipulative softness] You used to trust my fashion advice when you were younger, remember?
[defensive shriek] How dare you make me the villain! [trembling] Every mother wants their daughter to be healthy and attractive. [Sniffling] I've only ever wanted the best for you, even if you can't see it.
[coldly] Fine, buy whatever you want. [clipped words] But don't come crying to me when the beach photos surface on Facebook. [bitter tone] Your cousin Sarah just lost twenty pounds—she looks absolutely fantastic now.
[huffing] Impossible approval? [getting louder] I complimented your hair just this morning! [accusatory] You only focus on the negative things I say, never the positive encouragement I try to give you.
[fake hurt] I suppose I'm just a terrible mother then. [dramatic whisper] All those years of caring for you, and this is the thanks I get. [building intensity] Maybe I should just keep my opinions to myself.
[sulking] If that's what you really want. [passive-aggressive sweetness] But when you're wondering why something doesn't look quite right in photos, [trailing off] don't say I didn't try to warn you, darling.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [calmly] According to our system, your account ID 4589-JKL shows the submission deadline was actually March 15th for the 2023 plan year.
[patiently] Let me pull that up for you. [pause] [carefully] Ah, I see the confusion—the extension code you mentioned applies only to dependent care expenses, not medical FSA claims.
[sympathetically] I completely understand this is disappointing. [more gently] Unfortunately, the IRS regulations for plan year 2023, section 125-C, don't allow us to make exceptions after the run-out period ends.
[regretfully] I truly wish I could help with that, but [more firmly] backdating would violate federal compliance rules. [helpfully] However, let me check if any of your receipts qualify for the current 2024 plan year.
[reassuringly] Actually, that January 12th receipt would fall under your 2024 plan! [more optimistically] If you can resubmit it with form FSA-2024-B before June 30th, we can process that $147.23 charge.
[professionally] December 29th would have been part of the 2023 plan year, unfortunately. [explaining patiently] The cutoff is based on service date, not payment date, according to regulation 213-D in your benefits handbook.
[empathetically] I know this feels unfair, and I'm genuinely sorry. [more encouragingly] Would you like me to email you at jchen@techcorp.com a detailed breakdown of what can still be claimed?
[apologetically] I see that error in your file from February, case number SUP-2024-1123. [reassuringly] I've updated your correct address and will personally ensure this email reaches you within the hour.
[positively] Perfect, that January 8th charge definitely qualifies! [helpfully] I'm adding reference number NEW-CLAIM-5643 to track it, and you should receive reimbursement within 7-10 business days.
[confidently] Absolutely, Mr. Chen, those January expenses are secure. [warmly] I've noted everything in ticket FSA-HELP-9987, and [reassuringly] I'll personally monitor your account to ensure smooth processing.
[briskly] Good afternoon, ticket support, how can I help you today? [more quickly] I see you're calling about a transfer issue—let me pull up your account real quick.
[reassuringly] I understand your frustration, let me check that for you. [typing rapidly] Hmm, I'm seeing here that... [confused] wait, did you verify your email through the confirmation link we sent?
[apologetically] Right, I see the issue now—there's a hold on your account. [more quickly] Sometimes this happens when multiple transfer attempts are made within, um, a short timeframe. [professionally] I can override this manually for you.
[efficiently] Okay, I'm releasing the hold now, should just take a moment. [cheerfully] While we wait, can you confirm the recipient's email? [more seriously] Make sure it's spelled exactly right, even one letter off will bounce it back.
[optimistically] Perfect, and... there we go! [triumphantly] The transfer just went through on my end. [quickly] Your friend should receive an email within the next five to ten minutes with her ticket access.
[laughing] Oh no, definitely don't do that—screenshots won't scan at the gate! [more seriously] But you're all set now. [helpfully] Tell your friend to add the ticket to her digital wallet once she gets it.
[quickly] Oh that's just standard language for transferred tickets, nothing to worry about. [reassuringly] Once a ticket's transferred, the new holder can't request refunds directly—[correcting] but the tickets themselves are exactly the same.
[confidently] This time it's different—I pushed it through manually. [enthusiastically] In fact, let me just... [pause] yep, I can see it's already been delivered to her inbox!
[pleased] Excellent, glad we could sort that out for you! [professionally] Is there anything else I can help you with regarding tomorrow's show? [quickly] Parking passes, venue information, anything like that?
[informatively] They stopped requiring those last month actually. [briskly] Just bring your ID and your ticket, that's all you need. [helpfully] Doors open at seven, but I'd suggest arriving by six-thirty if you want decent merch selection.
[Disappointed] Look, I just—I don't have that, um, that maternal instinct everyone talks about, you know? [Sigh] It's not there.
[Happy] Honestly, I love my freedom too much! [Laugh] Like, I can just pack up and go to Thailand tomorrow if I want.
[Fast] People keep saying "you'll change your mind" but I'm thirty-five and still waiting for this magical transformation, so... [Sarcastic] [Tsk]
[Angry] Why does everyone act like I'm—like I'm broken or something just because I don't wanna reproduce? [Groan]
[Slow] The planet's kinda, uh, dying? [Sad] And bringing a kid into this mess feels... I dunno, cruel maybe.
[Whisper] Between you and me, I can barely take care of myself most days. [Chuckle] A tiny human would be a disaster.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just give up my career I worked fifteen years for to, what, watch Bluey all day? [Disappointed]
[Happy] My sister has three kids and honestly—wait, don't tell her this—but it looks absolutely exhausting. [Fast] [Laugh]
[Shout] It's my body! [Angry] I get to decide what happens with it, right?
[Sad] I grew up in a really messed up family and I'm just—I'm terrified I'd repeat those patterns, y'know? [Sigh]
[Slow] Have you seen how much college costs now? [Disappointed] [Groan] It's like a quarter million dollars or something insane.
[Fast] Okay so basically my friend just had a baby and she literally hasn't slept in—what, three months? [Whisper] She looks dead inside.
[Happy] I mean, I've got twelve houseplants and I've killed, um, probably half of them, so... [Chuckle] [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Yeah, 'cause what I really need is someone screaming at 3 AM when I finally got my insomnia under control. [Angry]
[Disappointed] The thing is—actually, you know what? [Slow] I just don't want them, and that should be enough of a reason.
[Sad] My partner and I, we're—we're not even sure we'll make it, honestly. [Sigh] Adding a kid would be... yeah.
[Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too selfish for it, but then I think—wait, isn't that self-aware at least? [Fast]
[Shout] Can we please stop pretending pregnancy is beautiful? [Angry] [Groan] It literally rearranges your organs!
[Happy] I've got, like, seventeen godchildren already, okay? [Laugh] I get to spoil them and send them home—it's perfect!
[Slow] You wanna know the real reason? [Sad] I'm scared I'd love them so much it would break me, and I can't—I just can't risk that.
SCENARIO: Calmly recounting skipping a meeting they thought was recorded, then checking, then finding it wasn't recorded and they missed critical information, spiraling into FOMO professional anxiety
I know, I know—I'm so sorry. I just, I completely froze up when your ex started talking about the breakup and I didn't—I should've jumped in, I know that.
Oh god, was it really three minutes? It felt like—okay no, you're right, it was forever. I kept trying to think of something to say but my brain just [nervous laugh] completely shut down, y'know?
I did! I mean—I do! I always have your back, I swear, but when he started going into all those details I just—I panicked. Like, literally couldn't form words. Which is ironic because usually I can't shut up, right?
Wait wait wait, don't—please don't be like this. I'm trying to—I wanna explain but I know how badly I messed up. Everyone was just staring and I felt like if I said something it might make it worse? But that's—that's not an excuse.
You're right. You're totally right. I should've just, I dunno, spilled my drink or pretended to choke or literally anything other than standing there like an idiot while you were drowning.
I actually—okay this is gonna sound so stupid but I kept thinking about faking a phone call? But then I was like, what if it's too obvious, and then—ugh, I just overthought everything instead of actually helping. [groan] I'm the worst friend ever.
That's somehow worse? Like, honestly, I'd rather be the worst than disappointing. I just—I keep replaying it in my head and thinking of all the things I should've said or done and I can't—I can't stop kicking myself for it.
Oh no. Oh no no no, I didn't—I didn't know you cried. That makes me feel even more terrible, if that's possible. I should've followed you, or—wait, did you want me to follow you?
You're right. You're absolutely right and I—there's no excuse. I failed you when you needed me most and that's just... that's not okay. I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better, I promise. Like, we can practice scenarios or have a code word or something?
Yeah. Yes. Definitely no freezing. And hey, if he ever tries to corner you again, I'll—I'll literally throw myself between you two if I have to. [softer] I really am sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply sorry. You deserved better from me.
I know, I know, okay? My phone died and I—look, I completely spaced it. But it's not like I did it on purpose, I had like a million things going on today.
Don't—don't do that. You're acting like I'm making excuses but I literally had my mom's doctor appointment, then work called me in early, and yeah, I forgot to charge my phone. [Sigh] I'm human, okay?
Wait, what? You didn't—you didn't tell me it was for an interview! You just said you needed a ride downtown, how was I supposed to know it was that important?
Are you seriously—yes! Yes, it would've mattered! I would've like, set three alarms or something. You can't just [frustrated laugh] expect me to read your mind about what's important and what's not.
That's not—okay okay, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you'd actually communicated with me instead of just assuming I'd remember every single thing, maybe—maybe this wouldn't have happened.
I write everything down! I've got like—my whole calendar is full, and sometimes things just... slip through. I'm not perfect, alright? And honestly, you're kinda being unfair here.
Yeah! Yeah, you are! You're sitting here acting like I'm the worst friend in the world when—when have I ever let you down before this? Name one time. [Scoff] But no, one mistake and suddenly I'm unreliable.
I didn't—ugh, I didn't mean to leave you stranded! That's the whole point! My phone was dead, I couldn't even call you when I realized. What was I supposed to do, drive around the entire city looking for you?
Okay fine, fine, you're right. I should've remembered. But I'm not gonna stand here and—and grovel when you won't even acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, shit happens sometimes and it's not about you.
I'll—look, I'll pay you back for the Uber, obviously. But I'm not gonna apologize for being human. And if you wanna stay mad about this forever, then I guess—I dunno what else to tell you.
I—yeah, okay, I did, but Jake specifically asked me not to tell anyone. Like, he made me promise, and I couldn't just—you know I couldn't break that.
That's not—come on, that's not what I meant. You know that's not what I meant. But he was really messed up about it and he needed someone to just... listen without it becoming this whole thing.
No! God, no, that's—[frustrated laugh] you're twisting my words. I'm saying he was in a bad place and he trusted me with something personal. What was I supposed to do, immediately run to you?
Okay okay, but this wasn't my secret to tell! It was Jake's thing, his—his whole situation with his dad, and honestly? I'm kinda frustrated that you can't see why I had to respect that.
That's—ugh, that's so unfair. You're making this about you when it literally had nothing to do with you. I wasn't keeping it from you to hurt you, I was keeping it because someone asked me to. There's a difference.
Yes! Obviously there is! Look look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but you're acting like I—like I chose him over you or something, which is not what happened. [Sigh] At all.
I didn't lie! I just... didn't tell you one thing. One thing out of, what, hundreds? Thousands? And now you're gonna throw away our entire friendship because I kept one promise to someone else?
Yeah, and it sucked! It really really sucked, okay? But I was stuck between—between two people I care about, and I made a call. Maybe it was wrong, I dunno, but I'm not gonna apologize for trying to be a good friend to someone who needed it.
I—that's... [scoff] I am constantly a good friend to you. Constantly. And the one time, the one time I have to put someone else's trust first, you're ready to just... what, end this?
Well that's—that's great. Really great. Y'know, I thought you'd at least try to understand, but apparently keeping one promise makes me the worst friend ever. Fine. Whatever.
Okay, I know it didn't go how we—how I thought it would, but you gotta believe me, I really thought you two would hit it off. Like, on paper, you're perfect for each other.
Don't—don't do that. You know what I mean. You both love hiking, you're both into those weird documentaries, you literally have the same sense of humor. I wasn't just throwing you at some random person.
I didn't—[groan] I didn't know they were still hung up on them, okay? Last time we talked, they said they were totally over it. Like, completely done. How was I supposed to know they were lying?
That's not—come on, that's not fair. I've known them for like three years. They seemed ready, they told me they wanted to meet someone new. I mean, they literally asked if I knew anyone.
No! God, no, that's not what—you're twisting this. I genuinely, honestly thought you'd be good together. [frustrated laugh] I'm sorry it sucked, I am, but I wasn't trying to use you as some kind of test dummy.
Okay okay, I get that you're pissed, but you're acting like I deliberately sabotaged you or something. I was trying to help. Maybe I should've—I dunno, vetted them better or whatever, but my intentions were good.
And that sucks! It does, I'm not saying it doesn't. But like—ugh, you know what? You could've left. You could've texted me for an out, you could've just walked away, but you didn't.
For my—[scoff] okay, so now I'm responsible for you being too nice to leave a bad date? That's on me too? Come on.
Because I thought—I still think they're a good person, they're just... obviously not ready. And yeah, I missed that, fine fine, I screwed up there. But I wasn't being malicious about it.
That's—wow. Okay. If that's how you wanna be about it. I try to do something nice, it goes badly, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever. Real proportionate response there.
Wait wait wait—you matched? Like, THE match? Oh my god, did you—did you get your results already?
HOPKINS? Are you—[Gasp] that's your number one! That's literally your dream program! Oh my god, I'm gonna cry, I'm actually gonna cry right now.
Processing? Babe, you just got into like, the best neuro program in the country! This is—this is everything you've been working for since, what, sophomore year?
Twelve? You've wanted this since you were twelve? That's—okay that's making me even more emotional. Did you tell your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it.
No no no, it's real, it's definitely real! You—I mean, you logged in yourself, right? You saw it with your own eyes?
[Laugh] Of course you do. That's so—that's so you. But like, honestly? After everything you've done—all those insane hours, the research, that brutal attending who made you cry that one time—you earned this.
Okay, um, excuse me? You literally just survived med school while publishing two papers and somehow still remembered my birthday every year. You're gonna—you're gonna crush this.
Yeah, it's... it's far. [Sigh] But like, we'll visit! And honestly? Baltimore's kinda cool now, apparently. My cousin lives there and she's always posting these cute coffee shops and stuff.
Are you kidding? Obviously I'm visiting! I'm already planning like—okay wait, when do you start? July? I'm literally gonna help you move and everything.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry again. But seriously though—Dr. Future Neurologist at Johns Hopkins? That's... that's who you are now. How completely insane is that?
SCENARIO: trying to remember the word that's on the tip of their tongue
[breathlessly] Don't say that! [higher pitched] We studied together every single day, remember? [Nervous laugh] Okay, okay, let's count to three and open them at the exact same time. My heart is beating so fast I might actually pass out.
[frantically] Are you insane? [slower, trembling] If I passed and you didn't, I'd feel horrible. [Gasp] Let's just rip off the band-aid together. Put your finger on your screen. Ready? Here we go—clicking now!
[stunned whisper] Mine says... [explosive joy] PASS! WE'RE LAWYERS! [Shrieking laugh] We actually did it! Remember when we thought we'd never understand constitutional law? And now look at us—actual attorneys! This is insane!
[giddy] Let them wait! [more seriously] This moment is ours first. [Whooping] We survived the worst exam known to mankind! Remember day two when we both cried in the parking lot? Worth every tear now!
[emotionally] Six years of friendship, three years of study groups. [choking up] We dreamed about this day so many times. [Soft laugh] Now we need to plan the biggest celebration party in history. Champagne is definitely not enough!
[in disbelief] I keep refreshing to make sure it's real. [more confidently] It still says pass! [Cackling] Remember Professor Williams who said we asked too many questions? Bet those questions helped us pass this beast!
[philosophically] You know what's crazy? [building excitement] Yesterday we were just law graduates, today we're actual lawyers! [Breathless laugh] The imposter syndrome is hitting hard, but who cares—we earned this title fair and square!
[solemnly] I promise. [brightening up] We should take a screenshot of these results immediately! [Giggling] Future us will need proof that this happiness existed. Also, should we update LinkedIn now or wait until tomorrow?
[mockingly formal] "I am humbled to share..." [breaking character, laughing] Who are we kidding? [Enthusiastically] I'm posting "I'M A LAWYER" in all caps with fifty exclamation points! Humble can wait until tomorrow!
[warmly] Thank you for going through this with me. [getting emotional] Having a study partner who became family made everything bearable. [Happy sigh] Now let's go get those drinks we've been promising ourselves since day one of bar prep!
[professionally] I do apologize for the inconvenience, sir. [calmly] Let me pull up your reservation—could you please verify the email address on file? [reassuring] We'll definitely get this sorted out for you today.
[sympathetic] I can see those previous interactions here, Mr. Morrison. [concerned] Your flight from JFK to LAX on March 15th was indeed cancelled. [apologetically] Um, it appears there was a processing error with code E-447 on your account.
[patiently] The E-447 indicates a payment verification issue, sir. [helpful tone] I'll need to transfer you to our billing department at extension 8823. [more confidently] They can override this and process your refund immediately, within 24 hours actually.
[understanding] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Morrison. [determined] Let me try something different—I'm escalating this to supervisor code S-99A right now. [reassuring] My badge number is 6674, and I'm personally flagging this for priority processing.
[confidently] Absolutely, your new reference number is RF-20240315-AAB9. [clearly] I'm sending a text confirmation now to 555-0147, and [helpfully] you'll receive an email within 4 hours showing the refund pending to your card ending in... let me confirm, 7782?
[quickly] Let me update that immediately—7728, correct. [relieved] Actually, this might be why the previous attempts failed. [optimistic tone] The system shows your refund can now process to the correct card within 2-3 business days maximum.
[professionally] Our escalation line is 1-800-555-9900, ask for Team Lead Jennifer Martinez. [reassuring] But Mr. Morrison, I've added priority flag P-1 to your case. [confidently] You should see the full $847.50 by Friday at the latest.
[assuringly] The text is being sent as we speak, sir. [helpful] It'll include your reference number, my badge ID, and the expected refund date. [sincerely] I truly apologize for all the trouble you've experienced with this.
[explaining] Pending approval is just our standard verification process, takes about 2 hours. [reassuring tone] Since it's marked P-1 priority, it bypasses the regular queue. [confidently] By 5:30 PM today, you'll get another text saying "approved for processing."
[understanding] I've documented everything in your file, Mr. Morrison, including today's corrections. [professionally] My shift ends at 6 PM, but I'm personally monitoring your case. [warmly] Thank you for your patience, and again, reference RF-20240315-AAB9 for any follow-up.
[briskly] Good afternoon, Appliance World, this is Sarah speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today—do you have an order number I can look up for you?
[apologetically] Let me just... pull that up for you right away. [pause] Oh, I see here it's showing as backordered. [more quietly] Unfortunately the manufacturer has delayed shipment.
[quickly] I understand your frustration, absolutely, and you're right—someone should have contacted you. [more firmly] Let me check our inventory system to see if we have any alternatives in stock.
[hesitantly] The system shows... well, it's indicating another two to three weeks. [hurriedly] But wait, I can escalate this to our priority fulfillment team, they sometimes have access to different stock.
[reassuringly] Of course, let me get my supervisor right away. [more quickly] Before I do though, I can offer you fifteen percent off for the inconvenience, plus free installation when it arrives.
[professionally] Absolutely, I'll email you the confirmation right now while you hold. [briskly] My manager Jennifer will be with you in just a moment—she has more authority to expedite orders.
[apologetically] You're absolutely right, that's our policy. [quickly] I'm seeing a note here that... hmm, the automated system flagged an incorrect phone number. [defensively] Though we should have emailed regardless.
[calmly] She can go up to twenty-five percent, sometimes thirty for situations like this. [reassuringly] Plus she has direct contacts at the warehouse who might locate your specific model faster.
[sympathetically] I completely understand, these timeline disruptions cascade into everything else. [more quickly] Jennifer's just finishing another call—she'll be about thirty more seconds, and I promise she'll make this right.
[urgently] Please don't cancel just yet—Jennifer can actually match competitor timelines in many cases. [quickly] She has override codes for express shipping that I don't have access to. [hopefully] Just give her two minutes?
[Disappointed] Look, I wanted to go, I really did, but when Dad got sick, someone had to—someone had to take over the shop. [Sigh]
[Fast] [Happy] Honestly, best decision I ever made because I started my business at eighteen and now I'm doing better than, like, all my friends with degrees!
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just pull forty thousand dollars out of thin air for tuition. [Tsk] That would've been nice.
[Slow] I guess I just... I dunno, I never really saw myself as the academic type, you know? [Shrug]
[Angry] [Shout] Why does everyone assume you're a failure if you don't have a degree? I'm doing FINE!
[Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified of leaving home—like, absolutely terrified. [Sad]
[Chuckle] My guidance counselor literally told me I wasn't "college material," so, uh, yeah, that kinda killed my confidence right there.
[Fast] [Disappointed] I had a full scholarship lined up but then Mom—she needed help with the twins and I couldn't just leave her.
[Happy] [Laugh] Dude, I went straight into coding bootcamp for three months and got hired immediately—why would I waste four years?
[Slow] [Sad] The acceptance letter came the same week as the diagnosis, and suddenly college just... it didn't matter anymore.
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, because sitting in a classroom learning theory while my friends were out there actually doing stuff seemed super appealing.
Trade school made way more sense—I mean, plumbers make bank and nobody talks about that, right? [Chuckle]
[Angry] I'm so tired of explaining this to people like it's some kind of—like I failed at life or something. [Groan]
[Whisper] [Disappointed] I actually got into my dream school but, um, the financial aid fell through last minute.
[Happy] Military gave me everything college would've, plus they paid ME to learn, so honestly, no regrets there! [Laugh]
[Slow] You wanna know the truth? [Sad] [Sigh] I just wasn't ready—mentally, emotionally, none of it.
[Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm sorry, should I have gone into massive debt to get a degree in something I'd probably hate anyway?
[Disappointed] [Slow] My anxiety was so bad senior year that I couldn't even—I couldn't imagine leaving town, let alone going to college.
[Shout] [Happy] I got discovered at seventeen and went straight to touring—college can wait, but that opportunity couldn't!
[Groan] [Angry] Every family dinner it's the same question, and I'm just—I'm done justifying my life choices to everyone, okay?
SCENARIO: Complaining about a bad restaurant review they left, then realizes while talking that they went to the wrong location
Oh god, okay—I can explain! It wasn't—I mean, they were asking about you and I thought maybe you'd be interested? Like, they seemed really nice and I just—I dunno, I thought I was helping.
No no no, you're right, that sounds—that sounds terrible when you say it like that. I wasn't thinking about it as personal information, y'know? Just your number. But that's—[groan] that's literally what personal information is. I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry. I really—I should've asked you first. Obviously. Like that's just basic respect and I completely ignored it because I got excited about playing matchmaker or whatever. Which is so stupid.
Oh no. Oh no no no, they called you already? I told them—wait, actually I didn't tell them anything about when to call. [nervous laugh] God, I really didn't think this through at all, did I? I'm so sorry.
Shit. I mean—shit. That's... yeah. I can um, I can talk to them? Tell them to back off? I know that doesn't fix what I did but maybe it'll help? I dunno, I'm just—I'm trying to think of something here.
Right. Right, of course. I won't—I won't do anything else without asking you. Promise. I just... I feel terrible about this, honestly. Like you trusted me with your number and I just handed it out like it was nothing.
I know. I mean—I know that now. I should've known it before. You're really private about stuff and I just completely steamrolled over that because I thought—doesn't matter what I thought. [sigh] I messed up bad.
Because I'm—okay this is gonna sound dumb but I was worried you'd say no? And I thought Alex was perfect for you and I wanted to surprise you with this great thing but instead I just... violated your trust. Basically.
Yeah. Yeah, when you—when you put it like that it sounds really, really bad. Because it is. It is bad. I basically decided I knew better than you about your own life which is so messed up. I'm really, truly sorry. I don't—I don't know how to make you believe me but I am.
Yes. Absolutely. I will, I promise. And there's gonna—I mean, I'm gonna work really hard to make sure there is a next time? That you'll still wanna be friends with me after this. Because I know I screwed up but you're—you're really important to me and I promise I'll do better.
Wait wait wait—the Whitmore? As in like, the one where they literally have security checking net worth at the door? That's—oh my god, that's huge!
Okay so you're gonna need—I mean, we're gonna need to get you something absolutely stunning. Like, this is not a rent-the-runway situation, y'know? This is like... this is the real deal. [Gasp] Do you have a plus one?
Um, hello? Are you—are you actually sitting there pretending like I'm not literally right here begging with my eyes? Because I will, I will absolutely beg out loud if that's what you need.
Okay okay, yes, but like—that was before I knew we could go judge everyone together! Plus honestly? The champagne is probably worth more than my car payment, so... [Laugh] priorities, right?
Oh no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You know exactly why. That project you did? The one that basically saved their entire—what was it, their sustainability initiative? They'd be idiots not to invite you.
Just data—babe, you literally restructured their entire carbon offset program! In like, what, three weeks? That's not "just" anything, that's... that's genius-level stuff.
Okay first of all, nobody actually knows which fork is which—they're all just pretending, trust me. And second, you're like... you're the most naturally sophisticated person I know. You just don't realize it because you're not, y'know, trying to be. [Sigh]
Honestly? Good. These people need someone who's gonna—who's actually real, y'know? Someone who isn't just another MBA robot making small talk about portfolios or whatever they discuss at these things.
Um, absolutely not—no way. You're going. Because like, imposter syndrome is such a—it's such a liar, okay? And also because if you don't go, I will literally never forgive you for depriving me of living vicariously through your fancy evening.
I—okay that was one time! One time at your cousin's wedding and suddenly I'm branded for life as the centerpiece thief? [Laugh] But yes yes yes, thank you, I promise I'll behave. Mostly. Probably. We'll see.
SCENARIO: waiting for the waiter to notice them
[trembling] Oh my god, look at how he's shaking. [voice breaking] He's pulling out the ring and I can't—this is exactly how Jake proposed to me. [Soft sob] The sunset behind them is perfect, just like ours was.
[Gasping breath] He's getting on one knee! [high pitched] This part always destroys me completely. [quieter] My chest feels so tight watching this—it's beautiful but it hurts, you know? Why does happy stuff make us cry harder than sad stuff?
[laughing through tears] You're right, you're absolutely right about that. [louder] Oh shit, she said yes! [Squealing] Look at them spinning around like that! My mascara is completely gone now, I must look like a raccoon who got caught in rain.
[hoarse whisper] The way she covers her mouth when she realizes. [nostalgic tone] That's such a universal reaction to shock and joy, isn't it? [Shaky exhale] I did the same thing when Jake asked, before I could even say yes properly.
[determined] We definitely will, don't even doubt it. [Sniffle] Should we watch another one or have we tortured ourselves enough? [lighter tone] My heart can't take much more but I'm also addicted to this beautiful pain somehow.
[mock serious] Deal, but I'm choosing the next one. [getting faster] Oh wait, here comes another proposal at Disneyland! [Groaning] Why do I do this to myself? It's like emotional masochism but I literally cannot look away.
[through laughter] The fireworks are perfectly timed with my sob schedule. [breathless] How do they even plan these things so well? [quieter] Meanwhile I can't even plan what I'm having for dinner tonight without having an existential crisis.
[strained voice] The ring is gorgeous, look at that rock! [joking] If someone proposed to me with that, I'd say yes before they finished talking. [more serious] Actually, who am I kidding? I'd take a ring pop at this point.
[exhausted tone] Okay, I'm officially emotionally drained now. [perking up] But look how her dad is crying too! [Soft sob] That's it, that's what broke me completely. Dads crying at proposals should be illegal, it's too much.
[gentle] Come here, let's hug it out properly. [firmly] Your dad would be so proud of you regardless. [whispered] We're going to find love that makes everyone cry happy tears, I promise you that. Even if we're ninety when it happens.
[frustrated] Your Honor, on March 15th at 2:47 PM, Mr. Davidson here changed the locks on my apartment at 4821 Oak Street—while I was at work! [voice breaking] I came home to find all my belongings, my grandmother's china, just... [sighs heavily] dumped on the sidewalk.
[outraged] Three months? I paid $1,850 on January 5th, check number 3021! [louder] February's payment was rejected because—because you claimed insufficient funds, but my bank statement shows [voice shaking] the money was there!
[incredulous] You never told me about any penalty fee! [getting louder] And even if—even if there was one, that doesn't give you the right to throw my disabled mother's medical equipment, her oxygen tank serial number OX-78234, onto the street! [voice cracking]
[desperately] Your Honor, those aren't even my phone numbers anymore—I updated my contact to 555-0122 in December! [pleading] He's been harassing me since I complained about the broken heater in unit 3B that he refused to fix for six weeks.
[sarcastically] Oh yes, "maintenance visits" where you'd bang on my door at midnight! [voice rising] My security camera footage from February 28th, timestamp 23:47:33, shows you trying to enter with [gasps] what looks like a crowbar!
[exasperated] False complaints? The mold in my bathroom tested positive for Stachybotrys, report number ENV-5543-X! [more emotionally] My four-year-old daughter has been sick since November, and you—you said it was just [mockingly] "a little moisture."
[desperately] Your Honor, I have receipts—$342.50 for the hotel on March 15th, $1,200 for emergency storage unit A-44 at SecureStore, and [voice breaking] $500 to replace my daughter's medications that were destroyed in the rain!
[incredulous] Payment plan? You mean that paper you shoved under my door at 11 PM with no signature line? [more firmly] The one that demanded I pay late fees from 2019 for apartment 2C—which I never even lived in?
[emotionally] Administrative confusion that left me and my daughter homeless for five nights! [voice cracking] The shelter at 892 Mission Boulevard was full, so we—we slept in my car, license plate 7G9-X24, [whispers] in twenty-degree weather.
[angrily] What water damage? The only leak was from YOUR faulty pipes that burst on February 14th! [louder] The plumber's invoice PL-20240214-66 specifically states "landlord negligence" and—and "deferred maintenance since 2021"! [sighs heavily]
[cheerfully] Hello, welcome to ShopEasy support! [quickly] I see you're reaching out about a login issue today. [reassuring] Don't worry, we'll get this sorted right away—could you describe what's happening when you try to sign in?
[calmly] I completely understand your frustration. [briskly] Let me pull up your account—what's the email address you're using? [more softly] And just to confirm, you're not seeing any other error messages, right, just the invalid credentials one?
[thoughtfully] Hmm, that refreshing issue is... unusual. [more quickly] Have you tried clearing your browser cache or maybe—actually, wait—are you using any password managers or browser extensions that might be interfering?
[briskly] Let's try disabling both temporarily, just to rule them out. [reassuring] Sometimes these extensions can conflict with our security features—it's more common than you'd think. [quickly] Can you try that now while I'm here?
[satisfied] Ah, there we go! [more quickly] Your ad blocker was hiding our captcha verification—that's why it kept failing. [chuckles softly] The system thought you were a bot since it couldn't verify the captcha that you couldn't even see.
[Disappointed] I mean, it's kinda flattering, I guess, but like—when you showed up in the exact same jacket? [Sigh] That was a bit much.
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, you just happened to dye your hair the same shade of purple? [Tsk] What a crazy coincidence, right?
[Fast] Okay so basically everyone's been asking me if we coordinated and I'm like no, no we didn't, she just—[Groan] whatever.
[Happy] You know what? I'm actually gonna take this as a compliment because clearly I have amazing taste! [Laugh]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I think she's been, um, screenshot-ing all my outfits from Instagram. [Slow] It's getting really weird.
[Angry] This is my thing—I worked really hard to develop my own style and now you're just, what, stealing it? [Shout] Find your own identity!
[Sad] I used to feel special, y'know? Like I had something unique about me, but now I just—[Sigh] I dunno anymore.
[Chuckle] Remember when you said my style was "too out there"? [Sarcastic] Funny how things change, huh?
[Fast] She literally bought the same sneakers, the same bag, even started using my catchphrases—it's like, get your own personality! [Angry] [Tsk]
[Slow] I wanna say something to her but, uh, how do you even bring that up without sounding totally paranoid? [Disappointed]
[Happy] Wait, are you seriously asking where I got my vintage band tees? [Laugh] [Fast] Girl, you gotta do your own thrift store hunting!
[Whisper] I actually started buying stuff I don't even like just to see if she'd copy those too. [Chuckle] She did.
[Sad] [Slow] The worst part is we used to have our own distinct vibes, and now people think we're like, trying to be twins or something.
[Shout] Stop tagging me in those "who wore it better" posts! [Angry] It's not funny anymore!
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh let me guess, you suddenly discovered your love for obscure Japanese streetwear brands all by yourself?
[Disappointed] I'm honestly thinking about just—I dunno, completely changing everything about how I dress. [Sigh] Maybe that'll fix this.
[Happy] You know what's kinda hilarious? She copies everything except the thrift store stuff—[Laugh] [Fast] guess she's too good for secondhand!
[Slow] It's not even about the clothes anymore, it's more like, er, the principle of it? [Sad] [Tsk] I thought we were closer than this.
[Angry] [Fast] I spent years—YEARS—figuring out what works for me and you just waltz in and carbon copy everything in two months?
[Whisper] Honestly? I'm gonna start telling people she inspired MY style. [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] See how she likes that little plot twist.
SCENARIO: Annoyed about a wrong food delivery, then the app refunds and lets them keep it
Wait wait wait—you WHAT? You bought a—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like an actual house? With walls and a roof and everything?
I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is so so huge. How are you feeling? Are you totally freaking out or—actually, you seem pretty calm about it.
No no no, that's totally normal though. Like when I got my car I didn't believe it was mine for like... weeks? [Laugh] But a house is way bigger than that, obviously.
Oh god, the paperwork—yeah, my cousin just went through that and she said her hand was literally cramping by the end. But hey, you did it! You're like, officially an adult now or whatever.
Okay okay, but you know what I mean. This is different. This is like—you own property now. That's kinda wild to think about, right? Like you have a deed and everything?
[Groan] Ugh, don't—don't even mention the M word. But honestly? Still worth it. No more landlords, no more rent increases, no more asking permission to hang a picture. That's gotta feel good.
Yes! See, that's—that's what I'm talking about! What color are you thinking? Please don't say beige. Everyone always picks beige and it's so... boring.
Ooh, moody—I love it. Very like, sophisticated and grown-up. When do you actually move in? Do you need help? Because I'm totally available to carry boxes or whatever you need.
Um, obviously I'll be there. With coffee and donuts because that's what you do for moves, right? [Sigh] God, I can't believe you bought a house. Remember when we couldn't even afford decent ramen?
Okay but—shut up, you know what I mean! This is just... I'm really really proud of you. Like genuinely. You worked so hard for this.
I didn't—okay, I mentioned it, but only because it was literally relevant to what we were talking about. Like, everyone was sharing stories about—y'know what, never mind, you're already pissed.
Yeah, and? That doesn't mean it just disappears. You never actually apologized for that whole mess, you just—[sigh] we just stopped talking about it and pretended everything was fine.
No! God, that's not—I'm not punishing anyone. But sometimes stuff comes up naturally in conversation and I can't just, like, edit my entire history because you wanna pretend it didn't happen.
You moved past it. You decided we were done talking about it and that was that. I never got to actually—look, I tried to bring it up a few times and you always shut me down, so...
That's—okay okay, that's not fair. I didn't plan this. It just came out because, honestly? [frustrated laugh] Maybe I'm still kinda messed up about it. Maybe I needed to actually deal with it instead of just burying it.
I know how long it's been! But time doesn't just magically fix things that never got resolved. You hurt me—like, really hurt me—and we never actually talked about it. We just... moved on.
I dunno, maybe just acknowledge that it happened? That it mattered? Instead of acting like I'm—like I'm crazy for still having feelings about it. You can't just decide when someone else should be over something.
Oh, come on, don't—don't do that. Don't make it sound like some chore you're gonna check off your list. [scoff] This is exactly what you did last time.
Are you though? Because it feels like you're just—you're mad that I embarrassed you, not that there's actually something unfinished between us. Like, you still don't think you did anything wrong, do you?
It didn't—I know it didn't help, okay? I'm not saying it was the right time or place, but sometimes stuff just... bubbles up. And maybe if we'd actually dealt with it properly, it wouldn't keep happening. I'm sorry it came out like that, but I'm not sorry for still feeling some type of way about it.
I know, I know, okay? I just—there was so much going on with planning this thing and I literally had like twenty people to coordinate and somehow it just... slipped my mind. [frustrated laugh] Which I realize sounds terrible.
That's not—come on, that's not true. Remember your birthday? I made that whole separate dish just for you. And—and the barbecue last month? I literally bought those expensive vegan burgers.
Okay, fine, maybe I'm not perfect about it, but you're acting like I do this intentionally. I don't—I genuinely forgot this time. There's a difference between forgetting and not caring.
That's... [scoff] wow. That's really what you think of me? After everything? I mean, I'm sorry I'm not keeping a spreadsheet of everyone's dietary stuff, but I'm trying here.
I—okay, you know what? Maybe I'm not trying hard enough for your standards, but I'm also planning these entire get-togethers while everyone else just shows up. Including you. So maybe—maybe cut me some slack?
Because you offering to help doesn't—it doesn't fix the fact that I should remember, I get that. But honestly? Sometimes it feels like you're just... waiting for me to mess up so you can be disappointed.
And that sucks, it really does, and I'm—look, I am sorry about that part. [sigh] But you could've reminded me when I sent the group chat about food. Like, one text. That's all.
No, you shouldn't. You're right. But we're—we're supposed to be friends, right? And sometimes friends mess up. I dunno, I just thought you'd be more... understanding, I guess.
Don't do that—don't make it sound like—ugh. Look look, I screwed up, okay? I admit it. But you're acting like this is some massive betrayal when it's literally just... my brain being garbage at remembering details.
That's—okay, that's fair. That's actually... yeah. [quieter] I didn't think about it like that. I just—I saw it as a food thing, not a... you thing. Which I guess is the problem, huh.
I know, I know, I'm so sorry—there was this whole thing with the subway and then I—wait, actually no, let me start over. I should've texted you. I totally should've texted.
Okay, yeah, that's—that's fair. Um, honestly? I lost track of time at first, which I know sounds terrible but then the train just stopped for like twenty minutes and I couldn't get signal underground [nervous laugh] and I kept thinking "they're gonna kill me, they're literally gonna kill me."
Oh god, you—you waited outside? I thought you'd just grab a table and—no, that's even worse, isn't it? You were just standing there waiting for me like an idiot because I'm an idiot.
I'm really, really sorry. Like, genuinely. This isn't—I don't mean to be that friend, y'know? The one who's always late and everyone just expects it. That's not who I wanna be.
I—yeah. Yeah, you're right. [Sigh] I guess I am. It's not on purpose though, I swear, it's just like my brain doesn't process time right or something? That sounds like an excuse—it is an excuse. Sorry.
But you didn't? You—you stayed and waited for me even though I'm literally the worst friend ever and I don't deserve—sorry, I'm not trying to make this about me. I just... thank you for not leaving.
No no no, totally get that. You should be mad. I would be—actually, I'd probably have left after like fifteen minutes, so the fact that you stayed means you're basically a saint and I'm just this disaster person who can't even—[groan] I'm doing it again, aren't I? The rambling thing.
Right. Okay. Shutting up now. Except—wait, can I just say one more thing? I'm gonna set like five alarms next time. Actually, you know what? You can just tell me to show up an hour before you actually wanna meet.
Really? You're not—I mean, you're still mad, I can tell, but like... we're okay? Or we're gonna be okay? Eventually?
Yes! Absolutely, whatever you want—I'm buying everything. The most expensive thing on the menu, I don't even care. And next time I'm gonna be early, I swear, like awkwardly early where I'm just sitting there for twenty minutes checking my phone.
Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's incredible! I mean, finally, right? They've been making you wait forever for this.
Senior director! That's—okay, that's huge. Like, actually huge. How are you even being so calm about this? I'd be literally bouncing off the walls [Laugh] or something.
No no, I get it, I totally get it. It's like—you work so hard for something and then when it actually happens you're just... numb? Kinda? But seriously, you've earned this.
God, three years—that's actually criminal how long they made you wait. But you never gave up, y'know? Even when they kept moving the goalposts and being all—ugh, corporate nonsense.
I remember! That one time you were literally—you had the resignation letter drafted and everything. [Sigh] Thank god you didn't though, right? I mean, look at you now.
They—wait, they actually apologized? Like, management admitted they were wrong? That's... honestly that's kinda unheard of. What did they even say?
Budget issues, sure sure—I mean, it's always budget issues, isn't it? But at least they're like, acknowledging it now. Are you gonna celebrate or—actually, we should definitely celebrate.
Okay okay, but this is different! This is like—you've been grinding for this forever, and I've watched you just... pour everything into that place. Even just dinner? Something small?
Yes! Perfect, totally—we can go to that place you like with the, um, the really good pasta? [Chuckle] The one where they don't play music too loud?
Oh stop—no no, don't even. I'm just, I'm really proud of you, okay? Like genuinely. You deserve every bit of this, even if you're gonna be all modest about it.
SCENARIO: discovering their pen ran out mid-signature
[exhausted but elated] My sword arm burns like fire, but by God, it was worth every swing. [deep satisfied sigh] Their so-called impenetrable walls crumbled like bread. [building excitement] We actually did it, brother!
[gravely] The cost was steep though. [slower pace] Young Marcus, brave Thomas, that fool Geoffrey with his jokes... [bitter laugh] They should be here planting this flag with us, not lying cold in the mud below.
[weary tone] What now, though? [contemplative] We've toppled kings, conquered the unconquerable. [nervous laugh] Do we become lords ourselves, or does the road call us to more battles, more blood, more glory somewhere else?
[relieved laughter] Thank God you said it first! [warmly] I was terrified you'd want to settle down, grow fat on wine. [loud declaration] Our work isn't finished until every corrupt castle bears a righteous flag!
[joyful bellow] Then let them hear us from the valleys to the mountains! [commanding tone] Victory is ours! [Thunderous roar] The age of tyranny ends today, and the age of justice begins NOW!
[confused] Wait, wait, wait. [slower] The blue and green peacock scarf? [voice rising] From Margot's Boutique on Fifth Street? Because I literally have that exact same scarf [Nervous laugh] sitting in my car right now.
[hysterically] I'm dying, I'm actually dying right now! [Gasping breath] Remember when we were kids and showed up in matching outfits? [quieter] She's never letting us live this down. [Cackling] Never ever ever.
[mockingly] Oh brilliant, yes, because every woman dreams of duplicate scarves! [Hissing laugh] Or wait— [excited whisper] what if I return mine super quick and grab those earrings instead? [hopefully] The mall's still open for another hour.
[in disbelief] Three hundred dollar scarves. [voice dropping] Three HUNDRED dollars each and we picked the same one. [Explosive laugh] At least it proves we both have expensive taste? [weakly] That's genetic, right? Good genes?
[panicking] Oh God, Aunt Linda's going to post about this on Facebook! [in dread] "My nieces bought their mother matching scarves, so precious!" [Choking laugh] With like fifty emoji hearts. [resigned] Our reputation as adults is officially over.
[sarcastically bright] Oh sure, we're very observant! [deadpan] So observant we observed the exact same thing. [Wheezing laugh] Next year we're making a shared spreadsheet. [firmly] With color coding and everything, I'm not kidding anymore.
[exhausted] I can't breathe, seriously stop! [Gasping] My stomach hurts from laughing. [in a whisper] But imagine Mom's face when she opens the second one. [building up] "Oh wow, another peacock scarf, how... thoughtful?"
[resigned laugh] You're insane but I love it. [thoughtfully] Although knowing Mom, she'll probably keep both and wear them [sing-song voice] at the same time somehow. [Snort] Remember her layering phase? This is perfect actually.
[playing along] Absolutely! [in fake commercial voice] "The Peacock Scarf Collection, by daughters who definitely planned this!" [normally] We should walk in together holding them up like [Giggling] synchronized swimmers. [determined] Own it completely, no shame.
[tenderly] You're right, she really will. [Soft laugh] Two disasters of daughters who love her enough to buy the same overpriced scarf. [warmly building] Come on, let's go face this together. [cheerfully] Matching gift bags and everything!
[professionally] Good morning, I can definitely help you with that portal access issue. [reassuring tone] Let me pull up your account using that MRN number—45782, correct? [more carefully] While I'm looking, have you tried the "forgot password" link on the login page at www.healthportal.medcenter.org/reset?
[sympathetically] I completely understand your urgency, especially with tomorrow's appointment approaching. [in a helpful tone] I see here your email on file is actually patricia.k.wilson@yahoo.com, not Gmail—could that be why? [pause] Let me update it right now to your current Gmail address, if you can verify it for me?
[understanding] No worries at all, these portals can definitely be confusing sometimes. [more focused] I'm seeing that particular reset link expired after 24 hours, which would be, um, 9:47 AM today. [cheerfully] Let me generate a fresh one for you right now—it'll be valid for the next 48 hours this time.
[clarifying tone] Your username should actually be your full email address, not that PW number—that's just your temporary access code from initial registration. [more patiently] Sometimes the system gets confused if you're using autofill on your browser. [helpfully] Try clearing your cache or, even better, using an incognito window when you attempt to log in.
[warmly] Of course, I can walk you through it step by step, no worries! [encouraging] For now, I've sent that new reset link to your Yahoo email—should arrive within 2-3 minutes. [more specifically] When you get it, click the blue button that says "Reset Now," enter the temporary password XK9-TMP-2024, then create your own new password with at least 8 characters.
[firmly] Sir, I understand you're upset about the temperature of your food. [sighs] Let me—let me pull up your order details here. [more calmly] When exactly did you pick it up?
[apologetically] That's absolutely not acceptable, and I'm truly sorry. [quickly] We pride ourselves on hot, fresh food—this shouldn't happen. [more firmly] Can you bring the order back so we can remake it immediately?
[understanding] Of course, of course, I completely understand your frustration. [briskly] Here's what I can do—we'll prepare a fresh order right away. [reassuringly] And naturally, there'll be no charge for either meal.
[confidently] I'll personally supervise the kitchen myself this time. [quickly] In fact—wait, let me check—yes, I can have our driver deliver it. [earnestly] Should be there in, oh, twenty-five minutes maximum.
[sympathetically] No, no, you're not being difficult at all—cold food ruins everything. [briskly] I'm adding a complimentary dessert for your trouble. [warmly] What's the special occasion, if you don't mind me asking?
[touched] Oh, that's wonderful—congratulations to her! [enthusiastically] You know what? Let me throw in our chocolate lava cake too. [quickly] Kids love that one, trust me.
[chuckling] Yes, fifteen years now, believe it or not. [briskly] Listen, I'm writing a note for your file—next visit, appetizers are on us. [sincerely] We want to make this right.
[laughing] I've dealt with my share of those calls! [quickly] Your driver's name is Marcus, he'll text when he's close. [reassuringly] Everything will be piping hot, I promise.
[understanding] Please, don't apologize—you had every right to be upset. [briskly] Cold food after paying good money? [emphatically] I'd be calling too, probably less politely.
[proudly] That's what we're here for—real solutions, not just damage control. [quickly] Oh, Marcus just left—twenty minutes, tops. [warmly] Tell your daughter congratulations from all of us.
[Happy] So, um, you actually like horror movies too? [Laugh] I thought I was gonna have to pretend to enjoy rom-coms for the next few hours!
[Whisper] Okay, don't look now, but I think that couple behind us is having, like, the world's most intense breakup. [Fast] Should we move tables or just embrace the drama?
[Sad] I'm gonna be honest, I almost canceled tonight because I was so nervous—I mean, dating apps are weird, right? [Sigh]
[Slow] This place has, um, really changed since I was here last. [Disappointed] It used to be way more—I dunno, cozy?
[Sarcastic] Oh great, my ex just walked in. [Tsk] This is exactly what I needed to make tonight less awkward.
[Fast] Wait, you're telling me you've never tried sushi? [Happy] Oh my god, we gotta fix that—I know this amazing place that does, like, beginner-friendly rolls!
[Angry] Sorry, I just—I literally got stood up last week, so I'm kinda... [Sigh] No, forget it, fresh start, right?
[Chuckle] Your profile said you like adventure, but, uh, does ordering the weirdest thing on the menu count? [Happy] 'Cause I'm totally gonna do it.
