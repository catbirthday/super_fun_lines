Character 1: You said you'd save me a seat.

760 Character 2: Oh my god, I'm so—wait, you're here! I didn't think you were gonna make it! You said you had that thing with your mom and I just assumed—

Character 1: I texted you I was coming.

761 Character 2: You did? When? I—hold on, let me check my—[groan] okay yeah, there it is. I'm literally the worst. I got here early and then Marcus started talking to me about his whole breakup drama and I just... I completely spaced.

Character 1: Right.

762 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I'm not making excuses! I mean, I am, but like, I know that's not okay. I should've saved it regardless, y'know? I even put my jacket down but then this lady asked if anyone was sitting there and I just... caved.

Character 1: You gave my seat to a stranger.

763 Character 2: I know how that sounds—it sounds terrible. It IS terrible. I'm terrible. I just, she seemed really tired and I thought—no, actually, I wasn't thinking. That's the problem. [nervous laugh] I literally wasn't thinking at all.

Character 1: I had to stand in the back for twenty minutes.

764 Character 2: Wait, you've been here for twenty—oh god, why didn't you text me? I would've gotten up or—or found you somewhere else to sit or something!

Character 1: I did text you.

765 Character 2: You... oh. Oh no. [quieter] My phone's been on silent because of the presentation. I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, I feel awful. This is exactly the kind of thing I always do and I hate it—I hate that I'm like this.

Character 1: Yeah, well. Me too.

766 Character 2: That's—okay, I deserved that. But listen, can I at least—there's gonna be a break in like ten minutes and I'll get up, you can have my seat for the second half? Please?

Character 1: Whatever. It's fine.

767 Character 2: It's not fine though! You're clearly upset and you have every right to be. I promised I'd—wait wait, actually, y'know what? Let me just get up now. Seriously, take my seat.

Character 1: Don't make a scene. Just... next time, remember.

768 Character 2: I will. I swear I will. I'm gonna—I'm literally putting like five reminders in my phone right now so this never happens again. And I'm buying you lunch after this, no arguments.

Character 1: You don't have to do that.

769 Character 2: No, I really do. I wanna make it up to you. [sigh] Besides, I kinda owe you for last time too when I forgot about the movie, so... please? Let me at least do this?

Script: 720b89b3_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: My mom knows about the therapy.

770 Character 2: Oh god. Oh no no no, listen—I can explain. Your mom called and she was asking all these questions about why you've been so quiet lately and I just—I didn't mean to say it, it just kinda slipped out.

Character 1: It slipped out.

771 Character 2: I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But she was really worried and I thought—no wait, that's not—[groan] I wasn't thinking, that's the problem. I just wanted her to know you were getting help.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

772 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I betrayed your trust and that's... that's unforgivable, I know.

Character 1: Do you even understand what you've done?

773 Character 2: I—yeah. Yeah, I do. Your parents are gonna freak out about the money and ask a million questions and probably try to get involved and—god, I'm such an idiot. [nervous laugh] I literally ruined everything you were trying to avoid.

Character 1: I specifically asked you not to tell anyone. Especially them.

774 Character 2: I know, I know you did. And I promised I wouldn't and then I—I broke that promise. There's no excuse, I just... I got nervous when she called and the words just came out before I could stop them.

Character 1: She's been calling me nonstop. Twenty-three times.

775 Character 2: Twenty-three? Oh my god. That's—I didn't think she'd—okay no, that's a lie, I should've known she'd react like this. [sigh] I'm gonna fix this, okay? I'll call her back and tell her I was wrong or confused or something.

Character 1: You think that'll work? Really?

776 Character 2: No. No, probably not. She's not gonna—once your mom knows something she doesn't just unknow it. But maybe I can like, I dunno, minimize the damage? Tell her it's just career counseling or something less... intense?

Character 1: So your solution is to lie more.

777 Character 2: That's not—ugh, you're right. That's stupid. I'm just trying to—I wanna help somehow, y'know? Make it better? But I keep making it worse and I don't know what to do.

Character 1: Maybe stop talking to my parents. Forever.

778 Character 2: Done. Absolutely done. I'll block her number if you want—actually wait, that might seem suspicious. But I won't answer anymore, I promise. And I mean it this time, like actually truly mean it, not like before when I obviously failed spectacularly.

Character 1: I need some time. To think about this. About us.

779 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, of course, take all the time you need. I just—I really hope we can get past this eventually because you mean everything to me and I... [quieter] I'm really, really sorry I hurt you.

Script: 247f0e0c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told Marcus about the promotion.

780 Character 2: I—okay, yeah, but he literally asked me if you were leaving the team. Like, directly asked. What was I supposed to say? "I dunno, maybe ask them yourself?" That would've basically confirmed it anyway.

Character 1: You could've said you didn't know.

781 Character 2: That's—come on, that's ridiculous. He knows we talk every day. He knows we're best friends. If I said I didn't know, he'd know I was lying, and then what? [Scoff] Then I'm the shady friend who lies to everyone.

Character 1: Better than the friend who can't keep a secret.

782 Character 2: Wow. Okay, that's—that's really unfair. I've kept plenty of your secrets, y'know? Remember when you were dating Jamie and didn't want anyone to know? Or—or when you failed that certification? I never said anything about those.

Character 1: Those weren't work things. This affects my job.

783 Character 2: I get that, I do, but you're acting like I just blurted it out for fun. Marcus cornered me in the break room and was like "Is it true?" What—what exactly [frustrated laugh] was my move there? Seriously, tell me what you would've done.

Character 1: I would've kept my mouth shut. Like we agreed.

784 Character 2: We didn't—okay okay, fine, we agreed I wouldn't tell people, but I didn't think that meant lying when someone asks directly. There's a difference between gossiping and—and being put on the spot. I mean, honestly, how did he even find out enough to ask?

Character 1: Does it matter?

785 Character 2: Um, yeah? Kinda does? Because if someone else is talking about it, then maybe—maybe you should be mad at them instead of me. I'm just saying.

Character 1: I'm mad at the person I actually trusted.

786 Character 2: Right. Of course. Look look, I'm sorry it went down like this, okay? I am. But I'm also getting kinda frustrated that you won't even—[sigh] you're not even trying to understand how awkward that position was for me.

Character 1: Awkward for you?

787 Character 2: Yes! For me! I'm not—I'm not the bad guy here just because I cracked under pressure. And honestly? You putting me in a position where I have to lie to our other friends isn't exactly fair either.

Character 1: I never asked you to lie. Just not volunteer information.

788 Character 2: But that's—that's the thing, I didn't volunteer it! He asked! There's a huge difference and you're just... you're ignoring that part completely. Like, I get you're mad, but you're being kinda unreasonable about this.

Character 1: Right. I'm the unreasonable one.

789 Character 2: I didn't—ugh, whatever. Look, I'm sorry your secret got out, alright? I really am. But maybe next time don't tell me something if you're gonna expect me to become some—some master deflector when people ask about it directly. That's all I'm saying.

Script: b14d8da5_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: It's been three weeks.

790 Character 2: I know, I know, okay? I keep meaning to bring it back, but like—I literally get to my car and then remember when I'm already halfway to your place. It's not on purpose.

Character 1: You said that last week.

791 Character 2: Because it's true! Look, I'm not trying to keep your stuff hostage or whatever you think is happening here. I just—my brain's been everywhere lately [frustrated laugh] and yeah, I keep forgetting.

Character 1: I need it back.

792 Character 2: And you'll get it back! I'm not saying you won't. But you're acting like I'm doing this to spite you when honestly, I've had like a million things going on and—okay, that's not an excuse, but still.

Character 1: Just bring it tomorrow.

793 Character 2: Fine, fine, I'll—wait, tomorrow? I can't tomorrow, I've got that thing I told you about weeks ago. See, this is what I mean, you're not even—[sigh] I can do Thursday.

Character 1: That's what you said about today.

794 Character 2: That's not—okay that's technically true but come on, you know me. I'm not some thief. I've borrowed stuff before and always returned it, haven't I? This one time I'm having issues and suddenly I'm unreliable?

Character 1: Three weeks isn't "one time."

795 Character 2: Look look, I get that you're frustrated, I do. But like—you could've reminded me earlier instead of just stewing about it and then ambushing me with all this disappointment, y'know?

Character 1: I did remind you. Twice.

796 Character 2: Okay but those were like, texts in passing. You didn't say it was urgent or that you were getting this upset about it. I woulda prioritized it if I knew you were gonna—if it was this important.

Character 1: Everything's always someone else's fault with you.

797 Character 2: That's—wow, that's kinda harsh actually. [scoff] I'm literally trying to explain, not make excuses. There's a difference. And honestly? You lending me something doesn't mean I'm suddenly obligated to rearrange my whole schedule.

Character 1: No. Just to return what isn't yours.

798 Character 2: You're right, you're right, I should've—but also, we're friends? Like, supposedly? And you're treating me like I'm some random person who stole from you instead of someone who just genuinely forgot during a really chaotic month.

Character 1: Thursday then. Don't forget.

799 Character 2: I won't forget, Jesus. But um, just so we're clear—this whole conversation? Kinda makes me not wanna borrow anything from you again. Which maybe that's what you want, I dunno.

Script: 2d8a8ff9_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You always have something to say about what I'm doing wrong.

800 Character 2: That's not—I don't always—look, I'm just trying to help you. Like, isn't that what friends are supposed to do? Give each other honest feedback?

Character 1: There's honest and there's constant criticism.

801 Character 2: Okay okay, but you're making it sound like I'm just tearing you down all the time, which is—that's not what's happening here. I literally only mention stuff when I think it could genuinely help you.

Character 1: Every. Single. Time.

802 Character 2: That's such an exaggeration and you know it. [Scoff] I mean, come on, last week you asked me what I thought about your presentation and I—what, I'm supposed to lie?

Character 1: I asked about the content. Not my speaking voice.

803 Character 2: But your speaking voice is part of the presentation! I'm sorry, but like—I thought you'd wanna know you were mumbling so you could fix it before the actual thing. That's being supportive.

Character 1: That's your definition of supportive?

804 Character 2: Yeah, actually, it is. Because pretending everything's perfect when it's not—that's not helping you. That's just, I dunno, enabling or whatever. And honestly? I thought you were stronger than this.

Character 1: Wow.

805 Character 2: No no no, don't—I didn't mean it like that. [Frustrated laugh] I just mean, like, we've always been straight with each other, right? That's our thing. Since when did that become a problem?

Character 1: Since it became one-sided.

806 Character 2: One-sided? Are you—okay, that's actually kind of insulting. I ask for your opinion on stuff all the time and you give it to me straight. How is this different?

Character 1: Because you ask. I don't.

807 Character 2: So I'm supposed to just watch you mess up and say nothing? Like when you were gonna wear that outfit to the interview—I should've just let you tank it?

Character 1: That was my choice to make.

808 Character 2: Fine fine, you're right, it was. But I'm also allowed to—y'know what, I care about you succeeding. [Sigh] If that makes me the bad guy here, then I guess I'm the bad guy.

Character 1: Not the bad guy. Just exhausting.

809 Character 2: That's—wow. Okay. Um, I genuinely didn't know you felt that way. I thought I was being a good friend, but apparently I've just been, what, annoying you this whole time? That's really great to know.

810 SCENARIO: waiting for their name to be called at the doctor

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, they said like fifteen minutes, but that was— that was definitely twenty minutes ago, right? I mean, I think it was twenty minutes. Unless I'm, uh, unless I'm just really bad at keeping track of time, which, let's be honest, I am.

[slightly restless]

Should I go ask? Like, is that— is that a thing people do? Just walk up and be like, "hey, um, did you forget about me?" [nervous laugh] That seems, uh, that seems kind of pushy though.

[matter-of-fact]

Maybe they're running behind. Doctors always run behind, that's like, that's like their thing, right? The person before me probably had something complicated, or— or maybe they had a lot of questions.

[second-guessing]

Although, wait, what if they did call my name and I just, um, I just didn't hear it? Oh god, what if I was looking at my phone and they— [sigh] no, no, I would've heard it. I'm sitting right here.

[resigned]

Okay, I'll give it five more minutes. Five more minutes and then I'll, uh, then I'll casually wander over there and just... figure it out.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 48f88a91 | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [breathlessly] Oh my God, is that what I think it is?! [voice rising] Let me see your hand—no, wait, is this real? [Squeals] This is actually happening right now, and I can't believe you didn't tell me immediately!

811 Character 2: [giggling uncontrollably] I know, I know! [voice trembling with joy] He proposed last night at the botanical gardens, right by the fountain where we had our first kiss. [whispers] I wanted to tell you in person, not over the phone.

Character 1: [shouting] The botanical gardens! [voice cracking] That's so perfect I could cry—actually, I am crying! [Gasps] Look at the size of that diamond! How did you keep this secret for an entire night without exploding?

812 Character 2: [through tears] I barely slept! [increasingly giddy] I kept staring at it with my phone flashlight, taking pictures from every angle. [softer] Mom's going to absolutely lose her mind when she sees this—should we call her right now?

Character 1: [shakily] We have to plan everything! [speaking rapidly] The dress, the venue, the flowers—oh my God, I'm going to be your maid of honor, right? [pleading tone] Please say yes or I'll literally die on this kitchen floor.

813 Character 2: [warmly] Of course you are! [voice breaking] Who else would I want standing next to me? [Sniffles] We've been planning our weddings since we were seven with those plastic tiaras—this time it's real diamonds and actual cake!

Character 1: [dreamily] Remember our wedding binders? [Laughs] They're still in Mom's attic with all those magazine clippings. [more excitedly] We thought we'd marry princes who'd arrive on white horses, not Dave from accounting with his Toyota!

814 Character 2: [defensively sweet] Hey, Dave from accounting turned out pretty amazing! [teasingly] He writes me poetry on sticky notes and leaves them in my lunch. [voice dropping] Plus, he looks incredible in a suit—wait until you see him as a groom.

Character 1: [quietly awed] I'm so happy for you. [voice swelling] You deserve every single beautiful moment of this. [Shaky breath] When you walk down that aisle, I promise I'll try not to sob louder than the music plays.

815 Character 2: [gently] You better not upstage me! [mock sternly] But seriously, I can't imagine doing any of this without you. [whispers emotionally] We're really grown up now, aren't we? Like, this is actually our real adult lives happening.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 778f0795 | Role: Character 1 (A)

816 Character 1: [defensive] Oh wow, you look great as always. [bitter laugh] I've been trying this new diet, but [trailing off] work's been so stressful that I keep breaking it. [quietly] Emotional eating is real, you know?

Character 2: [oblivious] Thanks! I've actually lost weight recently—[surprised] totally by accident! [cheerfully] I've been so busy with my pottery classes that I literally forget to eat sometimes. [giggle] Isn't that funny?

817 Character 1: [forced smile] Forget to eat? [incredulous] How does someone just forget? [getting louder] I think about food constantly—planning meals, counting calories, avoiding temptation. [sarcastic] Must be nice living in that magical world.

Character 2: [innocently confused] It's weird, right? [thoughtful] Yesterday I realized at 8 PM that all I'd had was coffee. [amazed whisper] My body just doesn't send hunger signals sometimes. [casually] I had to force myself to eat something.

818 Character 1: [Sharp exhale] Force yourself. [more bitterly] Meanwhile, I ate a salad for lunch and was starving an hour later. [frustrated growl] My metabolism is completely broken from years of yo-yo dieting. [defeated] Nothing works anymore.

Character 2: [sympathetic but clueless] Oh no, that sounds hard! [brightening] Have you tried intuitive eating? [enthusiastically] I just eat whatever my body wants, whenever it wants it. [dreamy sigh] It's so freeing and natural!

819 Character 1: [tense laughter] Intuitive eating? [sarcastically slow] My intuition says eat an entire pizza at midnight. [voice cracking] That's what got me here in the first place. [mumbling] Some of us don't have naturally thin intuition.

Character 2: [awkwardly] I didn't mean—[gentle voice] everyone's different, I guess. [trying to help] Oh, my trainer says muscle burns more calories! [perky] Maybe you could try weight lifting? [hopefully] It's actually really fun once you start!

820 Character 1: [exhausted tone] I've tried everything—trainers, keto, intermittent fasting. [building frustration] Spent thousands of dollars on programs and supplements. [hollow laugh] But sure, maybe weight lifting is the magic answer. [whispered] Just like everything else was supposed to be.

Character 2: [uncomfortable silence] I'm sorry. [quieter] I know I don't really get it. [sincerely] My mom always said I have my dad's metabolism—[nervous laugh] we're all string beans in his family. Genetic lottery, I guess.

821 Character 1: [long sigh] Genetic lottery. [more firmly] That's exactly what it is. [emotional] While you win that lottery, I'm fighting biology every single day. [voice breaking] And losing. Over and over again.

Character 2: [guilty whisper] You're not losing anything—you're beautiful. [rushed words] Weight doesn't determine worth, you know that, right? [gentle but awkward] Besides, you always look so put-together and confident. [trailing off] I admire that about you.

822 Character 1: [bitter snort] Put-together? [incredulous whisper] I spend forty minutes every morning choosing clothes that hide my stomach. [getting faster] Confident is just code for "carries herself well for her size." [tired] But thanks, I guess.

Character 2: [hurt] That's not what I meant at all. [defensive] I was being genuine! [softer] Look, maybe we should change the subject? [hopeful voice] Did you see that new show everyone's talking about?

823 Character 1: [dry laugh] Sure, let's change the subject. [sarcastically sweet] Right after you ordered that green juice because you're "too full" from forgetting to eat. [sighing] Yes, I saw the show. [flatly] It was fine.

Character 2: [meekly] I can order something else. [uncertain] Maybe we could share those truffle fries you like? [trying too hard] Or that chocolate lava cake! [nervous giggle] I know you mentioned craving chocolate earlier this week.

824 Character 1: [suspicious tone] Why would you order something you don't want? [accusingly] To make me feel better about eating? [louder] I don't need your pity fries, Sarah. [controlled anger] I'm capable of ordering my own food.

Character 2: [flustered] No, I just thought—[giving up] Never mind. [quietly resigned] I'll have the juice. [mumbling] And maybe we could talk about literally anything else? [pleading] Please? This used to be easier between us.

825 Character 1: [softening slightly] You're right. [heavy sigh] I'm sorry, I'm being awful. [ashamed whisper] It's just hard when everything feels so effortless for you. [steadier] Let's talk about that show—did you like the plot twist?

Character 2: [relieved exhale] The twist was insane! [warming up] I didn't see it coming at all. [gentle laugh] And hey, nothing about friendship is effortless—[sincerely] including ours. [warmly] But you're worth the effort. Always have been.

Script: 8f5781ce | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [suspiciously] So let me get this straight—my deductible is $2,500, but you're telling me [pause] I still have to pay more? [frustrated] My policy number is XK-47829-B, and I've been paying $340 monthly since, uh, 2019.

826 Customer Support: Yes, Mr. Henderson, your deductible applies per incident, not per year. [more patiently] Looking at your account here—address listed as 4782 Maple Drive—you've had three separate claims this year alone.

Character 1: [defensive] Three claims? That's—that's ridiculous! [quieter] The thing in January wasn't even my fault, and [mumbling] maybe the March incident was questionable, but still. What about my premium discount code, uh, SAVE15NOW?

827 Customer Support: I see the confusion now. That promotional code expired on 06/30/2023, and it only applied to new policies anyway. Your current rate reflects two at-fault incidents from last year.

Character 1: [incredulous] At-fault? The guy at 1847 Pine Street literally backed into ME! [louder] I have the police report, case number 2023-A-9847! [groans] This is exactly why people hate insurance companies.

828 Customer Support: Sir, I'm reviewing incident report 2023-A-9847 right now. It shows you were, um, parked in a no-parking zone when Mr. Johnson's vehicle made contact at approximately 2:47 PM.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, so now being parked for two minutes makes it MY fault? [agitated] Your supervisor—what's her name, Rebecca something—she promised me [pause] my rate wouldn't go above $400!

829 Customer Support: Rebecca Martinez did note that in your file on 08/15. However, that was contingent on no additional claims, and you filed another one on 09/22 for $3,200 in damages.

Character 1: [exasperated] That was a deer! A DEER hit my car at mile marker 42 on Route 9! [pleading] How is that—[chuckles bitterly] are you seriously counting acts of God against me now?

830 Customer Support: Comprehensive claims like wildlife collisions don't affect fault ratings, you're right. Actually, checking your member ID J-5578-K, you might qualify for our accident forgiveness program if you complete form AF-2024 by December 31st.

Character 1: [frustrated] This is the third time you've rescheduled my appointment. [sighs heavily] I had to take off work—again—and now you're telling me [getting louder] next week doesn't work either?

831 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, Mrs. Peterson. We've had an unexpected emergency with Dr. Miller's schedule, but I can offer you priority booking for tomorrow at eight-thirty.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, how generous. [pause] Tomorrow at eight-thirty? [exasperated] Do you think I just sit around waiting for you to decide when I can fix my tooth?

832 Customer Support: [calmly] I know this isn't ideal, and we're truly sorry. If tomorrow doesn't work, we have... um, let me see... [briskly] Thursday at noon or Friday at four-fifteen?

Character 1: [incredulous] Thursday? Friday? [groans] This tooth has been killing me for two weeks while you people play musical chairs with appointments!

833 Customer Support: I hear you're in pain, that must be awful. Would you like me to check if Dr. Kim has any cancellations today? She could see you for an emergency evaluation.

Character 1: [bitterly] An evaluation? [scoffs] I don't need someone to tell me it hurts—I need it fixed! [more firmly] I've been a patient there for twelve years.

834 Customer Support: You're absolutely right, twelve years is a long time. [speaking faster] Let me speak with the office manager... actually, Dr. Miller just had a cancellation for three o'clock today!

Character 1: [skeptically] Today at three? [sighs] And what happens when I drive all the way there and you cancel that too? [quieter] I'm honestly thinking about switching dentists.

835 Customer Support: Please don't do that, Mrs. Peterson. I'm blocking this appointment personally and I'll call you an hour before to confirm. We'll also waive your copay for the inconvenience.

Character 1: [surprised] Waive the copay? [pause] Well... that's something, I suppose. [reluctantly] Fine, three o'clock today, but this better not happen again.

836 Customer Support: [relieved] Thank you for giving us another chance. You're confirmed for three o'clock, and I'm... I'm making a note about the copay right now. Is that same cell number good?

Character 1: [tiredly] Yes, same number. [chuckles dryly] You know, I've memorized your hold music by now. [more seriously] Three strikes and you're out, understood?

837 Customer Support: Absolutely understood. I'm also going to email you confirmation right now, and I've flagged your account for VIP handling going forward.

Character 1: [skeptically] VIP handling? [snorts] Is that what you tell everyone after the third reschedule? [pause] Whatever, just don't cancel on me again.

838 Customer Support: It's not just words, I promise. You'll get reminder texts, priority scheduling, and [more slowly] my direct extension if there are ever any issues.

Character 1: [considering] Your direct extension? [softer] Alright, that's... actually helpful. [sighs] I really do need this tooth looked at today.

839 Customer Support: We'll take excellent care of you at three. Dr. Miller is fantastic with emergency cases, and he'll make sure you leave pain-free today.

Character 1: [resigned] I hope so. [pause] Three o'clock then. [more firmly] And I better get that confirmation email within five minutes or I'm calling back.

840 Customer Support: It's already sent, check your inbox! We'll see you at three, Mrs. Peterson, and thank you for your patience with us today.

841 [Whisper] Oh god, this is, uh, this is definitely not the bathroom. [Fast] Sorry, sorry, I'll just—yeah, leaving now!

842 [Laugh] Well, this is awkward—I was looking for conference room B and somehow ended up in what looks like... is this a yoga class?

843 [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Groan] Third door I've tried and I still can't find the stupid supply closet.

844 [Slow] Wait a minute, this doesn't look like—oh no. [Tsk] I'm on the wrong floor again, aren't I?

845 [Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect, just walked into someone's private office while they're on a video call—this day just keeps getting better. [Sigh]

846 [Happy] Oh my gosh, I didn't know we had a game room! [Chuckle] I mean, I'm supposed to be in accounting, but this is way cooler!

847 [Fast] Nope, nope, nope, backing out slowly—pretend you didn't see me eating lunch in here, okay?

848 [Disappointed] I thought this was gonna be the break room, but it's just another conference room. [Slow] Why does this building have, like, seventeen identical doors?

849 [Shout] WHOOPS! [Laugh] [Fast] Didn't mean to interrupt your presentation—I'll just, um, yeah, bye!

850 [Sad] I'm so lost, I don't even—I've been wandering around for like twenty minutes trying to find HR. [Sigh]

851 Everyone just, uh, keep doing what you're doing—I literally have no idea where I am right now. [Chuckle] [Whisper] So embarrassing.

852 [Angry] [Fast] This is ridiculous, the room numbers make absolutely no sense—who puts 201 next to 247?

853 [Happy] You know what, I'm kinda glad I walked in here by mistake 'cause this birthday cake looks amazing! [Laugh]

854 [Sarcastic] Sure, why not, let's just barge into the CEO's office—what's the worst that could happen, right? [Tsk] [Disappointed] I'm so fired.

855 [Whisper] [Slow] I'm gonna back away really slowly and hope nobody notices I just walked into their therapy session.

856 Is this not—wait, hold on, I thought today's meeting was in here? [Fast] Unless I got the day wrong, which would be, um, super embarrassing.

857 [Sad] [Slow] I just wanted to find somewhere quiet to make a phone call and now I'm interrupting what looks like a really serious meeting.

858 [Shout] OH! [Fast] Sorry, sorry—thought this was empty, didn't see you there in the dark! [Laugh] Nearly gave me a heart attack!

859 [Disappointed] Great, I've literally walked into a supply closet. [Sarcastic] Yeah, this is exactly where I wanted to end up after getting lost for ten minutes.

860 [Chuckle] Honestly, at this point I'm just gonna pretend I meant to come in here—fake it 'til you make it, y'know?

861 SCENARIO: Frustrated about a wrong hotel room, then getting upgraded for the trouble

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my God, you will not believe what happened at the hotel today. So I get there, right? I'm exhausted from the flight, I just want to— I just want to crash, and they give me this room that's like— it's basically a closet. 

[annoyed]

Like the pictures online showed this nice queen bed, decent space, whatever. But I walk in and there's literally construction noise right outside the window, the AC is broken, and the bed is like— [scoff] it's a twin. A twin bed! I'm paying two hundred dollars a night for a twin bed.

[building anger]

So I march back down to the front desk and I'm like, this is not what I booked. This is not— and the guy is just like "sorry, we're fully booked" with this like, dead expression. Zero help. I'm thinking I'm gonna have to find another hotel or sleep on the floor or—

[surprised]

Wait, hold on. The manager is— someone's calling me right now actually. Let me just— hello?

[pause - listening]

[amazed]

Oh wow. Okay, so apparently they just had a cancellation in their penthouse suite? And they want to move me up there for free because of the mix-up.

[delighted] [slightly guilty]

I mean— [laugh] I guess getting angry actually worked out? I feel kind of bad for yelling at that poor desk guy now, but... penthouse suite!
