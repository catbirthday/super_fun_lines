Script: 5e0a1ad3_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You just stood there.

1073 Character 2: I know, I know—I'm so sorry. I just, I completely froze up when your ex started talking about the breakup and I didn't—I should've jumped in, I know that.

Character 1: Three whole minutes of him telling everyone about our "issues."

1074 Character 2: Oh god, was it really three minutes? It felt like—okay no, you're right, it was forever. I kept trying to think of something to say but my brain just [nervous laugh] completely shut down, y'know?

Character 1: You promised you'd have my back.

1075 Character 2: I did! I mean—I do! I always have your back, I swear, but when he started going into all those details I just—I panicked. Like, literally couldn't form words. Which is ironic because usually I can't shut up, right?

Character 1: Right.

1076 Character 2: Wait wait wait, don't—please don't be like this. I'm trying to—I wanna explain but I know how badly I messed up. Everyone was just staring and I felt like if I said something it might make it worse? But that's—that's not an excuse.

Character 1: It couldn't have been worse.

1077 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right. I should've just, I dunno, spilled my drink or pretended to choke or literally anything other than standing there like an idiot while you were drowning.

Character 1: A fake emergency would've been nice.

1078 Character 2: I actually—okay this is gonna sound so stupid but I kept thinking about faking a phone call? But then I was like, what if it's too obvious, and then—ugh, I just overthought everything instead of actually helping. [groan] I'm the worst friend ever.

Character 1: Not the worst. Just... disappointing.

1079 Character 2: That's somehow worse? Like, honestly, I'd rather be the worst than disappointing. I just—I keep replaying it in my head and thinking of all the things I should've said or done and I can't—I can't stop kicking myself for it.

Character 1: I had to excuse myself to the bathroom. To cry.

1080 Character 2: Oh no. Oh no no no, I didn't—I didn't know you cried. That makes me feel even more terrible, if that's possible. I should've followed you, or—wait, did you want me to follow you?

Character 1: I wanted you to stop him before it got to that point.

1081 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right and I—there's no excuse. I failed you when you needed me most and that's just... that's not okay. I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better, I promise. Like, we can practice scenarios or have a code word or something?

Character 1: Maybe just... don't freeze next time?

1082 Character 2: Yeah. Yes. Definitely no freezing. And hey, if he ever tries to corner you again, I'll—I'll literally throw myself between you two if I have to. [softer] I really am sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply sorry. You deserved better from me.

Script: d8c6729c_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three hours. I waited three hours.

1083 Character 2: I know, I know, okay? My phone died and I—look, I completely spaced it. But it's not like I did it on purpose, I had like a million things going on today.

Character 1: Right. A million things.

1084 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. You're acting like I'm making excuses but I literally had my mom's doctor appointment, then work called me in early, and yeah, I forgot to charge my phone. [Sigh] I'm human, okay?

Character 1: I almost missed my interview.

1085 Character 2: Wait, what? You didn't—you didn't tell me it was for an interview! You just said you needed a ride downtown, how was I supposed to know it was that important?

Character 1: Would it have mattered?

1086 Character 2: Are you seriously—yes! Yes, it would've mattered! I would've like, set three alarms or something. You can't just [frustrated laugh] expect me to read your mind about what's important and what's not.

Character 1: I shouldn't have to rank my needs for you to show up.

1087 Character 2: That's not—okay okay, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you'd actually communicated with me instead of just assuming I'd remember every single thing, maybe—maybe this wouldn't have happened.

Character 1: You wrote it down. I watched you.

1088 Character 2: I write everything down! I've got like—my whole calendar is full, and sometimes things just... slip through. I'm not perfect, alright? And honestly, you're kinda being unfair here.

Character 1: I'm being unfair?

1089 Character 2: Yeah! Yeah, you are! You're sitting here acting like I'm the worst friend in the world when—when have I ever let you down before this? Name one time. [Scoff] But no, one mistake and suddenly I'm unreliable.

Character 1: You left me stranded.

1090 Character 2: I didn't—ugh, I didn't mean to leave you stranded! That's the whole point! My phone was dead, I couldn't even call you when I realized. What was I supposed to do, drive around the entire city looking for you?

Character 1: You could've remembered in the first place.

1091 Character 2: Okay fine, fine, you're right. I should've remembered. But I'm not gonna stand here and—and grovel when you won't even acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, shit happens sometimes and it's not about you.

Character 1: Took an Uber. Cost me sixty bucks.

1092 Character 2: I'll—look, I'll pay you back for the Uber, obviously. But I'm not gonna apologize for being human. And if you wanna stay mad about this forever, then I guess—I dunno what else to tell you.

Script: 505cbfc3_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three months. You kept it from me for three months.

1093 Character 2: I—yeah, okay, I did, but Jake specifically asked me not to tell anyone. Like, he made me promise, and I couldn't just—you know I couldn't break that.

Character 1: I'm not "anyone."

1094 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not what I meant. You know that's not what I meant. But he was really messed up about it and he needed someone to just... listen without it becoming this whole thing.

Character 1: This whole thing? Is that what our friendship is?

1095 Character 2: No! God, no, that's—[frustrated laugh] you're twisting my words. I'm saying he was in a bad place and he trusted me with something personal. What was I supposed to do, immediately run to you?

Character 1: You tell me everything. I tell you everything. That's what we do.

1096 Character 2: Okay okay, but this wasn't my secret to tell! It was Jake's thing, his—his whole situation with his dad, and honestly? I'm kinda frustrated that you can't see why I had to respect that.

Character 1: Right. Respect him, not me.

1097 Character 2: That's—ugh, that's so unfair. You're making this about you when it literally had nothing to do with you. I wasn't keeping it from you to hurt you, I was keeping it because someone asked me to. There's a difference.

Character 1: Is there?

1098 Character 2: Yes! Obviously there is! Look look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but you're acting like I—like I chose him over you or something, which is not what happened. [Sigh] At all.

Character 1: You did choose. You chose to lie to me.

1099 Character 2: I didn't lie! I just... didn't tell you one thing. One thing out of, what, hundreds? Thousands? And now you're gonna throw away our entire friendship because I kept one promise to someone else?

Character 1: You looked me in the eye. Every day. Knowing.

1100 Character 2: Yeah, and it sucked! It really really sucked, okay? But I was stuck between—between two people I care about, and I made a call. Maybe it was wrong, I dunno, but I'm not gonna apologize for trying to be a good friend to someone who needed it.

Character 1: What about being a good friend to me?

1101 Character 2: I—that's... [scoff] I am constantly a good friend to you. Constantly. And the one time, the one time I have to put someone else's trust first, you're ready to just... what, end this?

Character 1: I don't know.

1102 Character 2: Well that's—that's great. Really great. Y'know, I thought you'd at least try to understand, but apparently keeping one promise makes me the worst friend ever. Fine. Whatever.

Script: 7cb1eb2e_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: That was humiliating.

1103 Character 2: Okay, I know it didn't go how we—how I thought it would, but you gotta believe me, I really thought you two would hit it off. Like, on paper, you're perfect for each other.

Character 1: On paper.

1104 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. You know what I mean. You both love hiking, you're both into those weird documentaries, you literally have the same sense of humor. I wasn't just throwing you at some random person.

Character 1: They spent the whole night talking about their ex.

1105 Character 2: I didn't—[groan] I didn't know they were still hung up on them, okay? Last time we talked, they said they were totally over it. Like, completely done. How was I supposed to know they were lying?

Character 1: Maybe by actually knowing them before setting me up?

1106 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not fair. I've known them for like three years. They seemed ready, they told me they wanted to meet someone new. I mean, they literally asked if I knew anyone.

Character 1: And you picked me to be the rebound experiment.

1107 Character 2: No! God, no, that's not what—you're twisting this. I genuinely, honestly thought you'd be good together. [frustrated laugh] I'm sorry it sucked, I am, but I wasn't trying to use you as some kind of test dummy.

Character 1: Sure felt like it.

1108 Character 2: Okay okay, I get that you're pissed, but you're acting like I deliberately sabotaged you or something. I was trying to help. Maybe I should've—I dunno, vetted them better or whatever, but my intentions were good.

Character 1: Your intentions made me sit through two hours of trauma dumping.

1109 Character 2: And that sucks! It does, I'm not saying it doesn't. But like—ugh, you know what? You could've left. You could've texted me for an out, you could've just walked away, but you didn't.

Character 1: I was trying to be polite. For your sake.

1110 Character 2: For my—[scoff] okay, so now I'm responsible for you being too nice to leave a bad date? That's on me too? Come on.

Character 1: You vouched for them. Said they were "amazing."

1111 Character 2: Because I thought—I still think they're a good person, they're just... obviously not ready. And yeah, I missed that, fine fine, I screwed up there. But I wasn't being malicious about it.

Character 1: I need better friends.

1112 Character 2: That's—wow. Okay. If that's how you wanna be about it. I try to do something nice, it goes badly, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever. Real proportionate response there.

Script: 9892f82b_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I matched.

1113 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you matched? Like, THE match? Oh my god, did you—did you get your results already?

Character 1: Hopkins. Neurology.

1114 Character 2: HOPKINS? Are you—[Gasp] that's your number one! That's literally your dream program! Oh my god, I'm gonna cry, I'm actually gonna cry right now.

Character 1: Yeah. Still processing.

1115 Character 2: Processing? Babe, you just got into like, the best neuro program in the country! This is—this is everything you've been working for since, what, sophomore year?

Character 1: Since I was twelve, actually.

1116 Character 2: Twelve? You've wanted this since you were twelve? That's—okay that's making me even more emotional. Did you tell your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it.

Character 1: Haven't called them. Scared it's not real.

1117 Character 2: No no no, it's real, it's definitely real! You—I mean, you logged in yourself, right? You saw it with your own eyes?

Character 1: Three times. Keep checking.

1118 Character 2: [Laugh] Of course you do. That's so—that's so you. But like, honestly? After everything you've done—all those insane hours, the research, that brutal attending who made you cry that one time—you earned this.

Character 1: What if I can't handle it?

1119 Character 2: Okay, um, excuse me? You literally just survived med school while publishing two papers and somehow still remembered my birthday every year. You're gonna—you're gonna crush this.

Character 1: It's Baltimore though. Far from everyone.

1120 Character 2: Yeah, it's... it's far. [Sigh] But like, we'll visit! And honestly? Baltimore's kinda cool now, apparently. My cousin lives there and she's always posting these cute coffee shops and stuff.

Character 1: You'd visit?

1121 Character 2: Are you kidding? Obviously I'm visiting! I'm already planning like—okay wait, when do you start? July? I'm literally gonna help you move and everything.

Character 1: Thanks. Means a lot.

1122 Character 2: Stop, you're gonna make me cry again. But seriously though—Dr. Future Neurologist at Johns Hopkins? That's... that's who you are now. How completely insane is that?

1123 SCENARIO: trying to remember the word that's on the tip of their tongue

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, what is— what is that word? It's, um, it's right there, I can literally feel it, like, sitting right on my— on my tongue and I just, uh, I just can't get it out. This is so, um, so annoying.

[slightly strained]

It's the thing, you know, when you're, uh— when you're really tired but you can't sleep? Like your body's exhausted but your brain is still, um, still going and going and— [tsk] come on, what is it?

[more animated]

It starts with an I, I think? Or maybe— no, wait, maybe it's an E? Insomnia! No, that's not— that's not right, that's different. That's when you, uh, when you actually can't sleep, but this is more like—

[frustrated but focused]

Okay, okay, let me think. It's like when you're wired? But tired? Your eyes are heavy but you're still, um, you're still buzzing with energy and— [groan] this is driving me crazy.

[brightening]

Oh! Overtired! That's— no, wait, that's not quite— [pause] Oh my god, restless! No, that's not— [sigh]

[triumphant but quiet]

Wired. I'm just wired. That's, um— that's probably close enough, right? Sometimes your brain just, uh, just settles for good enough.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 555ddffd | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [shaking voice] Oh my God, oh my God, it's here—the email is here! [getting faster] I can't click it, my hands are literally trembling. [Sharp inhale] What if we failed? What if all those months of studying meant nothing?

1124 Character 2: [breathlessly] Don't say that! [higher pitched] We studied together every single day, remember? [Nervous laugh] Okay, okay, let's count to three and open them at the exact same time. My heart is beating so fast I might actually pass out.

Character 1: [whispered panic] Wait, I need water first. [louder] No, forget water—I need oxygen! [Hyperventilating] One... two... I can't do this. You go first and tell me if yours is good news, then I'll know there's hope for mine.

1125 Character 2: [frantically] Are you insane? [slower, trembling] If I passed and you didn't, I'd feel horrible. [Gasp] Let's just rip off the band-aid together. Put your finger on your screen. Ready? Here we go—clicking now!

Character 1: [screaming] I PASSED! [sobbing] Oh my God, I actually passed! [more quietly] Three years of law school, six months of bar prep, and it's finally over. Look at my name on that pass list—it's really there!

1126 Character 2: [stunned whisper] Mine says... [explosive joy] PASS! WE'RE LAWYERS! [Shrieking laugh] We actually did it! Remember when we thought we'd never understand constitutional law? And now look at us—actual attorneys! This is insane!

Character 1: [through tears] My mom is going to lose her mind. [sniffling] She already bought a frame for the certificate. [Giggling uncontrollably] Should we call everyone now or wait until we stop shaking? I can barely hold my phone steady.

1127 Character 2: [giddy] Let them wait! [more seriously] This moment is ours first. [Whooping] We survived the worst exam known to mankind! Remember day two when we both cried in the parking lot? Worth every tear now!

Character 1: [calming down] I literally thought I failed after the essays. [laughing] Contracts destroyed me. [Deep exhale] But somehow, some way, we made it through. We're going to be the best lawyers this city has ever seen.

1128 Character 2: [emotionally] Six years of friendship, three years of study groups. [choking up] We dreamed about this day so many times. [Soft laugh] Now we need to plan the biggest celebration party in history. Champagne is definitely not enough!

Character 1: [determined] First, we're framing these results. [excitedly building] Then we're getting those business cards printed immediately! [Squealing] Can you believe we can actually put "Attorney at Law" after our names now? This feels like a dream.

1129 Character 2: [in disbelief] I keep refreshing to make sure it's real. [more confidently] It still says pass! [Cackling] Remember Professor Williams who said we asked too many questions? Bet those questions helped us pass this beast!

Character 1: [nostalgic tone] All those flashcards, practice exams, outline sessions. [getting louder] Every sacrifice was worth this exact moment! [Contented sigh] My student loans suddenly feel less crushing knowing I can actually practice law now.

1130 Character 2: [philosophically] You know what's crazy? [building excitement] Yesterday we were just law graduates, today we're actual lawyers! [Breathless laugh] The imposter syndrome is hitting hard, but who cares—we earned this title fair and square!

Character 1: [quietly intense] Promise me something right now. [more firmly] We'll never forget how this feels—this pure joy, this relief. [Shaky breath] When we're stressed at our firms, we'll remember we conquered the bar exam together.

1131 Character 2: [solemnly] I promise. [brightening up] We should take a screenshot of these results immediately! [Giggling] Future us will need proof that this happiness existed. Also, should we update LinkedIn now or wait until tomorrow?

Character 1: [mischievously] Update it now! [dramatically] Let everyone see it at 3 PM on a Tuesday! [Snorting laugh] "Pleased to announce I passed the bar exam" sounds so professional when inside I'm literally screaming with joy.

1132 Character 2: [mockingly formal] "I am humbled to share..." [breaking character, laughing] Who are we kidding? [Enthusiastically] I'm posting "I'M A LAWYER" in all caps with fifty exclamation points! Humble can wait until tomorrow!

Character 1: [winding down] My adrenaline is finally dropping. [peaceful] This morning feels like a year ago. [Soft chuckle] We woke up as nervous wrecks and now we're going to sleep as lawyers. What a plot twist.

1133 Character 2: [warmly] Thank you for going through this with me. [getting emotional] Having a study partner who became family made everything bearable. [Happy sigh] Now let's go get those drinks we've been promising ourselves since day one of bar prep!

Script: 5ef1a92c | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I've been trying to get my refund for flight AA-2847 for three weeks now. [raising voice] My confirmation number is K7B9M2X, and I paid $847.50 [pause] [exasperated] yet nobody seems to know where my money is!

1134 Customer Support: I do apologize for the inconvenience, sir. [calmly] Let me pull up your reservation—could you please verify the email address on file? We'll definitely get this sorted out for you today.

Character 1: [impatiently] It's james.morrison@email.com, same as always. [sighs heavily] I've called five times already, talked to—let me see—agents 4521, 7789, and 3302. [more angrily] Each one promised a refund within 7-10 business days!

1135 Customer Support: I can see those previous interactions here, Mr. Morrison. Your flight from JFK to LAX on March 15th was indeed cancelled. Um, it appears there was a processing error with code E-447 on your account.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh fantastic, another error code! [groans] What does E-447 even mean? [louder] I just want my eight hundred and forty-seven dollars and fifty cents back—is that really so complicated?

1136 Customer Support: [patiently] The E-447 indicates a payment verification issue, sir. I'll need to transfer you to our billing department at extension 8823. They can override this and process your refund immediately, within 24 hours actually.

Character 1: [outraged] Transfer me? TRANSFER ME? [laughs bitterly] That's what agent 3302 said last Tuesday at 2:47 PM! [desperately] Please, I'm begging you, just... just fix this yourself, can't you access billing from there?

1137 Customer Support: [understanding] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Morrison. Let me try something different—I'm escalating this to supervisor code S-99A right now. My badge number is 6674, and I'm personally flagging this for priority processing.

Character 1: [skeptically] You know what, fine, but I want confirmation. [demanding] Email me at that address—no, actually, text me at 555-0147. [firmly] And I want a reference number, a real one this time, not another made-up promise.

1138 Customer Support: Absolutely, your new reference number is RF-20240315-AAB9. [clearly] I'm sending a text confirmation now to 555-0147, and [helpfully] you'll receive an email within 4 hours showing the refund pending to your card ending in... let me confirm, 7782?

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, no—it ends in 7728, not 7782. [worried] Oh god, have you guys been trying to refund the wrong card? [groans loudly] That would explain everything, wouldn't it?

1139 Customer Support: Let me update that immediately—7728, correct. Actually, this might be why the previous attempts failed. The system shows your refund can now process to the correct card within 2-3 business days maximum.

Character 1: [cautiously hopeful] Okay, so card ending 7728, reference RF-20240315-AAB9. [sighs] If this doesn't work, I'm filing with the Better Business Bureau. [more calmly] Your supervisor's direct line, what is it, just in case?

1140 Customer Support: [professionally] Our escalation line is 1-800-555-9900, ask for Team Lead Jennifer Martinez. But Mr. Morrison, I've added priority flag P-1 to your case. You should see the full $847.50 by Friday at the latest.

Character 1: [skeptically] Priority flag P-1, sure, whatever that means. [tiredly] Look, I've recorded this entire call, badge 6674, March 20th, 3:15 PM Eastern. [firmly] I expect that text confirmation within the next ten minutes, understood?

1141 Customer Support: [assuringly] The text is being sent as we speak, sir. [helpful] It'll include your reference number, my badge ID, and the expected refund date. I truly apologize for all the trouble you've experienced with this.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well, I just got the text, so... that's something at least. [cautiously] It says pending approval though—what does that mean? [nervously] This isn't going to be another three-week runaround, is it?

1142 Customer Support: Pending approval is just our standard verification process, takes about 2 hours. Since it's marked P-1 priority, it bypasses the regular queue. [confidently] By 5:30 PM today, you'll get another text saying "approved for processing."

Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll wait for the 5:30 text then. [sighs deeply] But I swear, if this doesn't work... [trailing off] I still have my lawyer's number from the last airline fiasco—Robert Chen at 555-8823.

1143 Customer Support: [understanding] I've documented everything in your file, Mr. Morrison, including today's corrections. My shift ends at 6 PM, but I'm personally monitoring your case. Thank you for your patience, and again, reference RF-20240315-AAB9 for any follow-up.

Script: 0a9e04ff | Role: Customer Support

1144 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Appliance World, this is Sarah speaking. How can I help you today—do you have an order number I can look up for you?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, it's order 47829. [sighs heavily] I ordered a dishwasher three weeks ago and was told it would arrive last Monday. [more agitated] Where is it?

1145 Customer Support: Let me just... pull that up for you right away. Oh, I see here it's showing as backordered. Unfortunately the manufacturer has delayed shipment.

Character 1: [incredulous] Backordered? Nobody called me! [louder] I've had contractors waiting, I've—I've rearranged my entire kitchen schedule. [exasperated] This is completely unacceptable.

1146 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, absolutely, and you're right—someone should have contacted you. [more firmly] Let me check our inventory system to see if we have any alternatives in stock.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, alternatives. [groans] I specifically chose that model for the dimensions—it's the only one that fits. [desperately] When will mine actually arrive?

1147 Customer Support: [hesitantly] The system shows... well, it's indicating another two to three weeks. [hurriedly] But wait, I can escalate this to our priority fulfillment team, they sometimes have access to different stock.

Character 1: [shocked] Three more weeks? [voice rising] That's over a month and a half total! [firmly] I need to speak to a manager, this is—this is beyond ridiculous at this point.

1148 Customer Support: Of course, let me get my supervisor right away. Before I do though, I can offer you fifteen percent off for the inconvenience, plus free installation when it arrives.

Character 1: [skeptically] Fifteen percent doesn't fix my kitchen being torn apart. [sighs] But... fine, get the manager. [resigned] And that discount better be guaranteed in writing.

1149 Customer Support: Absolutely, I'll email you the confirmation right now while you hold. My manager Jennifer will be with you in just a moment—she has more authority to expedite orders.

Character 1: [impatiently] You know what, while we're waiting—can you at least explain why nobody called? [accusingly] Your website says customers are notified within twenty-four hours of any delays.

1150 Customer Support: You're absolutely right, that's our policy. I'm seeing a note here that... hmm, the automated system flagged an incorrect phone number. Though we should have emailed regardless.

Character 1: [angrily] My phone number hasn't changed in ten years! [loudly] This is just excuse after excuse. [demanding] What compensation is your manager authorized to provide?

1151 Customer Support: She can go up to twenty-five percent, sometimes thirty for situations like this. Plus she has direct contacts at the warehouse who might locate your specific model faster.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well, that's... something at least. [sighs] Look, I just need this resolved—my contractor charges me whether he's working or waiting. [frustrated] This delay is costing me hundreds.

1152 Customer Support: I completely understand, these timeline disruptions cascade into everything else. [more quickly] Jennifer's just finishing another call—she'll be about thirty more seconds, and I promise she'll make this right.

Character 1: [wearily] Fine, I'll wait. [muttering] Though at this point I'm considering just canceling and going to your competitor. [pointedly] HomeMax promised same-week delivery on the same model.

1153 Customer Support: Please don't cancel just yet—Jennifer can actually match competitor timelines in many cases. She has override codes for express shipping that I don't have access to. [hopefully] Just give her two minutes?

Character 1: [reluctantly] Alright, two minutes. [firmly] But if she can't guarantee delivery by next Friday, I'm done. [exhausted] This has been an absolute nightmare from start to finish.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

1154 [Disappointed] Look, I wanted to go, I really did, but when Dad got sick, someone had to—someone had to take over the shop. [Sigh]

1155 [Fast] [Happy] Honestly, best decision I ever made because I started my business at eighteen and now I'm doing better than, like, all my friends with degrees!

1156 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just pull forty thousand dollars out of thin air for tuition. [Tsk] That would've been nice.

1157 [Slow] I guess I just... I dunno, I never really saw myself as the academic type, you know? [Shrug]

1158 [Angry] [Shout] Why does everyone assume you're a failure if you don't have a degree? I'm doing FINE!

1159 [Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified of leaving home—like, absolutely terrified. [Sad]

1160 [Chuckle] My guidance counselor literally told me I wasn't "college material," so, uh, yeah, that kinda killed my confidence right there.

1161 [Fast] [Disappointed] I had a full scholarship lined up but then Mom—she needed help with the twins and I couldn't just leave her.

1162 [Happy] [Laugh] Dude, I went straight into coding bootcamp for three months and got hired immediately—why would I waste four years?

1163 [Slow] [Sad] The acceptance letter came the same week as the diagnosis, and suddenly college just... it didn't matter anymore.

1164 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, because sitting in a classroom learning theory while my friends were out there actually doing stuff seemed super appealing.

1165 Trade school made way more sense—I mean, plumbers make bank and nobody talks about that, right? [Chuckle]

1166 [Angry] I'm so tired of explaining this to people like it's some kind of—like I failed at life or something. [Groan]

1167 [Whisper] [Disappointed] I actually got into my dream school but, um, the financial aid fell through last minute.

1168 [Happy] Military gave me everything college would've, plus they paid ME to learn, so honestly, no regrets there! [Laugh]

1169 [Slow] You wanna know the truth? [Sad] [Sigh] I just wasn't ready—mentally, emotionally, none of it.

1170 [Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm sorry, should I have gone into massive debt to get a degree in something I'd probably hate anyway?

1171 [Disappointed] [Slow] My anxiety was so bad senior year that I couldn't even—I couldn't imagine leaving town, let alone going to college.

1172 [Shout] [Happy] I got discovered at seventeen and went straight to touring—college can wait, but that opportunity couldn't!

1173 [Groan] [Angry] Every family dinner it's the same question, and I'm just—I'm done justifying my life choices to everyone, okay?

1174 SCENARIO: Complaining about a bad restaurant review they left, then realizes while talking that they went to the wrong location

==================================================

[frustrated]

Ugh, so I left this scathing review for Marco's yesterday and now I'm like— I'm actually kind of regretting it? Like I feel bad, but also they totally deserved it.

[annoyed]

The service was just awful, like our server literally forgot about us for like forty minutes, and when the food finally came it was cold and— [scoff] —and the pasta was like, mushy? Like completely overcooked.

So I wrote this whole thing about how disappointing it was, especially for the price point, you know?

[defensive]

But now my coworker's like "oh that's so unlike them, they're usually amazing" and I'm like— well I can only review my experience, right? Like I'm not making this stuff up.

[confused] [slower]

Wait, she's asking me which location I went to and I'm like... the one on Fifth Street? But she's saying there's no Marco's on Fifth Street, there's only— 

[realization dawning]

Oh my god. Oh my GOD. [nervous laugh] I think I went to Mario's. Not Marco's. Mario's is the one on Fifth Street.

[mortified]

I just left this brutal review for the wrong restaurant. Like completely wrong restaurant. Marco's is probably sitting there like "what is this person even talking about?" [groan] I have to delete this immediately, this is so embarrassing.
