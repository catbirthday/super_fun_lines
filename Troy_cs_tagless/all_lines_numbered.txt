1  I—okay, yeah, I mentioned it, but I honestly thought it would help you! You've been complaining for months about not getting recognized and I just wanted to—I dunno, give you a boost.
2  Look look, I get that you're upset, but you're acting like I sabotaged you or something. I was literally trying to help. Marcus even seemed really interested when I brought up all the extra hours you've been putting in.
3  What? No no no, that's not—I specifically said you didn't know I was talking to him. [scoff] I made sure he knew this was just me looking out for you.
4  Okay, fine, maybe I should've asked first, but come on—you would've said no. You always say no when people try to help you with this stuff. And then you just sit there being miserable about it.
5  That's not—ugh, you're twisting this. I saw an opportunity at the happy hour and I took it. Sue me for actually [frustrated laugh] caring about your career apparently.
6  You're being dramatic. Marcus likes you—he's always liked you. I mean, yeah, maybe the timing wasn't perfect, but I really don't think it's gonna be as bad as you're making it out to be.
7  And you don't get to just—okay okay, I messed up the approach, fine. But you're acting like I'm some kind of enemy here when I was literally just trying to have your back.
8  I—yeah, okay, fair. [sigh] But also, like, having your back sometimes means pushing you when you won't push yourself. That's what friends do. Or at least that's what I thought we did for each other.
9  Then how? Seriously, tell me how I'm supposed to help when you won't—when you never let anyone help. I'm sorry I didn't do it perfectly, but I'm kinda tired of watching you get passed over because you're too proud to advocate for yourself.
10  Yeah. Yeah, it is. And maybe I crossed a line, I dunno. But don't pretend like you wouldn't have done something similar if you thought—whatever. I was trying to help. That's all.
11  What? That's—that's not even true. I don't know where you're getting that from, honestly. We're just friends who do stuff together, I'm not trying to compete with anyone.
12  Oh come on, that's not—I've been wanting to do a marathon for like, years. It had nothing to do with your 5K, I mean, those aren't even the same thing. You're reading way too much into this.
13  Are you serious right now? [scoff] I'm supposed to not advance my career because you got promoted first? That's—I can't believe you're actually saying this to me. We work in completely different departments!
14  Because I was inspired! That's what friends do—they inspire each other, they push each other to be better. I didn't realize that was like, a crime or whatever. I thought you'd be happy for me.
15  Look look, I get that maybe—okay, maybe sometimes I get a little carried away trying to keep up, but it's not because I'm trying to beat you or make you feel bad. I just... I dunno, I see you doing cool stuff and I wanna do cool stuff too.
16  Well I'm sorry you feel that way, but like—[frustrated laugh] I'm not gonna apologize for having ambitions. That's not fair. You're basically asking me to make myself smaller so you feel better.
17  Then what? What do you want from me? Because it sounds like—it really sounds like you want me to just... not try at things. Or only try at things you don't care about, which is kinda messed up, honestly.
18  I'm not—okay okay, fine. Maybe I do get a little competitive sometimes. But it's not like, malicious or anything. It's just how I'm wired, y'know? I see someone doing something and I think "I could probably do that too."
19  You're—you're twisting everything I say. [sigh] Yes, fine, with you too. But that doesn't mean I see our entire friendship as some kind of competition. It just means I... I dunno, I admire you and wanna push myself the way you push yourself.
20  That's not—ugh, okay, if that's how you wanna see it, then I guess I can't change your mind. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I'm some terrible person for wanting to achieve things. Maybe—maybe you should think about why it bothers you so much when I succeed at something.
21  Okay, um—yeah, I did talk to them. But it's not like I sought them out or anything. We're literally in the same friend group, what am I supposed to do, just ignore them completely?
22  That's—come on, that's not realistic. We were both at Mark's birthday thing, standing in the same circle and—I mean, everyone would've noticed if I just [scoff] turned my back or whatever. That would've made it worse.
23  Braised short ribs. Changed it last minute.
24  The duck wasn't working. Too dry every time.
25  About two hundred people. Twelve chefs competing.
26  My knife slipped twice. Nobody noticed.
27  Had to keep plating. No time to panic.
28  Five thousand dollars. And some knife set.
29  Might fix my car. Or save it.
30  It was fine. Lucky the judges liked meat.
31  We need to talk about what you said yesterday.
32  And Sophie. And your cousin. And literally everyone else you know, apparently.
33  "Why can't you be more like Marcus with his startup?" Ring any bells?
34  Right. And Sophie's "amazing work ethic that I should learn from"?
35  You never do.
36  It's exhausting. Being constantly measured against everyone else in your life.
37  Three years of it, actually.
38  Hard to tell when you're always talking about how much better everyone else is at everything.
39  You think I'm amazing at anything?
40  No. You don't.
41  [muttering to self] Wait, did she just say "niche" like "neesh"? I've been saying it like "nitch" this whole time. Oh no. Oh no no no. How long have I been— how long have I been saying it wrong?
42  [breathless] Oh my God, oh my God, we're alive! [nervous giggle] Did he seriously just throw his coffee at the wall? [voice cracking] I thought we were getting fired for sure when the projector died mid-presentation.
43  [whispered panic] When he started screaming about incompetence, I literally forgot how to breathe. [louder] But then YOU— [cackling] you offered him a stress ball from your purse like that would fix everything!
44  [exhausted sigh] Twenty years. [flat tone] He said he'd been waiting twenty years for this presentation. [hysterical laugh] We gave him Comic Sans headers and a fire hazard instead. This is how careers die.
45  [mock serious] At least we maintained eye contact during the meltdown. [voice shaking] Very professional of us. [burst of laughter] Even when he called us "disappointments to capitalism itself"—that was oddly poetic for pure rage.
46  [sudden realization] Wait, wait, did we even save the file? [panic rising] The backup is on my desktop but— [relieved exhale] Oh who cares, we're probably banned from the building anyway after today's performance.
47  [disbelieving whisper] Did security actually escort us out? [normal volume] Or was that just a very aggressive goodbye? [confused giggle] The guard seemed sympathetic when he handed us our visitor badges back, so that's something.
48  [rapid words] The conference room still smelled like burnt plastic when we left. [amazed] How is that even possible from one projector? [tired laugh] Maintenance is going to hate us forever, assuming we ever get back in.
49  [soft wonder] My hands finally stopped shaking. [steadier] Only took forty-five minutes and probable career suicide. [bitter laugh] Mom's going to love hearing about this at Thanksgiving. "How's work, sweetie?" "Well, funny story..."
50  [resigned acceptance] Tomorrow's problem. [firm] Right now, we survived the Peterson apocalypse together. [warming up] That bonds us for life, you realize? [chuckle] We're disaster sisters now. There's no going back from this.
51  [suddenly urgent] Oh no, the parking meter! [frantic] We've been decomposing here for an hour! [groaning laugh] A parking ticket would be the perfect end to this nightmare. The universe's final little joke today.
52  I understand your frustration, sir, let me pull up your account. [apologetically] Could you please verify the last four digits of your social security number and your mother's maiden name? These freezes are usually triggered by our security system for account protection.
53  I see here that there were three suspicious transactions from IP address 192.168.45.209 on Tuesday. [cautiously] Someone attempted transfers totaling $8,500 to accounts in, um... Lagos, Nigeria. Did you authorize these?
54  Sir, please lower your voice, I'm trying to help you here. The system shows login attempts from your registered device, MAC address 3C-7B-96-A4-22-F1. [measured tone] Were you perhaps using public WiFi or—
55  I need to escalate this to our fraud department, reference number FRD-2024-78453. [apologetically] They'll need 48 to 72 hours to investigate, and then— I know it's not what you want to hear, but—
56  Sir, threatening to leave won't speed up the process. Your security is our priority, and these protocols exist for a reason. However, I can issue you a temporary access code—TMP-8847-QRX—for limited withdrawals up to $500.
57  My name is Sandra Mitchell, employee ID 44729, and my supervisor is Mr. Davies. But he'll tell you the same thing—Policy 47-B clearly states frozen accounts require full investigation. Sir, have you checked for any malware on your devices?
58  Let me try one more thing—I'm checking alternative verification through your loan history. You had an auto loan, account LA-2019-6634, paid off early? This might allow me to partially lift the restriction.
59  Okay, I'm seeing green flags here, your employment with TechCorp since 2009 is verified. I can release up to $5,000 immediately to checking sub-account 4782-A. The rest should be available within 24 hours if fraud clears it.
60  I'm adding priority flag PRY-1147 to your case right now. Call this direct line—1-800-555-8924 extension 4429—tomorrow at 9 AM sharp. Ask for Janet in escalations, tell her Sandra pre-authorized override code X-4-Alpha.
61  No apology necessary, Mr. Thompson, I'd be upset too if my account showed $47,000 frozen. [reassuringly] Your funds are safe, we'll get this sorted. Is there anything else I can help with while you're here today?
62  [apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. Let me pull up your service history right away—I see here multiple visits for engine stalling. We're going to get to the bottom of this today, I promise.
63  [calmly] I hear you, and you're absolutely right to be upset. Here's what we're going to do differently—our master technician will personally inspect it, not just run diagnostics. No charge for today's inspection, obviously.
64  You're right, he should have been involved earlier—that's on us. Between you and me, we've had some staffing changes that affected our process. But John, our senior tech, he's been here fifteen years and knows these engines inside out.
65  Oh no, that must have been terrifying for both of you. I can't guarantee anything until John looks at it, but [briskly] here's what I can do—we'll provide a loaner car while we work on yours, no rental fees.
66  [quickly] John can see it this afternoon—should have answers by five. [more confidently] If it's something we've missed before, we'll make it right, including refunding previous repairs that didn't address the real issue. [firmly] That's my manager's commitment.
67  Perfect, let me get you set up with that loaner right now. It's a newer model actually, fully insured by us. And Mr. Johnson, I'm giving you my direct line—any issues, you call me personally.
68  We absolutely know, and we value that relationship immensely. That's why I'm escalating this to regional management as well—they need to know we've let you down. [quickly] This isn't just about one car anymore.
69  Not at all, that's the bare minimum you deserve. John just freed up—he can look at it in an hour actually. [more warmly] Would you like coffee while you wait, or should I have someone drive you home?
70  [indignantly] Your driving style? That's completely inappropriate—engine stalling isn't user error. I'm sorry you were told that, that's not how we should handle concerns, ever.
71  One hour for initial assessment, yes, and I'm your point person from now on. I'll text you updates as John works, so you're not left wondering. We're going to make this right, Mr. Johnson.
72  [Happy] So every single Thanksgiving, right, we all have to, um, wear these ridiculous pilgrim hats my grandma made in like 1982. [Laugh] They're falling apart but nobody's allowed to throw them away!
73  [Slow] It started when my great-grandfather came over from Italy and he—well, he couldn't afford presents, so... [Sigh] he'd hide coins in the bread.
74  [Whisper] Don't tell anyone but honestly? [Fast] I think half the family hates doing it but we're all too scared to be the first one to say something.
75  [Sarcastic] Oh yeah, nothing says "family bonding" like forcing everyone to sing that awful song Uncle Jerry wrote. [Tsk] It doesn't even rhyme properly.
76  We basically just, uh, throw flour at each other at midnight—I know, I know it sounds weird but [Chuckle] you should see my dad's face when he gets hit!
77  [Angry] Look, I've tried explaining this like fifty times already! [Groan] You gotta spin counterclockwise or grandma will literally lose her mind about it!
78  [Disappointed] The younger kids don't really, um, get why we do it anymore, y'know? [Slow] They just wanna play on their phones instead.
79  [Fast] Wait wait wait, I forgot the most important part—you absolutely cannot, and I mean cannot, eat anything until the bell rings three times! [Shout] Three times!
80  My mom insists we all have to share our—actually, it's kinda embarrassing but [Sad] we share our biggest failure of the year first. [Sigh]
81  [Happy] Every New Year's Eve we burn these little paper wishes and the smoke is supposed to—oh man, last year mine caught the curtains on fire! [Laugh] [Fast] Dad was so mad!
82  You're gonna think this is strange but, er, we bury a jar of pennies in the backyard every summer solstice? [Whisper] Nobody remembers why anymore. [Chuckle]
83  [Slow] The thing about our Sunday dinners is that whoever arrives last has to... [Disappointed] well, they become the designated storyteller for the entire meal. [Tsk]
84  [Sarcastic] Sure, let's all pretend that watching the same movie every Christmas Eve is "magical" and not just because Dad doesn't know how to work Netflix. [Groan]
85  Okay so basically when someone turns sixteen in our family they gotta—no wait, first they blindfold you, then—[Fast] actually it's easier if I just show you the video. [Laugh]
86  [Angry] I mean, why does it always have to be me who explains this to people?! [Sad] Everyone else just assumes outsiders automatically understand our weird pickle ceremony!
87  The birthday person isn't allowed to, um, touch their cake until everyone else takes a bite first—[Whisper] supposedly it brings good luck but I dunno. [Sigh]
88  [Happy] Oh, you're gonna love this part—we all wear our clothes inside out on the first day of spring! [Chuckle] The neighbors think we're absolutely insane!
89  [Slow] It's not really about the tradition itself, I guess, it's more about—[Disappointed] well, it's the only time everyone actually shows up anymore.
90  We've been doing this since before I was born and honestly? [Sarcastic] Nobody can agree on the actual rules so we just kinda make it up as we go. [Tsk] [Fast] Very official family tradition right there.
91  [Shout] No no no, you're holding it wrong! [Happy] Here, let me—sorry, I get weirdly intense about the proper way to pass the ceremonial spoon. [Laugh]
93  I know, I know I did, but—look, my mom literally called me crying. What was I supposed to do, just ignore that? I mean, come on, you know I wouldn't bail unless it was something serious.
94  I—okay, yeah, I should've texted sooner. But honestly, I was kinda dealing with a family emergency here? [Sigh] Like, I get that you're mad, but you're acting like I just decided to blow you off for fun.
95  That's not—that's not fair though. You know me better than that. I've never, and I mean never, broken a promise to you before this, so maybe—I dunno—maybe cut me some slack here?
96  Oh, so this is about you being embarrassed? Not about—okay, fine. [Frustrated laugh] I'm sorry everyone asked questions, but my mom was having a literal breakdown, so excuse me for prioritizing that.
97  I'm not! I'm just—look look, I'm trying to explain that sometimes things happen that are outta my control, y'know? And yeah, I shoulda handled it better, but you're not even letting me explain properly.
98  Because my mom needed me! God, you're being so—whatever. Fine. I messed up. Is that what you wanna hear? But I'm not gonna apologize for putting my family first when there was an actual crisis.
99  And I get that, I really do. But like—life happens sometimes? I didn't plan for this. I wanted to be there, honestly I did, but I literally couldn't. [Scoff] And you standing there all cold and angry isn't exactly helping anything.
100  Yeah, and promises are important, but they're not—they're not more important than emergencies. I mean, if your dad had a heart attack, would you still show up to my thing? Seriously?
101  How? How is it different? My mom was—she was falling apart, okay? And maybe I didn't handle the communication perfectly, but I was kinda busy trying to keep my family together, so...
102  That's it? Just "fine"? Look, I'm—I'm sorry I let you down, okay? I am. But I'm also really disappointed that you can't see past your own hurt here to understand that I was in an impossible situation.
103  Wait wait wait—you went up? You actually did it? Oh my god, I'm like—I'm literally so proud of you right now! How did it go?
104  They—hold on, they laughed? Like actually laughed? Not just polite chuckles but like, real laughs? [Gasp] Dude, that's incredible!
105  Stop it—the one where she, um, where she thinks salt is a vegetable? That's—oh my god, I knew that would kill! You were so nervous about that one!
106  Mid-set applause? That's like—okay that's basically unheard of for open mics. Were there any, y'know, any comics there? Like established ones?
107  No no no, you're—you're kidding me. The actual headliner watched your set? That's huge! What did they—did they say anything after? [Excited] Please tell me they said something!
108  Natural timing is like—that's literally the thing you can't teach! Oh my god, I'm getting secondhand adrenaline just hearing this. Are you gonna do it again?
109  Already—wait, you already booked another one? Look at you! [Laugh] Remember when you were like "I'll probably bomb and never do this again"?
110  No but seriously, this is—I mean, you've been writing jokes in that notebook for what, like two years? And you finally got up there and just... killed it.
111  It felt good? Okay okay, that's—that's the most emotion I've heard from you in months! You're gonna be one of those comics, aren't you? The ones who like, can't stop once they start?
112  We'll see, they say, like they're not already planning their [Chuckle] Netflix special. I'm so—honestly? I'm just really happy for you. This is your thing, I can feel it.
113  Comments? What—oh. Oh no. Is this about earlier? Because I didn't mean—I was just trying to be helpful, you know? Like supportive or whatever.
114  Okay, that came out wrong. Really wrong. I just meant like—when I said that thing about your jeans, I wasn't trying to [nervous laugh] god, this sounds terrible now that I'm saying it out loud.
115  Wait wait wait, there's more? Oh god, what else did I—actually, no, you're right. I know I've been... I've been doing this a lot lately, haven't I? The gym comment last week and the—the salad thing.
116  Shit. Shit, I'm—I'm that person. I'm literally that person who can't shut up about—god, I'm so sorry. My mom does this to me and I hate it and now I'm doing it to you [groan] I'm the worst.
117  I deserve that. I do. It's just—okay this isn't an excuse but my sister just started this whole fitness thing and she keeps talking about it and I guess I just internalized all that toxic—that's not your problem though. That's my problem.
118  No no no, of course not. That's not—I wasn't gonna—look, I genuinely didn't realize how much I was doing it until right now. Like hearing you list it all out? I wanna crawl into a hole and die.
119  That's not—oh my god, of course you do. Of course. I'm not trying to—I don't think you need to change or anything. Honestly, I think I was projecting my own weird issues and that's so unfair to you.
120  I know. Or—actually I don't know, but I can imagine and I'm... I'm really, really sorry. Like genuinely sorry, not just saying-it-to-make-this-stop sorry. I had no idea I was hurting you like that. [quieter] I should've known though.
121  Oh. That's—wow. Okay. That really... yeah. I get it though. I do. Can we—is there a way to fix this? Because I swear I will never, ever comment on your body or your food or anything like that again. Ever.
122  I do mean it. I promise I do. And if I slip up—which I won't, but if I do—you can call me out immediately. Like, just tell me to shut up. I want you to. Because your friendship means way more to me than whatever stupid thing I might wanna say about... anything.
124  [devastated] My life is completely over! [voice breaking] The coffee shop ran out of oat milk, and I had to use regular milk in my latte. [wailing] How am I supposed to function today with dairy destroying my entire digestive system?
125  [dramatically gasping] That was different! [whimpering] Pizza cheese doesn't count because it's... it's comfort food! [building hysteria] But coffee is sacred, and now my whole morning routine is ruined forever and I'll probably die!
126  [trembling whisper] You don't understand the psychological damage! [getting louder] I specifically chose that coffee shop because they respect dietary preferences! [shouting] This betrayal cuts deeper than when Jennifer stole my parking spot last Tuesday!
127  [defensive shriek] Details! [quieter, sulking] The point is that everything is against me today. [building drama again] First the milk catastrophe, then I broke a nail, and now you're being completely heartless about my suffering!
128  [sobbing dramatically] See? [hiccupping] This is exactly why I can't share my feelings with you! [accusatory] When YOUR favorite pen ran out of ink, I was there for you! I listened! I cared!
129  [wounded gasp] How can you put a price on emotional trauma? [pleading] My grandmother gave me these nails! [softer, manipulative] Well, she gave me the DNA that grows them, which is basically the same thing!
130  [indignant squeal] They're gel, not acrylic! [huffing] And it was twenty dollars! [dejected moan] But fine, minimize my pain. When I'm hospitalized for calcium deficiency from avoiding dairy forever, don't come visit me!
131  [mysteriously] You know what? [building suspense] I might be! [dramatic revelation] Maybe I'm developing multiple food sensitivities because of the stress you're causing me right now with your complete lack of empathy!
132  [fake cheerful] Fine! [bitterly] I'll just suffer alone! [melodramatic whisper] Like I always do, carrying the weight of this cruel, dairy-filled world on my lactose-intolerant shoulders while everyone else lives in ignorant bliss!
133  [immediately sympathetic] Oh my god, your rent went up? [excited squeal] Why didn't you say something? [rapidly] We should totally move in together and split the cost! Think of all the money we'd save!
134  [mysteriously] I need to understand your... membership structures. [pause] The basic tier at $60 annually versus the, um, Executive at $120—[whispers] what hidden benefits exist beyond the posted signage?
135  [contemplatively] Two percent... interesting. [suddenly intense] If someone were to spend, say, $6,000 annually on—[clears throat] let's call them "bulk provisions"—the mathematics become quite favorable, don't they?
136  [cryptically] Tires, yes... vehicles need those. [more directly] Tell me about the pharmacy benefits under policy PH-2024-EX. [quietly] Are prescription records kept... separately from main membership databases?
137  [satisfied] Precisely what I meant. [abruptly] Business memberships—code BUS-500X—can those be registered to, shall we say, [pause] entities with offshore addresses like Box 4472, Grand Cayman?
138  [intrigued] Sixteen additional humans, fascinating redundancy. [calculating] If hypothetically someone needed to purchase 500 pounds of—[coughs]—protein powder monthly, would that trigger any... [whispers darkly] algorithmic concerns in your inventory system INV-TRACK-7?
139  [thoughtfully] Loading dock 7-B... noted for future reference. [urgently] One final query—member data from terminated accounts, policy TERM-POL-2024, [lower voice] how long before complete purging from servers located at 1599 Data Center Drive?
140  [pleased] Cash transactions, the elegant simplicity of analog commerce. [decisively] I'll take the Executive membership, paying in sequential hundreds. [mysteriously soft] Please register it under the name "A. Individual"—[chuckles] first initial A, period, last name Individual.
141  [smoothly] Excellent, here's a passport from—[pause] never mind which nation. [quickly] Send everything to P.O. Box 1138, Station Alpha, zip code 00501. [satisfied sigh] This concludes our illuminating exchange about membership benefits, doesn't it?
142  [amused] Roadside assistance for protein transport emergencies, how... thoughtful. [formally] You've been most informative, employee badge number—[squints] —4472. [whispers] I may return during your shift pattern, Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10am to 6pm.
143  [cryptically] Hot dogs... processed meat of mysterious origin, yes. [standing to leave] Until we meet again—[pause] though you won't remember this conversation. [softer] Check your pocket later for a tip that's distinctly... non-digital.
144  Good afternoon, Pest Shield Services, this is Marcus speaking. How can I help you today? I see you're calling from—oh yes, the Johnson residence on Maple Street.
145  [apologetically] Oh no, I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Mrs. Johnson. Our treatment comes with a thirty-day guarantee, so we'll absolutely send someone back. Let me just pull up your file here... when works best for you?
146  I completely understand the urgency. [more quickly] Let me check our schedule—we have... actually, Tom can squeeze you in between three and five today. He's our senior technician, specializes in persistent ant colonies.
147  [thoughtfully] Sometimes ants switch their food preferences seasonally—protein versus sugar. Tom will bring our full arsenal this time, different gel baits, granules, the works. [reassuringly] We'll identify the species and hit them with exactly what they're craving.
148  [quickly] Absolutely no additional charges, it's all covered under your initial service warranty. Tom will also do a full perimeter check—sometimes we find new entry points that weren't visible before. Would you like him to call when he's on his way?
149  Oh, that's so frustrating, losing food on top of everything else. I'm making detailed notes for Tom right now—kitchen priority, check pantry area thoroughly. He'll also leave extra bait stations in problem zones, no charge.
150  Absolutely, and that's exactly why we're sending Tom. He's been with us twelve years, has this methodical approach—checks everything from foundation cracks to, [chuckles] even dishwasher connections. Really thorough guy.
151  Just clear under the sink if you can, give Tom access to baseboards. Don't worry about deep cleaning—actually, leaving a few ants visible helps him track their trails. Oh, and pet bowls should be picked up during treatment.
152  I'm really sorry you were given that impression. Sometimes it does take one visit, but persistent colonies, especially in spring—they can be tricky. I'm also adding a note for Tom to inspect neighboring units for source colonies.
153  [reassuringly] He definitely will, and if it is from neighboring property, we can coordinate treatment. I've scheduled you for three to five, Tom Rodriguez will call thirty minutes before arrival. Is this still the best number to reach you?
154  [Fast] Okay so, like, I was in my childhood home but it wasn't—it had extra rooms that kept appearing, you know? [Confused] [Laugh]
155  [Whisper] And my teeth started falling out, one by one, into my hands like, um, like little pearls or something. [Slow] [Tsk]
156  [Happy] The weirdest part? I could fly but only, uh, only backwards! [Chuckle] Just zooming through clouds in reverse!
157  [Sarcastic] Oh, and naturally my boss was there dressed as a giant lobster, because that's totally normal, right? [Groan]
158  [Slow] Everything was kinda... underwater but I could still breathe somehow? [Sigh] I dunno, it felt completely natural at the time.
159  [Angry] I kept trying to scream but—but nothing would come out! [Fast] Just this horrible silence while everyone stared at me!
160  [Disappointed] My phone wouldn't work properly, like, the numbers kept changing and I couldn't—I just couldn't call anyone for help. [Tsk] [Sad]
161  You were there too, but you had, um, your face was all wrong somehow? [Slow] [Whisper]
162  [Shout] Then suddenly I'm at my wedding but I'm wearing pajamas! [Laugh] [Fast] Everyone's just acting like it's totally fine!
163  [Sad] My grandma showed up, which was—I mean, she passed away years ago, but there she was, y'know? [Sigh] [Slow]
164  [Happy] I won the lottery but the money was all, like, Monopoly money and I didn't even care! [Chuckle] Just stuffing it in my pockets!
165  [Fast] Wait wait wait, I forgot the part where my cat could talk—actually, all animals could talk and they were really judgmental! [Groan]
166  [Disappointed] I kept trying to run but my legs were like—ugh, like moving through molasses or something. [Angry] So frustrating!
167  [Whisper] There was this door that I knew I shouldn't open, but I had to—I just had to see what was behind it. [Tsk] [Slow]
168  [Sarcastic] And of course I showed up to take an exam I'd never studied for, because my subconscious is super original like that. [Sigh]
169  Honestly, the sky was, um, purple with green stars and nobody seemed to—to even notice anything was off? [Slow] [Disappointed]
170  [Shout] I turned into a bird mid-conversation! [Laugh] [Happy] Just literally sprouted wings and took off while talking to my mother!
171  [Sad] I was lost in this endless hallway and every door led to—to the same empty room over and over. [Whisper] [Sigh]
172  [Fast] My reflection didn't match what I was doing, like it had its own—its own agenda or whatever, super creepy! [Angry] [Tsk]
173  [Chuckle] The whole thing ended when I realized I was dreaming, and then I tried to—to stay asleep but couldn't! [Disappointed] Typical, right?
175  I know, I know how long you were—look, I wanted to come, okay? I did. But hospitals are just... [exhale] they're really hard for me. Like, really hard.
176  Don't—don't do that. Don't just say "right" like that. You know about my anxiety, I've told you about the whole thing with my mom and—I mean, I literally can't even drive past one without feeling like I'm gonna throw up.
177  That's not—okay okay, that's not fair. Everyone else doesn't have panic attacks in medical settings. I texted you every day, I sent food, I called—I was trying to be there in the ways I could, y'know?
178  No, it's not the same, you're right. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I just... forgot about you or something. [scoff] Like I was just hanging out, having a great time while you were there.
179  Are you serious right now? I was—I was literally worried sick about you the entire time. I couldn't sleep, I was checking my phone constantly for updates, I was—honestly, this is really unfair.
180  And I needed to not have a complete breakdown in your hospital room! That's—that would've made everything worse, wouldn't it? Me hyperventilating while you're trying to recover?
181  I did try! I got—I got all the way to the parking garage twice. Twice. And both times I just... I couldn't. [frustrated laugh] But sure, yeah, I guess that doesn't count as trying.
182  Wow. Okay. So basically nothing I did matters because I couldn't physically be in that room. The daily check-ins, the—the care packages, asking your sister for updates every few hours, none of that counts.
183  Oh, come on, don't—don't do the past tense thing. Look look, I'm sorry I couldn't be there the way you wanted. I am. But I was drowning in my own stuff and trying—trying really hard to support you anyway.
184  That's... [sigh] okay, I get that you're hurt. I do. And maybe—maybe I should've pushed through it somehow, I dunno. But I'm also disappointed that after everything, you can't see that I was doing my best. Even if my best wasn't enough.
185  Wait wait wait—what went through? Are you talking about the—oh my god, the patent? Did you actually get the patent?!
186  Are you—holy shit, are you serious right now? That's like... that's literally life-changing! I mean, you've been working on this for what, three years? [Gasp] Oh my god, we gotta celebrate!
187  Three and a—okay but like, do you realize how huge this is? You're gonna be like, an actual inventor now. Like officially. With paperwork and everything!
188  Weird? Babe, no no no, this is—I mean, okay yeah, I get it must be kinda surreal but like... you did this. You actually pulled it off, y'know?
189  Oh man, they're gonna—wait, are you nervous about telling them? Because honestly, after all that crap they said about you wasting time in the garage? [Chuckle] This is gonna be so good.
190  Okay but—but it could be, right? Like, now that it's patented you can actually, I dunno, sell it or license it or whatever inventors do?
191  There's—hold up, there's already interest? And you're just casually mentioning this now like it's nothing? [Laugh] You're literally the worst at sharing good news, you know that?
192  No no, I totally get that, but like—can you at least tell me which companies? Are we talking big ones or like, startups or what?
193  The—oh my god, you mean like, the fancy ones everyone has? That's... okay that's actually insane. How are you being so calm about this right now?
194  Yeah, no, I can—I can actually see your hand shaking a little bit. [Softer] Hey, this is gonna change everything for you, huh? Like, in the best way possible.
195  Oh god—okay, I was gonna tell you, I swear I was gonna tell you. It just—it happened so fast and I didn't know how to bring it up, y'know?
196  Um, like two weeks? Maybe three? But wait wait wait—before you get mad, we didn't plan it or anything. We just ran into each other at that party and—actually no, that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] Let me start over.
197  No no no, not lying! I just—I hadn't found the right time to tell you. Which I realize now was stupid because there's literally never gonna be a right time for "hey I'm hooking up with your ex," right?
198  I did. I mean, of course I did, that's why I—god, I'm such an idiot. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal because you guys have been broken up for like six months, but that's not—that doesn't make it okay. [sigh] I know that.
199  You're right, you're totally right. And honestly? I wasn't even thinking about—okay that's a lie, I was definitely thinking about how you'd react. I just kinda... convinced myself you wouldn't care as much as you obviously do.
200  I don't—I dunno, it just happened? We were both drunk and talking about work stuff and then suddenly we were—um. Yeah. But then we kept texting and it turned into this whole thing that I never expected.
201  What? No! God no, I would never—this was never about you. I mean, obviously it affects you, but I didn't do this to hurt you. I actually really do like them. Like, a lot. Which makes this so much worse because I want to be happy but I also just completely betrayed my best friend and I—[groan] I'm handling this so badly.
202  I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I should've—the second I realized there was something between us, I should've come to you. That would've been the right thing to do, y'know? Instead of being a coward about it.
203  Yeah, no, totally. Take all the time you need. I just—can we eventually talk about this? Like actually talk? Because I can't lose you over this. You're literally one of the most important people in my life and if I have to choose—
204  Okay. Yeah, okay. I'll—I'll wait. And again, I'm so sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything but... I really am sorry.
205  That's not—okay, that's not what happened. I wasn't pretending not to know you, I just... I didn't know how to introduce you to my boss and everyone. It was awkward.
206  Look look, I know how it seemed, but you literally showed up out of nowhere and I was in the middle of this whole—they were talking about promotions. [frustrated laugh] I panicked, okay?
207  I didn't walk past—I mean, I kinda did, but I was gonna circle back. You're acting like I planned this whole thing to humiliate you or something.
208  Come on, that's—you know that's not fair. These people, they're... they're different, okay? They judge everything. Who you know, where you hang out, literally everything matters with them. I'm not saying I handled it right, but [sigh] you don't get what it's like.
209  No! God, no, that's not what I'm—why are you twisting this? You're not embarrassing, the situation was just... complicated. I didn't wanna explain our whole history to them right there.
210  Yeah, and those ten years mean something to me too, obviously. But you're not—look, you're not being fair either. You show up at my work thing wearing that shirt with all the holes and—okay okay, that came out wrong.
211  That's not what I meant and you know it. I just—these work people, they're judgmental assholes, honestly. And I'm trying to get promoted, and I didn't know how to... [groan] merge those two worlds right then.
212  You're right. You're right, I should've—I dunno, done something. But I froze, okay? And now you're acting like I'm this terrible person when really I just... I messed up. Can't we just—
213  Move past this? I mean, seriously, one awkward moment and you're ready to throw away everything? That's kinda harsh, don't you think?
214  And I'm sorry about—no, actually? I'm sorry-ish. Because yeah, I handled it badly, but you could also try to understand that my job is... it's complicated. And maybe—maybe you coulda just let it go instead of making this whole thing into some huge betrayal.
215  I know, I know, I'm—look, I tried to make it work, okay? I really did. But then Jamie needed help moving and I'd already promised weeks ago, and I thought I could do both but—
216  That's not—okay, that's kinda true, but it's not like I'm trying to let you down. I just... I dunno, people need things and I wanna help. Is that really so terrible?
217  Come on, that's—you're being dramatic. It's not always you. [Sigh] And honestly? Sometimes it feels like you expect me to drop everything for you when I've got like, a million other commitments I made first.
218  Oh, okay, so I should just—what, tell everyone no? That's your solution? Look look, I get that you're mad, but you don't understand how hard it is when people are literally counting on me.
219  And I'm sorry about that, I am, but—[frustrated laugh]—you're acting like I do this to hurt you on purpose. Like I wake up thinking "how can I disappoint my friend today?" That's not what happens.
220  That's—wow. That's really unfair. I don't forget you exist, I just... sometimes I overestimate what I can handle, okay? And yeah yeah, maybe I should say no more, but it's not that simple.
221  No, it's not! You don't—ugh, you don't get it. When someone's like, desperate for help, I can't just be like "sorry, no." That's not who I am. And honestly? I thought you'd understand that about me by now.
222  Strangers? Seriously? Jamie's not a stranger, they're—whatever. You know what? I'm trying to explain myself here and you're just... you're not even listening. You've already decided I'm the worst friend ever.
223  I'm—[scoff] how am I supposed to prove anything when you're like this? I messed up, fine, but I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I'm some terrible person because I tried to help too many people at once.
224  That's not what I—you know what? Fine. Be mad. But maybe, just maybe, consider that I'm drowning here too, trying to keep everyone happy, and yeah, I failed today. But at least I'm trying.
225  Wait wait wait—what? You graduated? Like, officially done done? Oh my god, why didn't you—I mean, this is huge! Years of night school and you're just casually mentioning it now?
226  I'm literally—okay, I'm getting emotional here because like, do you even realize how insane this is? Working full-time and then dragging yourself to class until what, ten at night? [Laugh] You're basically superhuman.
227  Oh no no no, don't do that. Don't minimize this. You passed—that's what matters. God, remember when you were like, studying in your car during lunch breaks? That was—I mean, I honestly don't know how you didn't lose it.
228  That professor, right? The one who—ugh, what was his name? Actually, y'know what, doesn't matter. He's in your rearview now. [Sigh] How does it feel though? Like, really?
229  Oh that's so—okay that's weirdly sad but also kinda funny? Like your brain hasn't caught up yet. What're you gonna do with all your Tuesday nights now?
230  TV! Actual leisure time! Revolutionary concept, honestly. But like—okay, real talk, are you proud of yourself? Because you should be. You really, really should be.
231  A month, okay okay, I'll—I'll give you that. But um, we're celebrating, right? Like, this isn't negotiable. I'm thinking dinner, drinks, the whole thing.
232  [Gasp] Stop it—that's adorable! She's probably been waiting for this longer than you have. Let her have her moment, y'know? She watched you struggle through all of it.
233  Small, got it. But I'm definitely making a speech. Don't even—don't look at me like that, I'm gonna cry and everything. It'll be embarrassing for both of us, it's gonna be great.
234  Too late, already writing it in my head. Something about perseverance and—oh! Remember that time you literally fell asleep standing up at my birthday? [Chuckle] Yeah, that's going in there for sure.
236  [breathlessly] Oh my God, is that what I think it is?! [voice rising] Let me see your hand—no, wait, is this real? [Squeals] This is actually happening right now, and I can't believe you didn't tell me immediately!
237  [shouting] The botanical gardens! [voice cracking] That's so perfect I could cry—actually, I am crying! [Gasps] Look at the size of that diamond! How did you keep this secret for an entire night without exploding?
238  [shakily] We have to plan everything! [speaking rapidly] The dress, the venue, the flowers—oh my God, I'm going to be your maid of honor, right? [pleading tone] Please say yes or I'll literally die on this kitchen floor.
239  [dreamily] Remember our wedding binders? [Laughs] They're still in Mom's attic with all those magazine clippings. [more excitedly] We thought we'd marry princes who'd arrive on white horses, not Dave from accounting with his Toyota!
240  [quietly awed] I'm so happy for you. [voice swelling] You deserve every single beautiful moment of this. [Shaky breath] When you walk down that aisle, I promise I'll try not to sob louder than the music plays.
241  [trembling] Is that—is that really you? [voice breaking] I thought everyone was gone, I thought I was the only one left! [Sobbing gasp] Please tell me this isn't another hallucination from the radiation.
242  [quivering] Your face, you're so thin. [more urgently] How long since you've eaten? [Shaky breath] I have some canned peaches in my pack, they're from before everything went dark.
243  [fierce whisper] Don't talk like that. [stronger] We're alive, we found each other against impossible odds! [Gasping cry] That has to mean something, that has to mean we're supposed to survive this nightmare.
244  [frantically] We need to move north before the second wave hits. [steadier] There's a group gathering supplies near the old hospital. [soft sob] They have medicine, clean water—things we only dreamed about finding.
245  [pleading] Because I've already been there, they took in children! [voice rising] Children who lost everything, just like us. [Whimpering] Please, just trust me one more time, like you used to before the world ended.
246  [nostalgic whisper] Remember that camping trip where we got lost for six hours? [laughing through tears] You said we'd never survive the wilderness. [Snorting] Look at us now, actual apocalypse survivors finding each other.
247  [determined] Hey, no more hell talk, okay? [gentler] We're going to make it through this because we have each other now. [Shaky inhale] Two people means shared watch duties, shared hope, shared tomorrow.
248  [urgent whisper] Wait, do you hear that? [more anxiously] There's movement in the building behind you—we should go now. [Panicked breath] Grab my hand and don't let go no matter what happens next.
249  [commanding] It's just debris falling, breathe! [soothing] The infected don't come out until dusk, we have time. [Relieved sigh] See? Just the wind knocking things over, like it always does now.
250  [tender] Those speeches kept me going too, even when I was alone. [firm resolve] We're writing a new one together now. [Tearful smile in voice] Chapter one: two friends refuse to let the world end.
251  [nervously] Hi, um, I'm calling about setting up a wallet? [clears throat] I've been trying to, to figure this out for like three hours now, and [frustrated sigh] nothing makes sense on your website.
252  [shuffling] Oh, yeah, it's K7-4923-881. [pause] Wait, no, sorry—[embarrassed] that's 882 at the end, not 881.
253  [confused] I don't—what's the difference? [increasingly worried] Someone on Reddit said I need a seed phrase with like 24 words? [exhales sharply] Is that the cold one?
254  [overwhelmed] Okay, okay, so if I want to move my, um, 0.043 Bitcoin—[hesitant] is that even enough to worry about? [self-deprecating chuckle] I bought it at $47,000, so...
255  [frantically] Let me check—yeah, it's 839-264. [suspicious] Wait, this is legitimate right? [nervous laugh] You're not one of those scammers?
256  [relieved] Oh good, good. [muttering] Let me write this down... bc1q... [confused again] How many characters is this thing supposed to be?
257  [frustrated groan] This is so complicated! [pleading] Can't you just, I don't know, send it to my email at jchen.crypto@gmail—[catches himself] wait, that's probably not secure, is it?
258  [sighs deeply] Alright, so after I get this bc1q address thing, [tentatively] I can finally move my coins off your exchange? [hopefully] And they'll be safe in my own wallet?
259  [shocked] Wait, that's like—[calculating] six dollars just to move it? [disappointed] Man, I remember when fees were like fifty cents back in 2017.
260  [resigned] Fine, I'll try Sunday then. [muttering] My wife's gonna kill me when she finds out I'm waking up at 3 AM for crypto. [nervous chuckle] Thanks for your help though, really.
261  I completely understand your frustration with this situation. [speaking quickly] Let me pull up your account right away and see what's causing the delay. [reassuring] Can you provide me your student ID number?
262  Okay, I see here that your FAFSA was received but there's a verification hold. [more quickly] Did you submit your tax documents and the, um, the verification worksheet we sent on January 15th?
263  [calmly] No, no, you won't lose your classes. We can do an emergency deferment today to protect your enrollment while we sort this out. The worksheet was sent to your school email—do you check that regularly?
264  I understand the confusion, and you're right, it's not ideal. Let me just—okay, I'm sending that worksheet to your personal email right now. Can you fill it out and upload it today?
265  Unfortunately, federal regulations require this verification for about thirty percent of students. But here's what I can do—I'll extend the deferment deadline to Friday, giving you time to gather everything. Would that help?
266  Once we receive your documents, processing typically takes 3-5 business days. So if you submit Friday, you're looking at the following Wednesday or Thursday. [helpfully] We can also set up a payment plan for any immediate needs.
267  [confidently] Once you're verified this time, you're good for the entire academic year. [speaking rapidly] I'm also putting a note in your file to flag you for priority processing next year. [brightly] That should prevent future delays.
268  No, it's definitely real—it puts you in a faster queue. Look, I know we've dropped the ball here, and I'm genuinely sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help with today?
269  [reassuringly] The deferment is already applied—you should see it in your portal within the hour. I've also sent you my direct extension, so call me personally if there are any issues. [warmly] We'll get this sorted out.
270  No apology needed—I'd be frustrated too. [quickly] Just remember to check that school email going forward, and get those documents in by Friday. You're all set for now, and good luck with your classes tomorrow!
271  [Disappointed] I mean, honestly, why am I always the one who has to, like, remember where we parked? [Sigh] It's exhausting.
272  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just—let me handle everything while you guys have fun. [Tsk] That's totally fair, right?
273  [Fast] Okay so we gotta leave in ten minutes, everybody needs their IDs, and I already called the Uber—wait, where's Marcus? [Groan]
274  [Happy] You know what? I actually kinda like being the mom friend sometimes. [Laugh] Someone's gotta keep you idiots alive!
275  [Whisper] They're all passed out and I'm just sitting here making sure nobody, um, chokes on their own vomit or whatever. [Slow] This is my Friday night.
276  [Angry] I'm not your personal assistant, okay? [Shout] Figure out your own damn ride home for once!
277  [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna be the messy one, y'know? Like, just once let me be the disaster. [Sigh]
278  [Slow] Every single time we go out, it's me who ends up—actually, forget it. [Disappointed] [Tsk] You wouldn't understand anyway.
279  [Fast] [Happy] Wait wait wait, I brought extra phone chargers for everyone! [Chuckle] See? This is why you need me!
280  [Sarcastic] Nobody ever asks if I wanna do shots, but everyone suddenly knows my name when they need a designated driver. [Disappointed] Funny how that works, huh?
281  [Angry] I literally sent fifteen reminders about this deadline and you're just now—are you seriously just now starting? [Groan] Unbelievable.
282  [Whisper] [Sad] I'm so tired of being the only adult in the room, but I can't just... I can't stop, can I?
283  [Chuckle] You guys would basically die without me and we all know it. [Happy] [Fast] Remember last week when nobody brought water to the hike?
284  [Slow] [Disappointed] I guess I'll just, um, cancel my plans again to deal with your emergency. [Sigh] Third time this month.
285  [Shout] How do none of you have the venue address? [Angry] [Fast] The event is literally starting and I'm the only one who knows where we're going!
286  [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh no, please, don't worry about paying me back for those tickets I bought six months ago. [Tsk] I love being everyone's personal bank.
287  [Happy] Actually, being the responsible one means I get to pick the restaurant every time 'cause nobody else makes reservations! [Laugh] [Fast] Silver lining, right?
288  [Sad] Do you guys even notice when I'm not—when I don't show up? [Whisper] Or am I just, like, the human calendar app to you?
289  [Disappointed] I'm twenty-three years old and I'm literally making grocery lists for grown adults who can't feed themselves. [Groan] [Slow] This isn't what I signed up for.
290  [Fast] [Angry] Nobody brought sunscreen, nobody checked the weather, and somehow—somehow I'm the buzzkill for pointing this out? [Sarcastic] Yeah, okay, that makes total sense!
292  Okay I deserve that. I totally deserve that. But like, honestly? I'm gonna make this up to you. Whatever you need—unpacking, organizing, I'll buy you pizza for a month, I don't care. Just... please don't hate me forever?
293  You sure? Because you seem pretty—I mean, you have every right to be pissed. I would be too if someone flaked on me like that.
294  Can I—would it be okay if I came over now? I could bring dinner and help you unpack? Or just... sit there while you yell at me some more. Whatever you need, honestly. [sigh] I just really wanna fix this.
295  No, but I've got that heating pad you like? And um, those muscle relaxer things from when I threw out my shoulder? Plus I make a mean massage—wait, that's weird. I meant like, I could help with the heavy boxes that are left or whatever.
296  Yeah! The fancy one with like, all the settings and stuff. And I'll grab takeout from that Thai place you love—the one with the crazy spicy pad thai that basically destroys my mouth but you somehow eat like it's nothing?
297  Obviously! Oh thank god, yes, absolutely I'm paying. And next time you move—which hopefully isn't for like, a really long time—I'm gonna be there super early with coffee and donuts and like, an actual truck. I promise. No more flaking.
298  Oh god. Oh no no no. I was gonna—I wanted to tell you in person, I swear. This isn't how you were supposed to find out.
299  I know how it looks but it wasn't—we didn't really invite anyone? It was super small, like literally just family and—okay that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] I'm making this worse.
300  I know! God, I know, and that's why this is so—I mean, you gotta understand, Marcus's parents basically hijacked the whole thing? They wanted this tiny ceremony and we just... we went along with it.
301  No wait wait, please don't do the one-word thing. I can't—I need you to know that I wanted you there. Like, desperately wanted you there. I actually argued about it for weeks. [sigh]
302  That's... yeah. That's fair. I should've fought harder, I should've just—I dunno, insisted? But his mom was crying and talking about tradition and intimate family moments and I just... I caved. I'm weak, okay? I'm admitting it.
303  You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm literally the worst friend. I kept meaning to call but then it felt like the longer I waited the worse it got? And then suddenly it was happening and—that's not an excuse. There's no excuse.
304  I know. [groan] God, I know you would've and that makes it worse somehow? Like you're—you're literally being more understanding right now than I deserve and I just... I panicked. I always panic with confrontation, you know that about me.
305  I'm so sorry. Like, from the bottom of my heart, I'm so—we're actually planning a bigger reception thing next month? For all our friends? And you're obviously—I mean, if you even wanna come now—you're the first person on that list.
306  I know it's not the same. It's not. But maybe we could—I dunno, maybe you could do a speech? Or—wait, that's probably insulting to even suggest. I just... I really wanna make this right somehow.
307  Yeah. Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. And I'm—I'm just really, really sorry. You deserved so much better from me. As a friend, I mean. You deserved better.
309  [Wild laughter] Their golden armor couldn't save them! [panting heavily] Did you see Marcus's face when my blade found its mark? [quieter] The crowd chants our names now, not theirs—we are legends born today!
310  [Hushed awe] Look at them flee the arena. [mocking tone] The "invincible" Praetorian Guard, running like children! [Bellowing laugh] My mother always said I'd amount to nothing—if only she could witness her son's glory now!
311  [Whispered excitement] The emperor's jaw clenched when you broke Titus's shield. [growing louder] His precious champion, trained since birth, defeated by arena dogs! [Cackling] We've shattered more than bones—we've broken the myth of their superiority forever!
312  [Trembling with emotion] Brother, we've survived the impossible. [more firmly] A hundred men have died where we stand victorious. [Sobbing laugh] The gods themselves must have guided our blades through that massacre of steel and fury!
313  [Fierce whisper] Tomorrow they'll offer us anything—gold, women, land beyond imagination. [normal volume] But tonight, we stand as brothers forged in combat's furnace. [Roaring] Nothing can break the bond of warriors who've tasted death together!
314  [Quick and excited] Did you hear the senators gasping when I took two at once? [slowing down] Their perfect world crumbled in moments. [Shrieking victory] We've proven that birth means nothing when steel meets flesh in honest combat!
315  [Shaking voice] I thought we'd die today, truly. [more confident] Instead, we've written ourselves into Rome's history with blood. [Hysterical laughter] The emperor's champions—defeated by two nameless gladiators who refused to kneel or break!
316  [Breathless wonder] The crowd threw flowers instead of stones. [steadying] Women weep for our victory, children chant our names in streets. [Triumphant cry] We've become what every gladiator dreams—heroes instead of corpses in sand!
317  [Reverent whisper] The gods watched us today, I felt it. [normal tone] Mars himself guided my blade through their defenses. [Screaming] We were instruments of divine justice, punishing their hubris with our humble, savage strength!
318  [Final roar] Tonight we feast as free men! [quieter triumph] Tomorrow brings new battles, but nothing can steal this moment. [Whispered intensity] We are gladiators who conquered champions, and Rome herself trembles at what we've done!
319  Ms. Wilson, I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing increased discomfort. Let me pull up your file from Tuesday, November 14th... Can you describe specifically where the pain is radiating?
320  That sounds like potential sciatic nerve involvement, which is concerning. [more urgently] I need you to come in immediately—can you make it by 3:30 PM today? We'll do a complete reassessment, no charge, reference code NC-1147.
321  I understand your frustration completely, Ms. Wilson. However, sometimes the body needs 48 to 72 hours to adjust—though your symptoms do sound atypical. Let's focus on getting you relief first.
322  [professionally] Your insurance is active in our system, yes. [concerned tone] But Ms. Wilson, that's too much ibuprofen—please reduce to 600mg maximum. Can you rate your pain from 1 to 10 right now?
323  Ms. Wilson, with pain at that level, you need immediate attention. If you can't make it here, call 911 or go to Mercy General ER. I'll fax them your records, patient file JW-4782B-2023.
324  Thank you for reaching out to our office. I see you're inquiring about insurance coverage for therapy sessions. How can I help you today?
325  Yes, we do accept BlueCross BlueShield PPO plans. [briskly] Let me explain quickly—PPO means you have out-of-network benefits too, but in-network saves you money. Would you like me to verify your specific benefits?
326  [calmly] I completely understand, insurance can be confusing. For most PPO plans, you don't need pre-authorization for outpatient therapy. I'll just need your member ID and date of birth to check your benefits.
327  Let me pull that up for you right now. [briskly] While I'm checking—typically PPO plans have a deductible, then you pay a copay or coinsurance. Your out-of-pocket costs depend on whether you've met your deductible.
328  I see your deductible is $2,000, you're right. But here's good news—your plan covers 80% after deductible, and our session rate is $150. So you'd pay full price until deductible, then just $30 per session.
329  With $1,700 remaining on your deductible, roughly eleven sessions at full price. Many clients find the investment worth it, especially since therapy is ongoing. We also offer payment plans if that helps.
330  Absolutely, biweekly is perfectly fine to start. Dr. Martinez has openings Tuesday afternoons and Thursday mornings. [warmly] Would either of those work for your schedule?
331  Not a stupid question at all! We bill insurance directly, you just pay your portion at each visit. We'll handle all the claim submissions and paperwork for you.
332  We verify benefits before every session to avoid surprises. [quickly] If there's ever an issue, we contact you before providing service. You'll always know your costs upfront—no surprise bills, I promise.
333  I'm so glad we could help clarify everything. Tuesday at 2 PM or 4 PM? Dr. Martinez is wonderful, you're making a great decision for your health.
334  [Slow] I'm just gonna, um, rest my eyes for like two seconds here—no, no, I'm awake, totally listening. [Groan]
335  [Whisper] Did anyone else just see that? [Fast] I swear the clock went backwards, I'm not even kidding right now.
336  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, another pie chart about quarterly projections—this is, uh, this is exactly what my Tuesday needed. [Tsk]
337  [Happy] Coffee break! [Laugh] Finally, I can—wait, we're not done yet? Seriously?
338  [Angry] If he says "synergy" one more time, I'm gonna literally lose it, I mean, who even talks like that? [Groan]
339  [Sad] I used to be, like, excited about these meetings, y'know? [Sigh] Now I just kinda feel my soul leaving my body.
340  [Fast] Quick, someone ask a question so I can, um, so I can wake up a bit—I'm drifting here, people! [Chuckle]
341  [Disappointed] This could've been an email. [Slow] This really, really could've been a two-sentence email, couldn't it?
342  [Whisper] [Fast] Pinch me, pinch me right now before I start snoring—no wait, that's too obvious, just kick my chair.
343  [Shout] What? Oh, sorry, I was just—[Laugh]—enthusiastically agreeing with your point about, uh, the thing you just said!
344  [Slow] The fluorescent lights are literally humming a lullaby right now, and I'm, I'm fighting for my life here. [Sigh]
345  [Happy] Only forty-seven minutes left! [Sarcastic] I mean, who's counting, right?
346  [Angry] [Fast] My phone's dead, I've counted the ceiling tiles twice, and I swear time has actually stopped moving forward.
347  [Disappointed] I drove through rush hour traffic for this? [Tsk] [Slow] For a PowerPoint that hasn't changed since 2019?
348  [Whisper] Is it just me or does his voice sound exactly like, um, like white noise? [Chuckle] [Fast] I'm basically being hypnotized here.
349  [Sad] I had such big plans for today, y'know, and now I'm just—[Sigh]—now I'm watching my life tick away, slide by slide.
350  [Sarcastic] Sure, let's dive deeper into subsection 4B, because the first hour wasn't thorough enough, apparently. [Groan]
351  [Slow] [Whisper] If I just slowly slide down in my chair, maybe I can disappear under the—no, he's looking at me.
352  [Happy] [Fast] Wait, are those donuts? There are donuts! Suddenly I'm wide awake and very interested in this budget report!
353  [Angry] My leg's gone numb, my brain's gone numb, everything's just—[Tsk]—I gotta get outta here before I become part of the furniture.
355  I didn't—okay, I didn't lie exactly. I just... I mean, you were so excited about it and I didn't wanna be the one to, y'know, crush that. Is that really so terrible?
356  Come on, that's not—you're acting like I committed some huge crime here. I was trying to be supportive! You literally spent weeks on that thing and I thought—I dunno, I thought being encouraging was the right move.
357  And I get that, but honestly? Sometimes people say they want honesty when they really don't. [scoff] Like, you were practically glowing when you showed it to me—what was I supposed to say?
358  The truth. Right. Okay okay, so next time you're all proud of something, I should just—what, tear it apart? That's what you want from me? Because that feels pretty crappy too, just saying.
359  That's—no, that's not on me. I mean, I'm sorry you felt embarrassed, I really am, but you can't put that all on me. Other people saw it too, right? They could've said something.
360  Oh, come on, don't—don't do that. [frustrated laugh] I AM your friend, which is exactly why I didn't wanna hurt your feelings. You think I enjoyed pretending? It was awkward as hell for me too.
361  I knew it was... look look, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't—okay fine, yeah, it needed work. But you seemed so sure about it, and I figured, y'know, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it would land differently with other people.
362  I'm not making—ugh, seriously? I'm trying to explain where I was coming from here. And yeah, I messed up, I get that, but you're not exactly being fair either. You're acting like I did this to sabotage you or something.
363  That's... [sigh] okay, that's fair. I guess I did. But honestly? I thought I was protecting you. Which—yeah yeah, I know how that sounds now, but at the time it felt like the right thing.
364  No. It wasn't. And I'm—I'm sorry about that part, I really am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I was coming from a good place, even if I... even if I totally screwed it up.
365  Oh god, yeah, I—I know I got a little intense. Wait wait, no, that's not—I got way too intense, you're right. I'm sorry, I just get really into games sometimes and I know that's not an excuse.
366  What do you—oh. Oh no. Is this about the running thing too? Because I swear I didn't mean to make it weird when you said you ran a 5K, I was just excited that I'd done one too and—[nervous laugh]—okay yeah, I see how that came off.
367  I don't—wait, I made the cooking class competitive? How did I even—actually no, you know what, you're right. I remember. I literally turned making pasta into some kind of contest. God, I'm such an idiot.
368  I know. I know it is and I'm—I'm really sorry. It's just, growing up with three older siblings, everything was a competition, y'know? Like who could eat fastest, who got better grades, who could—[sigh] but that's not your problem. I shouldn't make it your problem.
369  No no no, please don't say that. That's—that's the last thing I want. I love when you share stuff with me, I really do. I think maybe I just get so excited that I wanna share too and then it becomes this whole—ugh, I'm doing it wrong.
370  Can we—can we maybe start over? Like, I promise I'll work on it. I'll literally bite my tongue if I have to. Actually, my therapist says I should try active listening more anyway, so maybe this is—sorry, not about me. This is about you. About us.
371  Yeah, I've been going for a couple months now. Not just for this! But it's kinda helped me realize that I do this thing where I need external validation constantly? And competing is like—it's basically my broken way of connecting with people. Which is messed up, I know.
372  I didn't wanna make a big deal about it. Plus I figured you'd tell me about your therapy and then I'd—oh my god, I would've made therapy competitive too, wouldn't I? [groan] I'm literally the worst.
373  Yeah, that's—that's fair. Really fair, actually. Um, would it help if we had like a code word or something? For when I'm doing it? So you can call me out? Because honestly, half the time I don't even realize I'm doing it until after.
374  Really? You'd—you'd do that? Oh thank god, I thought you were gonna stop being my friend entirely. I mean, I would've understood but I really really don't wanna lose you. You're like, one of the most important people in my life and I—yeah. I'll do better. Promise.
375  What? That's—that's not even—okay, where is this coming from? I apologize when I need to apologize. When I've actually done something wrong, y'know?
376  Well yeah, obviously. I'm not gonna apologize for stuff I didn't—look, if this is about yesterday, I already told you I didn't think it was that big a deal. [scoff] You're acting like I never take responsibility.
377  That's—come on, that's literally not true. Remember when I forgot your birthday dinner? I apologized like fifty times. Or when I accidentally told Jake about your promotion before you could? I owned that.
378  Okay okay, but—sometimes I genuinely don't realize something's wrong until you tell me. That doesn't mean I'm not sorry, it just means I'm not a [frustrated laugh] mind reader, y'know?
379  That's not what I—ugh, you're twisting my words. Look, I'm sorry if you feel like I don't apologize enough, but honestly? Sometimes you get upset about stuff that's just... I dunno, not actually my fault?
380  Um, literally last month? When you got mad that I went to Sarah's party without you? You said you didn't wanna go, so I went, and then suddenly I'm the bad guy for not convincing you harder or whatever.
381  That's—that's exactly what happened! You literally said "go without me" and I did, and then you were cold to me for like three days. [sigh] And I still said sorry, by the way, even though I didn't think I did anything wrong.
382  Because I was! I was sorry you felt bad, but I wasn't gonna pretend I did something terrible when I—when I literally just listened to what you told me to do.
383  No no no, don't—don't do that. Don't shut down just because I'm defending myself. You brought this up, and now you're mad that I'm not just... what, falling on my sword? Admitting I'm always wrong?
384  I'm—okay, fine. Maybe I could be better about that, I guess. But you gotta admit, sometimes you expect apologies for stuff that's just... life happening, y'know? Not everything needs to be somebody's fault.
386  [exhausted] So... that was the worst set of my entire life. [long pause] The silence after my airline food joke was so thick, [voice cracking] I could've carved it with a knife and served it as dessert.
387  [defensive] Come on, the crowd was dead from the start! [pleading] That guy in the front row was literally asleep before I even grabbed the mic. [quieter] Maybe my material just went over their heads?
388  [frantically] But I workshopped that one for weeks! [higher pitch] Sarah said it was hilarious when I practiced it at her place. [mumbling] Though she was pretty drunk at the time, now that I think about it.
389  [desperately cheerful] Okay but what about when I recovered with the impression? [voice dropping] The manager seemed to smile... [trailing off] or maybe that was a grimace, hard to tell in that lighting actually.
390  [defeated whisper] Should I just quit? [stronger] Five years of open mics and I'm still bombing like it's my first night. [Shaky breath] Even the bartender stopped pretending to laugh at this point.
391  [hopeful] You really think there's still hope? [nervously fast] Because I've got this new bit about dating apps that I've been working on and— [stopping short] wait, you're making that face again.
392  [frustrated growl] But unique doesn't pay bills! [sarcastically] Should I talk about my thrilling life as a part-time barista who lives with three roommates? [deflating] Because that's my unique perspective right there.
393  [skeptical] You want me to go up there and just... [slowly] talk about my actual pathetic life? [Nervous giggle] "Hey everyone, today my roommate used my coffee mug as an ashtray, how's your Tuesday?"
394  [considering] I did have that thing happen with the landlord and the raccoons last week. [building excitement] And my roommate's girlfriend who keeps stealing our toilet paper. [brightening] Maybe you're onto something here.
395  [renewed energy] Alright, new plan then! [determined] I'm ditching all the airplane food garbage and going full millennial-crisis mode. [laughing] If I'm going down, at least it'll be as myself.
396  Thank you for calling about policy PET-447892X! I completely understand the confusion—pre-existing conditions can be tricky. [reassuring tone] Basically, any diagnosed condition before your coverage start date of March 15th, 2024, would be considered pre-existing.
397  That's actually a great point about veterinary language. We'd need to review the complete medical records from Dr. Morrison's office. [helpful tone] Even informal observations can sometimes be classified as pre-existing, but nervous behavior alone might not exclude coverage.
398  I can see why you're concerned about the investment you've made. Let me pull up your claim history under account WH-3847-ANXC. Since you've been continuously covered, we might have options through our behavioral wellness add-on.
399  Actually, the behavioral add-on is only $12.50 monthly, effective immediately. And here's something interesting—since there's a gap between 2019 and 2024 with no treatment, we might consider this a new episode rather than continuation.
400  Our underwriting department at extension 5521 would make the final determination. [more confidently] But yes, gaps over 24 months often qualify for reconsideration. I can expedite your case to senior reviewer Ms. Chen, reference number SR-9984-FELX, for review within 48 hours.
401  Good afternoon, Riverside Auto, service department speaking. [quickly] How can I help you today—do you have an appointment or, uh, a question about your vehicle?
402  Oh, I see, let me just... pull up your information here. [more quickly] What's your VIN number or—actually, your name and the vehicle year would work too, whatever's easier.
403  Okay, Ms. Davidson, I'm seeing your file here. The recall is precautionary, but we do recommend scheduling service within, um, thirty days. You're safe to drive, just avoid any aggressive steering maneuvers.
404  No, no, normal driving is completely fine, I meant like—racing or extremely sharp turns at high speeds. [more calmly] Let me check our earliest availability for the repair, which takes about two hours.
405  I understand your frustration, truly. For recall work, we prioritize those appointments and—here we go—I can get you in Thursday at eight AM. Would that work?
406  Absolutely, one hundred percent covered—parts, labor, everything. We'll even provide a loaner vehicle if you need one, though most customers just wait since it's, you know, relatively quick.
407  Oh yes, definitely! I'll add a note right now about the clicking sound, and since they'll already be working on the steering column, it might even be related.
408  I've highlighted it in your file, and I'll personally mention it to Jake, our lead technician. Now, you'll get a confirmation text shortly with all the details—Thursday, eight AM sharp.
409  Just bring the recall notice if you have it handy, but honestly, we have everything in the system already. Oh, and your keys, obviously—sometimes people forget those!
410  Completely safe for normal driving, I promise. If you experience any actual steering problems before then—which is highly unlikely—just call us immediately, and we'll arrange a tow.
411  [Sigh] You know what, I'm just gonna—I'm gonna order pizza and watch something stupid, okay? [Chuckle] That's self-care, right?
412  [Fast] Honestly, if one more thing goes wrong today, I swear I'm just gonna lose it completely. [Groan] [Angry] Like, how is this even possible?
413  [Happy] Wait, my favorite show just dropped a new season! [Laugh] I mean, the day's been trash but at least there's, uh, there's that.
414  [Whisper] Maybe I should just, like, crawl into bed and pretend today never happened. [Slow] Tomorrow's gotta be better, right?
415  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because what I really needed was to spill coffee on myself too. [Tsk] Perfect ending to a perfect day.
416  [Disappointed] I thought treating myself to ice cream would help, but I'm still just—ugh, I dunno, empty? [Sigh]
417  [Shout] Okay, that's it! [Fast] I'm done feeling sorry for myself—gonna blast some music and just, like, dance it out!
418  [Slow] My mom always said bad days are just... um, what was it? [Chuckle] Something about tomorrow being a gift or whatever.
419  [Sad] I keep trying to—to find something good about today, but honestly? [Whisper] I got nothing.
420  [Happy] You know what, screw it—I'm gonna take a bubble bath with, like, all the fancy stuff I've been saving. [Laugh]
421  [Angry] Why do I even bother trying when everything just—[Groan] No, you know what? Not doing this to myself.
422  [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh look, my horoscope says today's gonna be great for new opportunities—bit late for that advice, stars.
423  [Disappointed] I had this whole plan to, um, to turn things around after lunch, but then I just... [Tsk] couldn't.
424  [Slow] Maybe I should call someone? [Sigh] Actually, no, I don't wanna dump all this on—never mind.
425  [Chuckle] At least my cat's happy to see me, even if I'm a total mess right now. [Happy] C'mere, buddy.
426  [Shout] [Angry] This day can officially bite me! I'm so—wait, is that wine still in the fridge?
427  [Whisper] Tomorrow I'll wake up and this'll all just be, like, a weird bad memory. [Slow] [Sad] Hopefully.
428  [Fast] Okay so basically I'm gonna make a list of—no wait, lists stress me out. [Laugh] Forget the list!
429  [Disappointed] I really thought today would be different, y'know? [Sigh] Like, I actually woke up feeling good for once.
430  [Happy] [Fast] Found twenty bucks in my jacket pocket—I mean, the day sucked but hey, surprise money's kinda nice!
432  Oh god, I know—I saw that and I meant to reply right away but then I got distracted and—wait wait, that's not an excuse, I'm not making excuses. I just... I'm really bad at this stuff, you know?
433  That's—okay, that's fair. That's totally fair and I'm being a complete hypocrite. [nervous laugh] I literally sent you like eight texts in a row last week asking if you were mad at me because you didn't reply for two hours. God, I'm the worst.
434  I don't even—I don't know why I do that? Like, honestly, I see your message and I think "oh I'll reply when I have more time to give a good response" and then I just... forget. But when you don't reply I immediately assume you hate me which is so—it's so stupid, I know.
435  No no no, you're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—[sigh]—I'm sorry. I've been a really shitty friend about this. Like, expecting you to be available 24/7 when I can't even remember to text back? That's messed up.
436  Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. That's—I didn't even think about the reservation and now you probably—they probably charged you a fee, didn't they? I'll pay you back, obviously, I'll Venmo you right now, I'm literally opening the app as we speak.
437  I know. I know it's not, it's about—it's about me being reliable, right? And I'm not. I'm really, really not and that's... that's gotta change. Like, starting now, I promise.
438  Yeah, I—yeah. But I mean it this time? Okay that sounds—every time someone says "this time is different" it's never different but I swear I'm gonna actually try. Maybe I'll set reminders or something, I dunno, but I gotta figure this out because I can't keep doing this to you.
439  Wait, you—you've been upset about this for a while? And you didn't say anything? [groan] Because you knew I'd just apologize and not change, right? God, I really am that person. The flaky friend who everyone just... puts up with.
440  That's—okay now I'm gonna cry. You're my best friend too and I've been treating you like—like you don't matter as much as my stupid anxiety about replying perfectly and that's so backwards. You matter more than anyone. You really do.
441  Yes. Yes, absolutely. Even if it's just an emoji or—or whatever, I'll respond. And I'll stop freaking out when you take a normal amount of time to reply because that's—that's on me, not you. I'm really, really sorry. Thank you for... for telling me instead of just giving up on me.
443  [defensive] Look Mom, the Ferber method is backed by research. [speaking faster] We check on her every five minutes, then ten, then fifteen. [firmly] She's learning to self-soothe, and it's only been three nights so far.
444  [exhausted sigh] Mom, I haven't slept more than two hours straight in eight months. [pleading] The pediatrician recommended this. [more firmly] Besides, crying for a few minutes won't damage her emotionally—that's just outdated thinking from your generation.
445  [controlled frustration] It's been exactly four minutes, Mom. [checking watch nervously] One more minute and I go in. [defensive whisper] This is harder for me than her—she won't even remember this tomorrow morning.
446  [voice breaking] That's not fair and you know it! [steadying breath] I'm teaching her healthy sleep habits. [desperately] Do you think I enjoy this? My heart breaks every single time, but it's working—she slept six hours last night!
447  [near tears] You think I don't know that? [angry whisper] Every instinct screams at me to run in there! [voice cracking] But I'm drowning here, Mom. I need sleep to function, to work, to be a good parent.
448  [long pause] That's... that's really sweet, Mom. [conflicted] But what happens when you leave? [frustrated groan] We'd be right back where we started, except now she'd be even more confused about bedtime.
449  [defensive shout] Because we know better now! [calming down] We have studies about SIDS, about attachment, about sleep cycles. [determined] I'm not just winging it like your generation did—I'm making informed decisions here.
450  [breaking down] Stop it, just stop! [sobbing] You think this is easy for me? [angry tears] Every night I question everything, wonder if I'm ruining her, but at least I'm trying something!
451  [sniffling] It's been five minutes. [determined exhale] I need to go check on her now. [steadier voice] Just a quick pat, reassuring words, then back out. Want to watch on the monitor with me?
452  [relieved whisper] Thanks Mom. [hopeful] Listen—she's already calming down. [amazed] Yesterday it took twenty minutes, today just seven. [trembling laugh] Maybe this really is working. God, I hope I'm doing the right thing.
453  [professionally calm] I understand your frustration, sir. May I please have your member ID and date of birth to pull up your account? I'll need to verify a few things before we can discuss the specifics of your case.
454  Thank you, Mr. Peterson. [pause] I see here the denial was issued on February 8th for insufficient medical necessity documentation. Your provider submitted forms A-1127 and B-3342, but we're still missing the prior authorization supplement.
455  Sir, I'm showing those faxes were received but... they were sent to our old processing center. As of January 1st, all prior authorizations need to go to department PA-7700 at our Memphis location.
456  I do apologize for the confusion, Mr. Peterson. [professionally] I can expedite a new review if your doctor resubmits to fax number 901-555-8827. [reassuring] With proper documentation to code PA-7700-SURG, we can have an answer within 72 hours.
457  [uncomfortable] Unfortunately, our system doesn't allow transfers between departments. However, I can escalate this to supervisor review, case number EMG-2024-0298. They might be able to override if you file an urgent appeal by tomorrow at 5 PM Eastern.
458  Sir, I'm trying to help you here. [more patiently] You'll need form URA-2024, available under "Member Resources," then "Appeals," then "Urgent Medical." [precisely] Make sure to include your reference number, which is now MED-47562-BD4789-UR.
459  That's B-David-4789-UR, correct. No notarization needed for urgent appeals, just your signature and your physician's NPI number. But it must be submitted electronically through our portal, not faxed or mailed.
460  Out-of-network reimbursement requires pre-approval through form OON-789. Without prior authorization, we can only reimburse at 20% of the Medicare rate. For procedure 47562, that would be approximately $1,200 of the $18,000 cost.
461  [defensively] Mr. Peterson, we approve 87% of all submitted claims. I genuinely want to help resolve this for you. If you submit the appeal by tomorrow with case number EMG-2024-0298, I'll personally flag it for expedited review.
462  That's correct, and please reference my employee ID, T-9923-Austin, in your appeal. I've made detailed notes in your file about today's call at 2:47 PM. Is there anything else I can help clarify about the appeals process today?
463  Thank you for calling TechFlow Solutions, this is Marcus speaking. [quickly] How can I assist you with your software today?
464  I'm really sorry to hear you're experiencing those problems. Let me pull up your account and we'll get this sorted—what's your subscription email?
465  Got it, I see your account here, Ms. Johnson. The freezing issue is actually a known bug we're addressing—our team pushed a hotfix about an hour ago.
466  The patch might not have auto-installed yet. Can you check your version number—bottom left corner, help menu, then about?
467  That's the old version, the fix is 4.2.3. Good news though—I can manually push the update to your system right now, should only take about two minutes.
468  That's incredibly frustrating, I understand. The new version has an auto-recovery feature that might—and I stress might—retrieve your recent work from the cache files.
469  Absolutely understood. I'm initiating the update now—you should see a prompt—and I'm also adding a service credit to your account for the inconvenience.
470  [briskly] I'm applying a full month's credit, that's $89 value. Plus, I'm escalating this to ensure you get priority queue status for any future support needs.
471  Just restart the application once it hits a hundred percent. Then check the File menu for "Recover Recent Work"—fingers crossed your data is there.
472  Excellent! Click "Restore All" and let it process—should have everything back within thirty seconds or so.
473  [Angry] Are you—are you kidding me right now? [Shout] I literally checked the status like five minutes ago!
474  [Disappointed] So that's it, huh? [Sigh] Three months of planning and it's just... gone.
475  [Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, this is just, um, exactly what I needed today. [Tsk] Perfect timing, really.
476  [Fast] Wait wait wait, I gotta—I need to call my boss right now or I'm totally screwed. [Groan]
477  [Whisper] I can't tell my mom about this, she's gonna absolutely lose it if she finds out I'm not coming.
478  [Happy] Actually, you know what? [Laugh] Maybe this is the universe telling me I wasn't supposed to go anyway!
479  [Slow] Let me, uh, let me get this straight here... [Disappointed] Every single flight today is just done?
480  [Sad] I was finally gonna see them after—god, it's been what, two years? [Sigh] [Slow] Two whole years.
481  [Angry] [Fast] Okay so basically you're telling me that nobody thought to mention this earlier? Like, nobody?
482  [Chuckle] My ex is on that flight too, so honestly? [Happy] This might be the best thing that's ever happened to me!
483  [Disappointed] I mean, I kinda had a feeling something would go wrong, but... [Tsk] not this.
484  [Shout] How is "mechanical issues" even an excuse anymore? [Angry] It's 2024 for crying out loud!
485  [Whisper] [Sad] The funeral's tomorrow morning and I—I don't know how I'm gonna make it now.
486  [Sarcastic] Sure, yeah, a voucher for fifty bucks will totally make up for missing my wedding. [Tsk] [Angry] Thanks so much.
487  [Fast] [Happy] Oh my god, wait—if I'm stuck here, that means I can actually go to Sarah's party tonight!
488  [Slow] You know what's funny? [Chuckle] I literally had a dream about this exact thing happening last night.
489  [Sad] [Whisper] I just wanna go home, I'm so tired of—I can't do this anymore, I really can't.
490  [Angry] [Fast] No no no, don't put me on hold again, I've been—hello? HELLO?
491  [Disappointed] [Slow] Guess I'm, uh, guess I'm sleeping in the airport tonight then, right?
492  [Sarcastic] [Laugh] Twenty-three hours of delays would've been fine, but cancelled? Now that's just special.
494  Oh god, I—I know, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get that drunk, honestly I thought I was fine and then suddenly everything just hit me all at once and—
495  I know, I know, it was—it was awful. Like, I woke up this morning and literally wanted to die when I remembered. Wait, no, that's not—I mean, I feel terrible about it. [groan] I can't believe I did that to you.
496  Yeah, I—okay, so here's what happened. I had the three shots, right? But then Karen from accounting kept buying rounds and I didn't wanna be rude, y'know? And I thought—I thought I could handle it because I'd eaten dinner but apparently not.
497  No, she—she wasn't. That was all me. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. I literally ruined your whole work party, didn't I? Your boss probably thinks you hang out with total disasters now.
498  He what? Oh my god, no no no, I'm not—I don't have a problem, I swear. It was just one stupid night where I didn't—I wasn't paying attention to how much I was drinking and I'm so, so sorry.
499  Okay, that's—that's fair. The birthday thing was bad too. And New Year's. But I promise you, like genuinely promise, I'm gonna get better about knowing my limits. I don't wanna be that friend, y'know? The one who always—[sigh] the one who always makes everything about their drama.
500  I know you did and I—I owe you so much for that. Like, you could've just left me there but you didn't and... I'm gonna make this up to you, okay? Whatever you need. I'll call your boss, apologize personally, pay for dry cleaning, literally anything.
501  Right, yeah, no—of course not. That would be... yeah. Um, but seriously though, there's gotta be something I can do? I hate that I put you in that position. Like, you were so excited about this party and I just—I ruined it completely.
502  I did. I really, really did. And I'm—look, I know saying sorry doesn't fix it but I need you to know that I'm gonna do better. No more drinking at your work things, actually maybe no more drinking period for a while because clearly I can't—I can't trust myself right now.
503  Yeah? Okay, then—then that's what I'm doing. Stone cold sober from now on, at least until I figure out how to not be a complete disaster. And I'm—I'm really sorry. You're like my best friend and I hate that I embarrassed you like that. It won't happen again, I promise.
504  I know, I know, okay? But my mom literally called me crying about my grandma being in the hospital and I—I had to go. What was I supposed to do?
505  I did tell you! I texted you like—okay, maybe it was last minute, but everything happened so fast. [frustrated laugh] We were literally in the car already when I remembered to message you.
506  Yeah, and I'm sorry about the timing, but come on—my grandma was having chest pains. You're acting like I just decided to skip it for fun or something.
507  I know that, and I wanted to be there, I really did. But you're—you're making it sound like I had a choice here. Family emergencies don't exactly schedule themselves around our plans, y'know?
508  That's not—okay, that's not fair. Everyone else wasn't dealing with their grandma potentially dying. [sigh] Look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but this is kinda harsh.
509  And I needed to be with my family! God, why is that so hard for you to—I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I missed it. But I'm not gonna apologize for prioritizing my grandma.
510  Fine? That's it? Just "fine"? You know what, I'm getting pretty frustrated here too because it feels like you don't even care about what I was going through that night.
511  That's—wow. That's really what you think? I've been to every single other thing you've done. Every open mic, every rehearsal you wanted me at. One time—ONE time—I can't make it because of an actual emergency and suddenly I don't care?
512  Yeah, and I feel terrible about that, honestly I do. But you're not—[scoff] you're not even trying to understand. Like, at all. My grandma could've died and you're mad about a show.
513  I know it wasn't just—look, I know how much it meant to you, okay? And maybe I should've... I dunno, tried harder to explain or something. But I'm not gonna stand here and pretend I made the wrong choice. I didn't.
514  Um, okay? What's—what's going on? You've been weird all week and now you're doing this whole dramatic thing where you're like... I dunno, being all intense.
515  That's—okay, that's not even true. I checked it maybe like three times? Four? And honestly, you're always telling me stuff while I'm trying to work, so—[scoff] sorry if I had to respond to my boss.
516  Wait, what? When did—why didn't you say that? You were just talking about random stuff, I didn't know it was... I mean, you gotta tell me these things.
517  No, you—okay okay, maybe you mentioned something but you didn't say it was serious. You're always so casual about everything, how was I supposed to know this was different? [frustrated laugh] I'm not a mind reader.
518  Look, if you said that—and I'm not saying you didn't—but if you did, I obviously didn't hear it properly. Maybe I was distracted, fine, but you could've like, I dunno, made sure I was listening?
519  That's not—come on, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry about your dad, I am, that's terrible. But you're acting like I don't care when really I just... [sigh] I literally had three deadlines yesterday.
520  See, this is what you do. You make it sound like—like my stuff doesn't matter at all. Yeah, they're not family emergencies, but I can't just ignore my whole life every time you need to talk.
521  I know, I know! And I'm—I feel terrible about missing that, okay? But honestly? You do this thing where you just expect me to drop everything, and usually I do, but yesterday was literally the worst possible day.
522  Oh my god, stop. That's so—you're being so unfair right now. I've been there for you through everything, literally everything, and the one time I'm not perfect, you're gonna—what, throw away our whole friendship?
523  I—okay. You're right. [quieter] How is he? Is he gonna be okay? I should've—yeah, I should've asked that first. I'm just... I'm defensive 'cause I feel like shit about this, y'know?
524  What? Wait, I—hold on, what do you mean? I thought we were—I mean, after everything that happened, I figured we just kinda... moved past it?
525  Okay, that's—that's not what I meant. I just, um, I thought since we were still hanging out and stuff that you weren't—[nervous laugh] god, I'm such an idiot. You've been upset this whole time, haven't you?
526  No no no, you're right. You're totally right. I should've—I mean, obviously I should've actually talked to you about it instead of just... pretending nothing happened. That was really messed up of me.
527  I honestly don't know why I didn't say anything. Like, I knew I hurt you—I could see it on your face when it happened, y'know? And I just... I dunno, I got scared? [groan] That's not an excuse though.
528  God, I'm—I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I was being a coward, basically, and that's not fair to you at all. You deserved an apology right away, not... whatever this is.
529  The comment about—about your presentation, right? When I said it was "kinda basic" in front of everyone? I've been replaying it in my head and I just—ugh, I wanna crawl into a hole every time I think about it.
530  Wait wait wait, there's more? Oh god—was it also when I laughed? Because I swear I wasn't laughing at you, I was just nervous and—actually no, that doesn't matter. Impact over intent, right? I hurt you and that's what matters. [sigh]
531  I did. I literally watched you stay up till like 3 AM working on it for weeks. And then I just—I opened my stupid mouth and ruined it. I'm so, so sorry. I should've been supporting you, not... being an absolute jerk.
532  Because I'm—I'm really bad at confrontation? And the longer I waited, the worse it got, and then I convinced myself that bringing it up would make things weird when really I was already making things weird by not saying anything. Classic me, honestly, making everything worse.
533  I know. And I'm sorry—not just for what I said, but for taking this long to apologize. You're one of my best friends and you deserved so much better than... than me being too scared to own up to my mistakes. Can we—can we be okay?
534  Got in? Got in where? Wait—oh my god, is this about the residency thing? The one in, um, where was it again?
535  Shut up shut up shut UP! Are you—this is huge! Like, this is literally what you've been working toward for, what, two years now? [Gasp] Oh my god, when do you leave?
536  Okay okay, I mean, yeah, of course you're still processing because this is like—this changes everything, right? You're gonna have actual time to just... create. No distractions, no stupid day job stuff.
537  Wait, terrifying? But you—honestly, you've been complaining about never having enough time for your work since, like, forever. Isn't this kinda exactly what you wanted?
538  Oh no no no, okay, I get it now. The whole—the pressure thing. But like [Sigh] you wouldn't have gotten in if they didn't already think your stuff was incredible, y'know?
539  That's—wait, that's like less than, um, two percent? Holy shit. You beat out literally hundreds of people and you're worried about—actually, you know what? This is so you.
540  I mean, you always do this thing where something amazing happens and you immediately start, like, catastrophizing about it? Remember when you got that gallery show and spent the whole week before convinced everyone would hate it? [Chuckle]
541  Was it though? Was it really? Because from where I'm sitting, it's the same exact—you're doing that face. The one where you know I'm right but you're gonna be stubborn about it anyway.
542  Okay but like—nobody's ever ready ready, right? That's kinda the whole point of these things. You go, you figure it out, you probably have some breakdowns in the studio at 2am, and then you make something incredible.
543  Um, are you kidding me right now? If you don't go, I will literally—I don't know what I'll do but it'll be dramatic and you'll hate it. This is your thing, babe. Your actual thing.
545  [voice breaking] Mom always said she wanted to be scattered here, [quieter] where Dad proposed. [Sharp inhale] I keep thinking she's going to walk up behind us and laugh about how we're doing it all wrong.
546  [firmly] We should say something. [more uncertainly] She deserves words, proper ones. [clearing throat] Though everything I practiced in the car sounds stupid now that we're actually standing here with the urn.
547  [suddenly urgent] Wait, wait—are we doing this too fast? [panicked] Once she's in the wind, that's it. [voice dropping] No more putting flowers on a grave, no place to visit when we need her.
548  [defensive] My jokes aren't terrible! [cracking] She laughed at every single one. [whispered] Even the really bad ones about chickens crossing roads. Sometimes I still catch myself saving the good ones to tell her.
549  [rushed words] The wind's picking up—should we do it now? [steadier] Together, like we promised? [Shuddering breath] I can't believe this is really happening, that we're really saying goodbye to her forever.
550  [determined] One. [more shakily] This is for all the bedtime stories and band-aids. [Gulping breath] For every time she said she was proud of us even when we didn't deserve it.
551  [in unison] Three. [Soft gasp] Oh God, look at her go—she's dancing in the sunlight. [through tears] The way the ashes catch the light, it's actually beautiful, like she's becoming part of everything.
552  [exhausted] My hands won't stop shaking. [quieter] Is it wrong that I already miss having the urn to hold? [Ragged breath] At least that was something solid, something that proved she existed.
553  [suddenly clear] We should head back before dark. [gentler] But maybe we could stop at that diner she loved? [Sniffling] Order her usual and leave the seat empty—one last meal together.
554  [peaceful] The water's so calm now. [in wonder] Like it was waiting for her. [Deep breath] I think I finally understand why she chose this place—it's not an ending, it's a joining.
555  Good afternoon, Mr. Brennan, this is Sarah from Willowbrook Care Center. I'm sorry to hear you have concerns. [more gently] Could you please verify your mother's patient ID number—it should start with WB2024—so I can pull up her file?
556  Mr. Brennan, I sincerely apologize for these issues. I'm looking at her care log right now, and——well, I do see a notation here. Could you tell me which staff members she mentioned specifically?
557  Sir, I understand your frustration completely. [more firmly] However, our records indicate housekeeping visited room 247-B on Monday at 2:15 PM and Wednesday at 3:30. Perhaps there's been some miscommunication with your mother?
558  [quickly] No, no, absolutely not, Mr. Brennan. I'm simply trying to understand the full situation here. Would you like me to schedule an immediate meeting with our director, Mrs. Chen, tomorrow at, say, 10:30 AM?
559  Mr. Brennan, please, let's resolve this internally first. [more earnestly] I'm escalating this right now to our quality assurance team, case number QA-2024-11-0892. We take every concern seriously, and I promise we'll have answers by tomorrow morning.
560  Good morning, this is Riverside Veterinary Clinic! I see you've emailed about appointment availability—let me just pull up our schedule. How can I help your pet today?
561  [sympathetically] Oh, I understand that's concerning. Let me check what we have—actually, we had a cancellation for tomorrow at 2 PM. Dr. Martinez is excellent with cats, especially nervous ones.
562  Yes, absolutely, it's a full 30-minute consultation slot. Dr. Martinez can do blood work, urinalysis, whatever's needed. The initial exam is $85, and we'll discuss any additional tests during the visit.
563  [calmly] Just bring his vaccination records if you have them. No need for samples unless the doctor requests them after examination. Oh, and maybe bring his favorite blanket—sometimes that helps with stress.
564  Cover the carrier with a towel, helps reduce visual stimulation. Some clients spray Feliway about 15 minutes before—it's a calming pheromone. We sell it here, but pet stores have it too.
565  [Nervous] So, uh, anyway... [Fast] should we maybe talk about literally anything else right now or—no? We're just gonna sit here? [Chuckle]
566  [Whisper] I feel like I should say something but honestly I don't—I mean, what do you even say after that? [Sigh]
567  [Sarcastic] Wow, this is fun. [Slow] Really enjoying the, um, the whole nobody-talking thing we've got going on here. [Tsk]
568  [Happy] You know what, I actually kinda like this! [Laugh] No pressure to make conversation, just... existing together, right?
569  [Angry] Are you seriously not gonna—look, somebody needs to say something because this is getting ridiculous! [Groan]
570  [Slow] Does anyone else hear that clock ticking or is it just—[Fast] okay yeah, it's definitely getting louder somehow. [Nervous] [Chuckle]
571  [Disappointed] I thought we were past this whole, you know, not being able to talk to each other thing. [Sigh] Guess not.
572  [Shout] WELL THEN! [Normal] That's, uh, that's one way to end a conversation, I guess.
573  [Fast] So my cat did this really funny thing yesterday where she—actually, you probably don't wanna hear about that right now, do you? [Tsk]
574  [Sad] This is exactly what happened last time and I just—I can't do this again, okay? [Sigh] [Whisper] Not again.
575  [Sarcastic] Anyone wanna play a game where we count how many seconds this lasts? [Chuckle] I'm at thirty-seven, but who's counting, right?
576  [Slow] You ever notice how, like, silence can be really loud sometimes? [Fast] This is one of those times, definitely one of those times.
577  [Happy] Oh my god, are we having a moment? [Laugh] [Whisper] Is this what people mean by comfortable silence?
578  [Angry] I didn't drive all the way here to just—to sit in silence! [Disappointed] Come on, somebody say something!
579  [Fast] Okay so basically what I'm hearing is nothing, which is—that's cool, that's totally fine, I can work with nothing. [Nervous] [Chuckle]
580  [Whisper] Should I just... leave? [Normal] Like, would that make this less weird or more weird? [Tsk]
581  [Sarcastic] Great weather we're having. [Slow] Oh wait, we're inside, so... great ceiling we're having? [Groan]
582  [Sad] I used to be really good at filling these gaps but now I just—I dunno, I got nothing. [Sigh]
583  [Shout] ANYBODY WANT COFFEE? [Fast] I'm gonna go make coffee, that's what I'm doing, coffee fixes everything! [Nervous] [Laugh]
584  [Disappointed] We literally just met and we're already out of things to—[Slow] wow, this doesn't bode well, does it? [Tsk] [Sigh]
586  Oh my god, oh my god—wait, and? What did they—I mean, I know you had the blood test thing on Monday, right? Tell me everything.
587  It—wait, what? [Gasp] Are you saying—oh my god, are you actually pregnant right now? Like, right this second?
588  I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry. No no no, I'm already crying. After everything you've been through, all those months of—god, how are you even feeling right now?
589  Okay, yeah, that's—that's totally normal though, right? I mean, this is huge. Like, you've wanted this for so long and now it's actually... happening. [Soft laugh] Your brain probably doesn't even know what to do.
590  I know, babe. I know. And you were so—I mean, after the second one didn't work, you were basically ready to give up, remember? But you didn't. You kept going.
591  Oh god, of course she did—she's been waiting for this almost as long as you have. Actually, no, scratch that, nobody's been waiting as long as you. This is—this is your moment, y'know?
592  Okay, hey—no no no, we're not doing that. [Sigh] I mean, I get it, I totally get why your brain's going there, but like... can we just sit with the good news for a minute? Just let it be good?
593  You're not—stop, you're not being weird at all. You're being, like, incredibly human right now. After everything your body's been through? All those hormones and procedures and just... the hoping? You're allowed to feel whatever you're feeling.
594  Wait, you—[Chuckle] oh my god, you never told me that. That's so... okay, that's actually breaking my heart a little bit. In the best way though, because now you're gonna—you're actually gonna need it.
595  Come here—I need to hug you right now. Like, immediately. This is the best news I've heard in... honestly? Maybe ever. I'm so freaking happy for you.
596  Um, okay? That's—that's kind of ominous. What's going on? Did I do something wrong or...?
597  I—what? That's what this is about? Come on, you know I'm terrible at that stuff. I've been swamped with work and—okay okay, I get that's not an excuse, but seriously?
598  That can't be—[scoff] are you actually keeping track? Look, I respond when you text me, don't I? I show up when we make plans. I'm not like, ignoring you.
599  No, that's not—you're twisting what I'm saying. I care about this friendship, obviously, but you're acting like I don't just because I'm not great at reaching out first. That's kinda unfair.
600  And I appreciate that, I do, but maybe—maybe you could've mentioned this before it became this huge thing? Instead of just... [frustrated laugh] sitting there resenting me for months?
601  I am busy! That's—I mean, that's actually true. But okay, fine, I could've made more effort. I just didn't realize it was bothering you this much.
602  Wow. That's—wow. I do care, and you know that. Or you should know that. Just because I don't text first doesn't mean I don't think about you or—this is ridiculous.
603  Yeah, kinda! You're basically saying our entire friendship is one-sided, which—that's not true. I literally helped you move last month. I came to your thing when nobody else did. But sure, I'm a terrible friend.
604  It's what you're implying though. Look look, I get it—I should reach out more. [sigh] And I will, okay? But you gotta understand, it's not personal. I'm like this with everyone.
605  I—yeah. Yeah, you're right. It doesn't. I dunno what else to say here. I'm sorry I made you feel like you're not important to me, but I'm also kinda hurt that you think I don't care.
606  What? Oh come on, that was just—I was kidding around. Everyone was laughing, you were laughing too! I didn't think you'd actually be upset about it.
607  Okay okay, but like—you gotta understand, I genuinely didn't know it would bother you. We joke about everything, literally everything, and now suddenly this is off limits? [scoff] How was I supposed to know?
608  Personal? We've made way worse jokes about each other before! Remember when you called me a disaster at relationships for like, three months straight? But I can't make one comment about—fine, whatever.
609  I don't—I really don't see how it's different. Look, I'm sorry it hurt your feelings, okay? But you're acting like I deliberately tried to [frustrated laugh] humiliate you or something, which is kinda unfair.
610  That's not—ugh, that's not what I was doing! I was making fun of the situation, not you. The whole nepotism thing is just—it's funny because it's obviously not true. Everyone knows you earned it.
611  Yes! Of course they do! But now you're making me feel like the worst friend ever for what was literally just a dumb throwaway joke that I—I didn't think about it that hard, okay?
612  Okay but—hold on, that's not fair either. I'm supposed to analyze every single thing I say now? We were all just having fun and I—look look, I get that it stung, but you could've just told me right then instead of giving me the silent treatment.
613  Um, yeah? Obviously? But instead you just sat there and let me think everything was fine when apparently [sigh] you were seething the whole time. That's kinda on you too, y'know?
614  I'm not—I'm not turning it around, I'm just saying we both could've handled this better. And honestly? I'm a little disappointed that after all these years, you'd think I'd ever wanna actually hurt you.
615  No, but it should at least count for something, right? Like—I dunno, maybe you could cut me some slack here since I clearly didn't mean it the way you took it? Just—whatever, forget it.
616  I know, I know, I'm—god, I'm so sorry. I kept meaning to pay you back, I swear, but then my car broke down and—wait, that's not an excuse, I'm not trying to make excuses.
617  Yeah. Two hundred. Um, listen, I—I actually have some of it? Like, I have about eighty right now, and I can—I mean, I get paid next week so I can definitely get you more then. [nervous laugh] This is so embarrassing.
618  I did say that, didn't I? Shit. I really—I really thought I could do it, y'know? But then everything just kinda... fell apart. My hours got cut at work and I—no, wait wait, I'm doing it again. Making excuses.
619  You're right. You're totally right. I should've just—I should've told you, like, immediately when I knew I couldn't pay you back. Instead of just... avoiding it. Avoiding you, honestly. [sigh] That was really shitty of me.
620  Oh god, really? That's—fuck, I'm the worst. I literally saw your texts and I just couldn't—I dunno, I panicked? Like every time I went to reply I just felt so guilty that I couldn't—that's so stupid, I know that's stupid.
621  I know. I know you would've, that's what makes this worse, right? Like, you're literally the most understanding person and I just—I was so ashamed, I guess. Still am, obviously. Really, really ashamed.
622  No no no, I remember. For your—for your rent, right? Did you—please tell me you didn't get in trouble with your landlord because of me. [groan] Please.
623  Okay so here's what I'm gonna do—I'm gonna give you the eighty now, and then, um, I can pick up some extra shifts. My manager said—actually, doesn't matter. Point is, I'll have the rest in two weeks. Actually two weeks this time.
624  Yeah, that's—that's fair. But I mean it this time, I swear. I'll literally set up like an automatic transfer or something so I can't chicken out again. Would that—would that be okay?
625  It won't. Ever. I promise. And I—thank you for not just writing me off completely. I know I don't deserve it but... yeah. Thank you. I'm really, really sorry I put you through this.
626  Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm so, so sorry. I literally had the worst night and I—wait, that's not an excuse, I just—
627  No no no, please don't—I feel terrible already. I had it in my calendar and everything, I swear I did, but then my mom called and—[groan] okay that sounds so lame but she was having this whole crisis about my dad and I couldn't just leave her like that, you know?
628  You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've—I meant to, honestly. I kept thinking "I gotta text them" but then my mom would start crying again and I'd have to—and then it was like midnight and I figured it was too late and you'd be even madder if I texted then.
629  That was—yeah, that was stupid. Really stupid. [nervous laugh] I kinda just froze up, y'know? Like the longer I waited, the worse it got, and then I couldn't figure out what to even say that wouldn't sound like total BS.
630  I know. God, I know, and that makes it so much worse. I had your present wrapped and everything—it's still sitting on my kitchen counter actually, which is just... I'm literally the worst friend ever.
631  I wanna make it up to you. Like, seriously, whatever you want—dinner, drinks, I'll throw you another party myself, I don't care. Just please let me—let me try to fix this somehow?
632  Right, no, of course not. That's not—I didn't mean it like that. [sigh] I just... I really messed up and I don't know how to—like, what do you need from me? Because I'll do it. Whatever it is.
633  I know. And I—I failed you. Completely. There's no excuse good enough, is there? Like nothing I say is gonna change that I wasn't there when you needed me to be.
634  Can we—would you maybe wanna get coffee tomorrow? Or whenever you're ready, I mean. No pressure. I just... I miss you and I hate that I hurt you like this.
635  Yeah, totally, take all the time you need. I'll—I'll wait. And um, for what it's worth... happy belated birthday. I really am sorry.
637  [shaky voice] I got the job offer yesterday. [Deep breath] It's in Seattle—the position I've dreamed about for years. [voice breaking] But I can't imagine leaving you, leaving everything we've built here together since college.
638  [through tears] They want me there by next month. [quivering] I haven't even said yes yet because every time I try, I picture your face. [Gasping breath] Remember when we promised we'd be each other's maids of honor?
639  [pleading tone] You could come with me! [desperately faster] There are tons of marketing jobs in Seattle, and we could get a place together like we always talked about. [Sniffling] Please, just think about it for a second.
640  [angry suddenly] Why does growing up have to mean growing apart? [louder] This is exactly what happened to my sister and her best friend! [Bitter sob] I swore I'd never let distance destroy us like that, ever.
641  [laughing while crying] Remember when we got matching tattoos and swore we'd live next door forever? [nostalgic tone] God, we were so naive. [Hiccupping sob] I'm going to miss our Tuesday wine nights more than anything else.
642  [relieved exhale] You really mean that? Even with the time difference and everything? [hopeful whisper] I've been so scared to tell you because I thought you'd hate me. [quickly] I've been carrying this secret for three days.
643  [sobbing harder] Stop being so supportive, you're making this worse! [laughing through tears] I had a whole speech prepared about how we'd stay close. [softer] But you already know we will, don't you? You always know everything.
644  [incredulous] Replace you? [louder and firm] You're literally tattooed on my ankle, you weirdo! [dropping to whisper] No one else would understand our synchronized period cry sessions or our elaborate revenge plots. You're stuck with me forever, distance be damned.
645  [overwhelmed] You already bought a ticket? [voice rising] Before I even accepted the job? [Soft sob] This is why I love you, you beautiful, presumptuous person. Of course you knew I'd take it before I did.
646  [whimpering] Come here, I need the biggest hug. [muffled against shoulder] We're going to make this work. [fiercely] Long distance friendship is nothing compared to what we've already survived. Seattle doesn't stand a chance against us, I promise.
647  [professionally] Thank you for contacting FastPass Support regarding violation notice TRL-892347-X. I'm, uh, having difficulty understanding your concern—are you disputing the vehicle color listed on your toll violation from Highway 47?
648  I can see account EZ-5739-ALPHA in our system, thank you. To clarify—you're saying your vehicle is burgundy, not silver as listed? [helpful tone] I'll need your license plate number to investigate this violation from Tuesday at mile marker 23.7.
649  Perfect, I've located plate 4XM92KP in our system. There's definitely a discrepancy here—your registered 2019 Honda Accord is listed as burgundy, but the violation photo from 3:47 PM Tuesday shows what appears to be a silver Toyota Camry.
650  Oh! You're suggesting someone has duplicate plates matching yours. [more seriously] This is actually a serious issue—plate cloning. If you were at 482 Oak Street at 3:47 PM, do you have any proof like a receipt or security footage we could reference?
651  Excellent! Transaction JC-20240315-1647 at 3:47 PM would indeed prove you weren't at the toll plaza. I'm escalating this to our fraud department as case #FRD-098234. We'll void violation TRL-892347-X and investigate the plate cloning issue—expect a follow-up within 48 hours.
652  [concerned] Three additional violations under your plate number? Let me pull those up... yes, I see them here, all from this week. Given the confirmed fraud on FRD-098234, I'm flagging all four violations for review immediately.
653  Your account balance of $127.43 will remain untouched—we're placing a hold on all disputed charges. That's $140 in base violations plus $67.80 in late fees, all suspended. We'll also add a fraud alert flag to account EZ-5739-ALPHA.
654  That's an excellent point about other toll agencies. I'll notify Bay Bridge Authority and Golden State Expressway about the plate cloning through our inter-agency alert system. Unfortunately, each agency handles their own violations, so you may need to contact them directly.
655  I've created inter-agency alert INTER-7823-ALERT and distributed it to seven regional toll authorities. Each agency should flag plate 4XM92KP for manual review before issuing violations. You'll receive confirmation emails at the address on file within the hour.
656  [advisingly] Yes, absolutely file form REG-14-B for replacement plates—that's the smartest move. [helpfully] The DMV can expedite it with our fraud case number FRD-098234 as reference. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or these violations?
657  [briskly] Good afternoon, welcome to Hartley's Department Store customer service. [speaking quickly] How can I assist you today—returns, exchanges, or something else I can help with?
658  I understand your frustration, truly. However, our price adjustment policy only covers items purchased within, um, seventy-two hours of a sale. [more firmly] Five days unfortunately exceeds that window.
659  Sir, I genuinely appreciate your loyalty to Hartley's. Let me check with my supervisor to see if there's any flexibility we can offer. Would you mind holding for just a moment?
660  Actually sir, I am getting my supervisor. We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at—Karen will be right with you, she has more authority for these situations.
661  [understanding] No need to apologize, these situations are frustrating. Karen says since you have your receipt and the item's unworn, we can make a one-time exception. How does store credit for the difference sound?
662  It's completely fine, really. Let me just process this for you—receipt please, and I'll need your phone number for our system. This'll take about two minutes, tops.
663  I know it seems strict, but with our frequent sales and promotions, we had to set some boundaries or we'd be constantly processing adjustments. [more personally] Between you and me, I think it's too short too.
664  Oh, that's very kind! I'm Marcus, and yes, you'll get an email survey within twenty-four hours. They are annoying, but corporate loves them, so...
665  [professionally cheerful] Happy to help save both your wallet and your marriage! Here's your thirty dollar store credit, valid for ninety days. Can I assist you with anything else while you're here?
666  [enthusiastically] Absolutely! Men's sale items are on the second floor, northeast corner near the escalators. We've got an additional twenty percent off clearance items today only.
667  [Disappointed] So he shows up forty-five minutes late, right, and his first words were—I kid you not—"You look different than your photos." [Tsk] [Sigh]
668  [Fast] [Angry] And then, and THEN, he actually asked me to split the bill after ordering, like, three appetizers I didn't even touch!
669  [Whisper] I literally hid in the bathroom for ten minutes just to, um, figure out an escape plan. [Chuckle] [Sad]
670  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, telling me about your ex for an hour straight is totally, uh, totally normal first date conversation. [Groan]
671  [Happy] [Laugh] Wait wait wait, the best part—he brought his mother's cookbook to show me his "signature recipes"!
672  [Slow] You know when you just... feel the chemistry dying in real time? [Disappointed] Like watching a plant wilt, honestly.
673  [Shout] HE TOOK A PHONE CALL FROM HIS DEALER! [Fast] Not like a car dealer—an actual, y'know, I had to leave immediately!
674  [Sad] [Sigh] I really thought this one would be different, but I guess I'm just—I dunno, maybe I'm expecting too much?
675  [Sarcastic] [Tsk] "You'd be prettier if you smiled more," he says, while literally chewing with his mouth open.
676  [Angry] The guy spent twenty minutes explaining why women shouldn't—actually, you know what, I can't even repeat it. [Groan] [Disappointed]
677  [Chuckle] I mean, bringing your emotional support ferret is one thing, but letting it eat off my plate? [Happy] [Laugh]
678  [Fast] [Whisper] So I'm sitting there thinking maybe I should just, like, pretend to get an emergency call or something when—
679  [Disappointed] [Slow] Three hours of my life I'm never getting back, and for what—some guy who thinks showering is optional?
680  [Shout] [Angry] HE ASKED THE WAITRESS FOR HER NUMBER! While I was sitting right there!
681  [Happy] At least the breadsticks were good, so, um, the evening wasn't a total loss, right? [Chuckle] [Sarcastic]
682  [Sad] [Whisper] I actually dressed up for this disaster—spent an hour on my hair and everything.
683  [Tsk] [Fast] He kept calling me by the wrong name even after I corrected him, like, four times—Katie, Cathy, everything but Karen!
684  [Slow] [Sigh] The red flags were basically, uh, doing the wave at me, but did I listen to my gut?
685  [Sarcastic] Nothing says romance like being asked if you "really need" to order dessert. [Angry] [Groan]
686  [Disappointed] [Chuckle] I should've known when his profile said "entrepreneur"—turns out that means, um, selling essential oils from his mom's basement.
688  Oh god, has it really been—wait, three months? No no no, that can't be right. I mean, we saw each other at... um... actually when was that party? [nervous laugh] Okay, you're right, I've been terrible.
689  I know, I know, and every time I felt like absolute garbage about it. It's just—work has been insane, like genuinely insane, and then my mom needed help with the house stuff and I—that's not an excuse though. I'm not trying to make excuses.
690  You're right. God, you're—you're totally right. I'm doing that thing where I just ramble and try to justify everything instead of just... I'm sorry. I've been a really shitty friend lately.
691  Okay, not just lately. Since like—since January maybe? When I got the promotion and started dating Alex and everything just kinda... [sigh] I basically disappeared on you. And that's not okay. Like, at all.
692  Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm—I'm the worst. I saw your text and I meant to call you back, I swear I did, but then I got pulled into this meeting and—no, that doesn't matter. I should've been there. I should've dropped everything and been there for you.
693  I don't—I don't even know how to apologize for that. Like, there's literally nothing I can say that makes it better. You've always been there for me, always, and the one time you really needed me, I just... wasn't.
694  No. No, it wasn't. [groan] I've been so caught up in my own stuff that I didn't even—I mean, I knew I was being distant but I kept telling myself "next week I'll make time" and then next week would come and I'd just... do it again.
695  Wait, what? When did you—oh. Oh, that's why it's been three months. Because I haven't... because you stopped reaching out and I didn't even notice. God, that's even worse somehow.
696  Can we—would you maybe wanna get coffee? Like right now? I know that doesn't fix anything, and I know you probably don't even want to, but I just... I miss you. I miss us. And I know that's my fault but—
697  Really? You'd actually—okay, yes, absolutely. Um, our usual place? I'll buy, obviously, and we can just... talk? Or not talk, if you don't wanna. I just—thank you. Seriously, thank you for even giving me the chance.
698  Got in? Wait wait wait—what do you mean you got in? Oh my god, is this about the—the volunteer thing?
699  Shut up! Are you serious? [Gasp] Oh my god, you actually—I mean, I knew you applied but like, wow, this is actually happening! When do you start?
700  This is so, so perfect for you. Like honestly? You've been talking about wanting to do this for—what, like a year now? Maybe more?
701  Two years! See, that's—that's even crazier. And you finally just went for it. What made you actually, y'know, pull the trigger?
702  Oh. Oh honey, that's—[Sigh] yeah, I remember you mentioning that. That must've been really hard to see.
703  People are just—ugh, I can't even. But like, at least now you're gonna be part of the solution, right? Making things better for these animals?
704  Okay no no no, none of this "we'll see" stuff. You're gonna be amazing at this. You're literally the most patient person I know—and animals? They totally sense that kinda energy.
705  Oh, you're definitely gonna get attached. Like, completely, ridiculously attached. [Chuckle] But isn't that—I mean, isn't that kinda the point? Caring enough to actually help?
706  Wait, are you already—oh my god, you're already thinking about adopting one, aren't you? This is day zero and you're already planning!
707  Uh-huh, sure, "just fostering." We both know you're gonna end up with like three dogs by Christmas. And honestly? I'm here for it.
709  [worried] I've been tracking my pulse, and it jumped from 72 to 74 [voice rising] when I stood up! [Gasp] That can't be normal. Plus, my left eyelid twitched twice this morning—I read that could mean a brain tumor.
710  [defensive] Sleep? How can I sleep when my pillowcase might be harboring bacteria? [whispered frantically] I wash it daily, but what if that's not enough? [louder] Yesterday, I sneezed three times in a row—definitely allergies or possibly early-stage pneumonia!
711  [high-pitched] But what about this freckle? [trembling] It's slightly darker than last Tuesday's photo! I've documented every mole with timestamped pictures. [urgently] And my tongue—look—there's a white spot that wasn't there during breakfast!
712  [rapidly] Meditation makes me notice my breathing, then I count breaths, then they seem irregular! [panicked whisper] What if I forget how to breathe automatically? [Nervous laugh] Also, my left knee clicked when I bent it—bone cancer?
713  [indignant] I use medical journals too! [quieter] Speaking of which, my urine was slightly yellower this morning. [building panic] Kidney failure starts subtly—I've prepared a color chart comparing every bathroom visit since Monday. Should we run labs?
714  [hurt] These feel like emergencies to me! [softer] What if we miss something important? [voice cracking] My grandmother ignored a headache once and—well, you know. [firmly] I just need reassurance that this weird ear pressure isn't serious.
715  [reluctantly] Maybe you're right about therapy. [hopeful] But first, could you check this rash? [quickly] It appeared after I used new soap, but rashes can indicate autoimmune disorders! I've photographed its progression hourly since yesterday evening.
716  [sheepishly] I actually already booked it for Thursday. [nervous laugh] But what if I get sick before then? [whispering] My throat feels slightly scratchy right now—strep? COVID? [regular volume] Something worse that starts with throat symptoms?
717  [brightening] You really think I'll be okay? [quieter] Sometimes I forget what feeling normal is like. [wistful] I used to play basketball without checking my pulse every timeout. [sadly] Now I carry a blood pressure cuff everywhere.
718  [determined] You're right, I'll try. [shakily] Starting tomorrow, no symptom googling before breakfast. [more confident] And I'll limit pulse checks to twice daily. [Nervous giggle] That's progress, right? Even if my stomach feels weird right now?
719  Good morning, this is Sarah from Premier Title Company. [slightly concerned] Could you please repeat your confirmation number more slowly? And just to clarify, are you referring to the closing scheduled for property 2847 Maple Drive?
720  Let me look that up for you, one moment please. I see here confirmation XB7-Q92-F for tomorrow at 10:30 AM. [helpfully] You'll need to bring a certified check for $47,892.50 and two forms of government-issued ID.
721  Sir, please don't worry, let me verify everything for you. The closing is indeed at 10:30 AM at our office, suite 205-B. The certified check amount includes your down payment, closing costs, and prepaids totaling exactly $47,892.50.
722  [slightly exasperated] That would be suite 205-B, second floor. The Closing Disclosure, or CD form, was already sent three business days ago. I can resend it now to the email address you just provided, is that J-A-M-E-S dot T?
723  Yes, both parties listed on the purchase agreement must attend. That would be you and Mary Buyer, correct? I'll need you both to sign approximately 127 documents, and the whole process typically takes about 90 minutes.
724  [with controlled patience] We're located at 1500 Commerce Street, yes. There's free validated parking in the attached garage, levels P1 through P3. Just bring your parking ticket to our office and we'll stamp it for you.
725  I'm afraid not, sir, it must be a certified or cashier's check. [more firmly] Personal checks cannot be accepted for closing funds per federal regulations. Your bank can issue a certified check this afternoon if you visit them before 4 PM.
726  Sir, we cannot accept cash payments over $10,000. [more seriously] It must be a certified check or wire transfer only. Would you like me to provide our wire instructions with routing number 021000021 and account 5567-8890-12?
727  [soothingly] Don't worry, being a few minutes late won't cancel your purchase. However, please do aim to arrive by 10:30 AM as scheduled. I'm emailing you a complete checklist right now with all requirements including the wire instructions just in case.
728  [wrapping up] I'll send the checklist to both email addresses you've provided. [informatively] Utility transfers should be scheduled for your closing date, March 15th. Is there anything else about tomorrow's 10:30 AM closing at suite 205-B that you need clarified? We'll see you and Mrs. Buyer tomorrow morning.
729  Alright, let's check your water softener settings real quick. Your hardness should be set to match your water test results—what number did you get, somewhere between 7 and 25 grains?
730  No worries, grains just measure how hard your water is. Did you get a test kit with the unit, or—actually, let me ask—when you run water, do you see white spots on dishes?
731  Every week? That's way too much salt—you're probably stuck in constant regeneration. [rapidly] Quick question: what's your capacity setting showing, and is the time display blinking or solid?
732  [quickly] No, no, we can fix this right now. That twelve hundred is your capacity—totally wrong for residential use. Press and hold the up arrow, then tap down twice when it beeps.
733  Perfect, that's your hardness setting! Twenty-five is actually pretty hard water, so that explains the spots. [more patiently] Now hit next—we need to set regeneration to, um, [calculating] probably every four days for your household.
734  You'll hear it regenerate at 2 AM—sounds like rushing water for about ninety minutes. [reassuring] The spots should disappear within a week, and your soap will get super sudsy, almost too much actually.
735  Ghost plumbers, that's a new one. Check salt monthly, not weekly—it should be at least one-third full, but never pack it to the top, that causes bridges.
736  Salt bridges are just hardened salt chunks that block water flow. [more briskly] Look, I'll email you our quick-start guide, but honestly, you're all set now—these settings should handle everything automatically.
737  Most customers never need those other buttons anyway. The guide covers the basics—hardness, regeneration time, and salt level indicators. Don't overthink it; water softeners are simpler than they seem.
738  Hey, nobody's born knowing water chemistry. You figured out the settings faster than most people do, and now you're good for probably years—just salt, wait, and enjoy spot-free dishes.
739  [Happy] Oh wow, you're the one who, um, who started that whole charity thing, right? [Fast] That's honestly incredible—I've been following your work for like months now!
740  [Nervous] [Laugh] I actually practiced what I was gonna say in the car, but now I'm just—yeah, totally blanking on everything.
741  [Slow] So I heard you're into rock climbing... [Chuckle] I mean, I've never tried it myself, but it seems kinda terrifying and amazing at the same time?
742  [Whisper] Between you and me, I was super nervous about meeting everyone today. [Fast] But you guys seem way more chill than I expected, so that's good.
743  [Sarcastic] Oh great, I just spilled coffee on myself—really nailing this whole "professional" thing, aren't I? [Groan]
744  [Happy] Your dog is literally the cutest thing I've ever—can I pet him? [Laugh] Sorry, I get kinda weird around animals.
745  [Fast] I know we just met, but I gotta say, your presentation earlier was like—it completely changed how I think about the whole project.
746  [Disappointed] I had this whole clever introduction planned, but then I, uh... [Sigh] I forgot your name already and now it's too awkward to ask.
747  [Slow] That's such an interesting perspective on—actually, I never thought about it that way before. [Chuckle] You're kinda blowing my mind here.
748  [Angry] No no no, I didn't mean it like—ugh, I'm totally messing this up. [Tsk] Let me start over, okay?
749  [Happy] [Fast] Wait, you're from Portland too? What are the odds—I grew up like right near Hawthorne district!
750  [Whisper] Is it just me, or is everyone here like, intimidatingly smart? [Nervous] [Laugh] I mean, I'm trying to keep up, but wow.
751  [Sarcastic] Yeah, I always wear my fanciest clothes to, um, to casual meetups. [Chuckle] Definitely didn't misread the invitation or anything.
752  [Sad] I'm usually better at this whole social thing, I swear—just having an off day, y'know? [Sigh]
753  [Shout] Oh my god, you know Sarah Chen? [Happy] [Laugh] She's literally my cousin—small world, right?
754  [Slow] So basically, what you're saying is—wait, sorry, I don't wanna put words in your mouth. [Tsk] Bad habit of mine.
755  [Fast] [Happy] I brought homemade cookies, which might be weird, but my grandma always said food breaks the ice, so... here we are!
756  [Disappointed] I thought I was early, but apparently everyone's been here for like an hour already? [Groan] Story of my life, honestly.
757  [Whisper] [Chuckle] Your boss is right behind me, isn't he? I just spent five minutes complaining about traffic and—yep, there he is.
758  [Angry] My GPS sent me to completely the wrong—whatever, I'm here now. [Fast] [Laugh] Nothing says "hire me" like showing up frazzled and sweaty, right?
760  Oh my god, I'm so—wait, you're here! I didn't think you were gonna make it! You said you had that thing with your mom and I just assumed—
761  You did? When? I—hold on, let me check my—[groan] okay yeah, there it is. I'm literally the worst. I got here early and then Marcus started talking to me about his whole breakup drama and I just... I completely spaced.
762  No no no, that's not—I'm not making excuses! I mean, I am, but like, I know that's not okay. I should've saved it regardless, y'know? I even put my jacket down but then this lady asked if anyone was sitting there and I just... caved.
763  I know how that sounds—it sounds terrible. It IS terrible. I'm terrible. I just, she seemed really tired and I thought—no, actually, I wasn't thinking. That's the problem. [nervous laugh] I literally wasn't thinking at all.
764  Wait, you've been here for twenty—oh god, why didn't you text me? I would've gotten up or—or found you somewhere else to sit or something!
765  You... oh. Oh no. [quieter] My phone's been on silent because of the presentation. I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, I feel awful. This is exactly the kind of thing I always do and I hate it—I hate that I'm like this.
766  That's—okay, I deserved that. But listen, can I at least—there's gonna be a break in like ten minutes and I'll get up, you can have my seat for the second half? Please?
767  It's not fine though! You're clearly upset and you have every right to be. I promised I'd—wait wait, actually, y'know what? Let me just get up now. Seriously, take my seat.
768  I will. I swear I will. I'm gonna—I'm literally putting like five reminders in my phone right now so this never happens again. And I'm buying you lunch after this, no arguments.
769  No, I really do. I wanna make it up to you. [sigh] Besides, I kinda owe you for last time too when I forgot about the movie, so... please? Let me at least do this?
770  Oh god. Oh no no no, listen—I can explain. Your mom called and she was asking all these questions about why you've been so quiet lately and I just—I didn't mean to say it, it just kinda slipped out.
771  I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But she was really worried and I thought—no wait, that's not—[groan] I wasn't thinking, that's the problem. I just wanted her to know you were getting help.
772  You're right. You're absolutely right and I'm—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I betrayed your trust and that's... that's unforgivable, I know.
773  I—yeah. Yeah, I do. Your parents are gonna freak out about the money and ask a million questions and probably try to get involved and—god, I'm such an idiot. [nervous laugh] I literally ruined everything you were trying to avoid.
774  I know, I know you did. And I promised I wouldn't and then I—I broke that promise. There's no excuse, I just... I got nervous when she called and the words just came out before I could stop them.
775  Twenty-three? Oh my god. That's—I didn't think she'd—okay no, that's a lie, I should've known she'd react like this. [sigh] I'm gonna fix this, okay? I'll call her back and tell her I was wrong or confused or something.
776  No. No, probably not. She's not gonna—once your mom knows something she doesn't just unknow it. But maybe I can like, I dunno, minimize the damage? Tell her it's just career counseling or something less... intense?
777  That's not—ugh, you're right. That's stupid. I'm just trying to—I wanna help somehow, y'know? Make it better? But I keep making it worse and I don't know what to do.
778  Done. Absolutely done. I'll block her number if you want—actually wait, that might seem suspicious. But I won't answer anymore, I promise. And I mean it this time, like actually truly mean it, not like before when I obviously failed spectacularly.
779  Yeah. Yeah, of course, take all the time you need. I just—I really hope we can get past this eventually because you mean everything to me and I... [quieter] I'm really, really sorry I hurt you.
780  I—okay, yeah, but he literally asked me if you were leaving the team. Like, directly asked. What was I supposed to say? "I dunno, maybe ask them yourself?" That would've basically confirmed it anyway.
781  That's—come on, that's ridiculous. He knows we talk every day. He knows we're best friends. If I said I didn't know, he'd know I was lying, and then what? [Scoff] Then I'm the shady friend who lies to everyone.
782  Wow. Okay, that's—that's really unfair. I've kept plenty of your secrets, y'know? Remember when you were dating Jamie and didn't want anyone to know? Or—or when you failed that certification? I never said anything about those.
783  I get that, I do, but you're acting like I just blurted it out for fun. Marcus cornered me in the break room and was like "Is it true?" What—what exactly [frustrated laugh] was my move there? Seriously, tell me what you would've done.
784  We didn't—okay okay, fine, we agreed I wouldn't tell people, but I didn't think that meant lying when someone asks directly. There's a difference between gossiping and—and being put on the spot. I mean, honestly, how did he even find out enough to ask?
785  Um, yeah? Kinda does? Because if someone else is talking about it, then maybe—maybe you should be mad at them instead of me. I'm just saying.
786  Right. Of course. Look look, I'm sorry it went down like this, okay? I am. But I'm also getting kinda frustrated that you won't even—[sigh] you're not even trying to understand how awkward that position was for me.
787  Yes! For me! I'm not—I'm not the bad guy here just because I cracked under pressure. And honestly? You putting me in a position where I have to lie to our other friends isn't exactly fair either.
788  But that's—that's the thing, I didn't volunteer it! He asked! There's a huge difference and you're just... you're ignoring that part completely. Like, I get you're mad, but you're being kinda unreasonable about this.
789  I didn't—ugh, whatever. Look, I'm sorry your secret got out, alright? I really am. But maybe next time don't tell me something if you're gonna expect me to become some—some master deflector when people ask about it directly. That's all I'm saying.
790  I know, I know, okay? I keep meaning to bring it back, but like—I literally get to my car and then remember when I'm already halfway to your place. It's not on purpose.
791  Because it's true! Look, I'm not trying to keep your stuff hostage or whatever you think is happening here. I just—my brain's been everywhere lately [frustrated laugh] and yeah, I keep forgetting.
792  And you'll get it back! I'm not saying you won't. But you're acting like I'm doing this to spite you when honestly, I've had like a million things going on and—okay, that's not an excuse, but still.
793  Fine, fine, I'll—wait, tomorrow? I can't tomorrow, I've got that thing I told you about weeks ago. See, this is what I mean, you're not even—[sigh] I can do Thursday.
794  That's not—okay that's technically true but come on, you know me. I'm not some thief. I've borrowed stuff before and always returned it, haven't I? This one time I'm having issues and suddenly I'm unreliable?
795  Look look, I get that you're frustrated, I do. But like—you could've reminded me earlier instead of just stewing about it and then ambushing me with all this disappointment, y'know?
796  Okay but those were like, texts in passing. You didn't say it was urgent or that you were getting this upset about it. I woulda prioritized it if I knew you were gonna—if it was this important.
797  That's—wow, that's kinda harsh actually. [scoff] I'm literally trying to explain, not make excuses. There's a difference. And honestly? You lending me something doesn't mean I'm suddenly obligated to rearrange my whole schedule.
798  You're right, you're right, I should've—but also, we're friends? Like, supposedly? And you're treating me like I'm some random person who stole from you instead of someone who just genuinely forgot during a really chaotic month.
799  I won't forget, Jesus. But um, just so we're clear—this whole conversation? Kinda makes me not wanna borrow anything from you again. Which maybe that's what you want, I dunno.
800  That's not—I don't always—look, I'm just trying to help you. Like, isn't that what friends are supposed to do? Give each other honest feedback?
801  Okay okay, but you're making it sound like I'm just tearing you down all the time, which is—that's not what's happening here. I literally only mention stuff when I think it could genuinely help you.
802  That's such an exaggeration and you know it. [Scoff] I mean, come on, last week you asked me what I thought about your presentation and I—what, I'm supposed to lie?
803  But your speaking voice is part of the presentation! I'm sorry, but like—I thought you'd wanna know you were mumbling so you could fix it before the actual thing. That's being supportive.
804  Yeah, actually, it is. Because pretending everything's perfect when it's not—that's not helping you. That's just, I dunno, enabling or whatever. And honestly? I thought you were stronger than this.
805  No no no, don't—I didn't mean it like that. [Frustrated laugh] I just mean, like, we've always been straight with each other, right? That's our thing. Since when did that become a problem?
806  One-sided? Are you—okay, that's actually kind of insulting. I ask for your opinion on stuff all the time and you give it to me straight. How is this different?
807  So I'm supposed to just watch you mess up and say nothing? Like when you were gonna wear that outfit to the interview—I should've just let you tank it?
808  Fine fine, you're right, it was. But I'm also allowed to—y'know what, I care about you succeeding. [Sigh] If that makes me the bad guy here, then I guess I'm the bad guy.
809  That's—wow. Okay. Um, I genuinely didn't know you felt that way. I thought I was being a good friend, but apparently I've just been, what, annoying you this whole time? That's really great to know.
811  [giggling uncontrollably] I know, I know! [voice trembling with joy] He proposed last night at the botanical gardens, right by the fountain where we had our first kiss. [whispers] I wanted to tell you in person, not over the phone.
812  [through tears] I barely slept! [increasingly giddy] I kept staring at it with my phone flashlight, taking pictures from every angle. [softer] Mom's going to absolutely lose her mind when she sees this—should we call her right now?
813  [warmly] Of course you are! [voice breaking] Who else would I want standing next to me? [Sniffles] We've been planning our weddings since we were seven with those plastic tiaras—this time it's real diamonds and actual cake!
814  [defensively sweet] Hey, Dave from accounting turned out pretty amazing! [teasingly] He writes me poetry on sticky notes and leaves them in my lunch. [voice dropping] Plus, he looks incredible in a suit—wait until you see him as a groom.
815  [gently] You better not upstage me! [mock sternly] But seriously, I can't imagine doing any of this without you. [whispers emotionally] We're really grown up now, aren't we? Like, this is actually our real adult lives happening.
816  [defensive] Oh wow, you look great as always. [bitter laugh] I've been trying this new diet, but [trailing off] work's been so stressful that I keep breaking it. [quietly] Emotional eating is real, you know?
817  [forced smile] Forget to eat? [incredulous] How does someone just forget? [getting louder] I think about food constantly—planning meals, counting calories, avoiding temptation. [sarcastic] Must be nice living in that magical world.
818  [Sharp exhale] Force yourself. [more bitterly] Meanwhile, I ate a salad for lunch and was starving an hour later. [frustrated growl] My metabolism is completely broken from years of yo-yo dieting. [defeated] Nothing works anymore.
819  [tense laughter] Intuitive eating? [sarcastically slow] My intuition says eat an entire pizza at midnight. [voice cracking] That's what got me here in the first place. [mumbling] Some of us don't have naturally thin intuition.
820  [exhausted tone] I've tried everything—trainers, keto, intermittent fasting. [building frustration] Spent thousands of dollars on programs and supplements. [hollow laugh] But sure, maybe weight lifting is the magic answer. [whispered] Just like everything else was supposed to be.
821  [long sigh] Genetic lottery. [more firmly] That's exactly what it is. [emotional] While you win that lottery, I'm fighting biology every single day. [voice breaking] And losing. Over and over again.
822  [bitter snort] Put-together? [incredulous whisper] I spend forty minutes every morning choosing clothes that hide my stomach. [getting faster] Confident is just code for "carries herself well for her size." [tired] But thanks, I guess.
823  [dry laugh] Sure, let's change the subject. [sarcastically sweet] Right after you ordered that green juice because you're "too full" from forgetting to eat. [sighing] Yes, I saw the show. [flatly] It was fine.
824  [suspicious tone] Why would you order something you don't want? [accusingly] To make me feel better about eating? [louder] I don't need your pity fries, Sarah. [controlled anger] I'm capable of ordering my own food.
825  [softening slightly] You're right. [heavy sigh] I'm sorry, I'm being awful. [ashamed whisper] It's just hard when everything feels so effortless for you. [steadier] Let's talk about that show—did you like the plot twist?
826  Yes, Mr. Henderson, your deductible applies per incident, not per year. [more patiently] Looking at your account here—address listed as 4782 Maple Drive—you've had three separate claims this year alone.
827  I see the confusion now. That promotional code expired on 06/30/2023, and it only applied to new policies anyway. Your current rate reflects two at-fault incidents from last year.
828  Sir, I'm reviewing incident report 2023-A-9847 right now. It shows you were, um, parked in a no-parking zone when Mr. Johnson's vehicle made contact at approximately 2:47 PM.
829  Rebecca Martinez did note that in your file on 08/15. However, that was contingent on no additional claims, and you filed another one on 09/22 for $3,200 in damages.
830  Comprehensive claims like wildlife collisions don't affect fault ratings, you're right. Actually, checking your member ID J-5578-K, you might qualify for our accident forgiveness program if you complete form AF-2024 by December 31st.
831  I completely understand your frustration, Mrs. Peterson. We've had an unexpected emergency with Dr. Miller's schedule, but I can offer you priority booking for tomorrow at eight-thirty.
832  [calmly] I know this isn't ideal, and we're truly sorry. If tomorrow doesn't work, we have... um, let me see... [briskly] Thursday at noon or Friday at four-fifteen?
833  I hear you're in pain, that must be awful. Would you like me to check if Dr. Kim has any cancellations today? She could see you for an emergency evaluation.
834  You're absolutely right, twelve years is a long time. [speaking faster] Let me speak with the office manager... actually, Dr. Miller just had a cancellation for three o'clock today!
835  Please don't do that, Mrs. Peterson. I'm blocking this appointment personally and I'll call you an hour before to confirm. We'll also waive your copay for the inconvenience.
836  [relieved] Thank you for giving us another chance. You're confirmed for three o'clock, and I'm... I'm making a note about the copay right now. Is that same cell number good?
837  Absolutely understood. I'm also going to email you confirmation right now, and I've flagged your account for VIP handling going forward.
838  It's not just words, I promise. You'll get reminder texts, priority scheduling, and [more slowly] my direct extension if there are ever any issues.
839  We'll take excellent care of you at three. Dr. Miller is fantastic with emergency cases, and he'll make sure you leave pain-free today.
840  It's already sent, check your inbox! We'll see you at three, Mrs. Peterson, and thank you for your patience with us today.
841  [Whisper] Oh god, this is, uh, this is definitely not the bathroom. [Fast] Sorry, sorry, I'll just—yeah, leaving now!
842  [Laugh] Well, this is awkward—I was looking for conference room B and somehow ended up in what looks like... is this a yoga class?
843  [Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Groan] Third door I've tried and I still can't find the stupid supply closet.
844  [Slow] Wait a minute, this doesn't look like—oh no. [Tsk] I'm on the wrong floor again, aren't I?
845  [Sarcastic] Oh great, perfect, just walked into someone's private office while they're on a video call—this day just keeps getting better. [Sigh]
846  [Happy] Oh my gosh, I didn't know we had a game room! [Chuckle] I mean, I'm supposed to be in accounting, but this is way cooler!
847  [Fast] Nope, nope, nope, backing out slowly—pretend you didn't see me eating lunch in here, okay?
848  [Disappointed] I thought this was gonna be the break room, but it's just another conference room. [Slow] Why does this building have, like, seventeen identical doors?
849  [Shout] WHOOPS! [Laugh] [Fast] Didn't mean to interrupt your presentation—I'll just, um, yeah, bye!
850  [Sad] I'm so lost, I don't even—I've been wandering around for like twenty minutes trying to find HR. [Sigh]
851  Everyone just, uh, keep doing what you're doing—I literally have no idea where I am right now. [Chuckle] [Whisper] So embarrassing.
852  [Angry] [Fast] This is ridiculous, the room numbers make absolutely no sense—who puts 201 next to 247?
853  [Happy] You know what, I'm kinda glad I walked in here by mistake 'cause this birthday cake looks amazing! [Laugh]
854  [Sarcastic] Sure, why not, let's just barge into the CEO's office—what's the worst that could happen, right? [Tsk] [Disappointed] I'm so fired.
855  [Whisper] [Slow] I'm gonna back away really slowly and hope nobody notices I just walked into their therapy session.
856  Is this not—wait, hold on, I thought today's meeting was in here? [Fast] Unless I got the day wrong, which would be, um, super embarrassing.
857  [Sad] [Slow] I just wanted to find somewhere quiet to make a phone call and now I'm interrupting what looks like a really serious meeting.
858  [Shout] OH! [Fast] Sorry, sorry—thought this was empty, didn't see you there in the dark! [Laugh] Nearly gave me a heart attack!
859  [Disappointed] Great, I've literally walked into a supply closet. [Sarcastic] Yeah, this is exactly where I wanted to end up after getting lost for ten minutes.
860  [Chuckle] Honestly, at this point I'm just gonna pretend I meant to come in here—fake it 'til you make it, y'know?
862  Wait wait wait—the actual corner office? Like the one with the—oh my god, with the windows? That's huge! I mean, that's literally what everyone wants, right?
863  Okay but like—you don't sound excited? This is kinda... I mean, shouldn't you be like, popping champagne or something? [Laugh] That office is basically the dream spot.
864  Fine? It's—no no no, something's up. You've been working toward this for like, what, three years? And now you're just... fine?
865  Oh. Oh shit, okay—are people being assholes? Because honestly, some people just can't handle when good things happen to others, y'know? It's like—it's their problem, not yours.
866  Ugh, Thompson's been coasting for like—I dunno, forever? Just because someone's been somewhere longer doesn't mean they're actually, you know, good at the job. [Sigh] That's gotta feel awkward though.
867  That's so—god, that's so petty. Like, what are we, in middle school? You earned this, okay? The bosses obviously saw something in you that he doesn't have.
868  See? That's—okay that's something! And honestly? Once everyone gets over their little feelings about it, they're gonna forget. It'll just be your office, y'know?
869  Well yeah, it's gonna feel weird at first—like, any change does. But you could get some plants maybe? Or like—ooh, one of those little rugs? Make it yours. [Chuckle]
870  Okay okay, fake ones then! Nobody has to know. But seriously though—you worked really hard for this. Don't let Thompson or whoever make you feel like you shouldn't be there.
871  Different how? Like—wait, are you worried you're gonna become one of those corner office people? Because um, hate to break it to you, but you're way too weird for that. In the best way.
872  Oh come on, it was just a joke! Everyone was laughing—I thought you'd think it was funny too. It's not like I was trying to—I dunno, make you look bad or whatever.
873  No, they were laughing with—okay, fine, maybe it came off wrong, but you gotta know I wasn't trying to embarrass you. I was literally just trying to lighten the mood. [scoff] You're acting like I planned this whole thing to hurt you.
874  I didn't—look look, I didn't realize it was gonna be that big of a deal, alright? You joke about that stuff all the time when it's just us, so I thought—I mean, how was I supposed to know you'd react like this?
875  Okay okay, yeah, there's a difference, but honestly? You could've just laughed it off instead of making it into this whole—now everyone probably thinks we're having some kinda drama. [frustrated laugh] That's way more awkward than the original joke.
876  That's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to explain that I didn't mean anything by it, and you're basically acting like I'm the worst friend in the world. Which is kinda unfair, don't you think?
877  It wasn't—it wasn't that private! You've told that story to like half the people there already. I just thought—I dunno, I thought it'd be funny coming from me. Obviously I was wrong, but [sigh] you're not even letting me apologize properly here.
878  Because you keep—fine, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry it came out wrong and I'm sorry you got embarrassed. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you think I'd ever intentionally humiliate you. Like, seriously? After everything?
879  No, but it should matter a little bit, shouldn't it? I mean, there's a difference between me being an idiot who misjudged a situation and me being—being some kinda terrible friend who wanted to hurt you. You know that's not who I am.
880  Wow. Okay. That's—if you really think that little of me after one stupid joke that went wrong, then maybe—I dunno what to tell you. I messed up, yeah, but you're being pretty harsh here.
881  Because I thought that was—[groan] fine, I won't make jokes about you in public anymore. Happy? Though honestly, if this is how you're gonna react every time I make a mistake, maybe we need to talk about more than just tonight.
883  [skeptical] Grandma, that's literally just a vegetable on my face. [laughing] How could that possibly cure anything? [more seriously] I already took ibuprofen, which has actual science behind it, not folklore from a hundred years ago.
884  [gently] I stopped crying because you were holding me and singing, not because of the egg. [Sigh] Correlation isn't causation, Abuela. [pleading] Can we please just stick to actual medicine when someone's sick?
885  [exasperated] He also took antibiotics from the hospital, remember? [slower pace] The onion tea didn't hurt, sure, but it wasn't what saved him. [Nervous laugh] Though I admit, your soup does make everyone feel better somehow.
886  [tired voice] She had a twenty-four hour bug that was already ending. [Quick breath] Abuela, I love you, but wearing garlic around my neck won't prevent flu. [amused] My coworkers already think I'm weird enough, honestly.
887  [conceding slightly] Okay, the eucalyptus steam does help with congestion—that one's legitimate. [more animated] But that's because menthol vapors actually open airways! [Soft groan] See? Some of your remedies have real reasons behind them.
888  [flatly] Holding my breath cures hiccups through diaphragm control, not magic. [getting louder] And nightmares aren't caused by sleeping with wet hair! [Defeated sigh] Though I do sleep better when you tuck that lavender sachet under my pillow.
889  [softening] I know these remedies mean a lot to you, and the history is beautiful. [hesitant] But when I have strep throat, I need penicillin, not honey and prayers. [quickly] Though your honey lemon tea is pretty soothing afterward.
890  [apologetically] Abuela, no, I don't think you're foolish at all. [tenderly] Your care and attention probably do more healing than any remedy. [with humor] But can we compromise? Medicine first, then your treatments for extra comfort?
891  [relieved] Deal! I'll try the ginger compress—ginger does have anti-inflammatory properties anyway. [teasing] But the red string stays under my sleeve at work. [warmly] And you have to admit when something needs real medical attention, okay?
892  [laughing warmly] My future kids will be the healthiest, most superstitious little scientists ever. [lovingly] They'll wear evil eye bracelets to their chemistry classes. [Contented sigh] Maybe that's the perfect balance—skepticism with just a pinch of magic.
893  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Davies. [measured tone] According to our incident report filed on October 12th, we've already initiated Protocol 5A which includes, um, mediation sessions between the students involved.
894  Physical assault is taken very seriously here. [concerned] However, our security footage from camera C-7 at timestamp 14:32:18 shows... well, it appears to be an accidental collision during class transition.
895  Cyberbullying falls under District Policy 8.7.2, which requires documentation. Have you filed the formal complaint form 22-A with our counseling office at extension 3451? We need proper channels followed, Mr. Davies.
896  I see she's maintaining a 3.8 GPA despite these challenges. What if we arrange a schedule change, moving her from Period 3 Chemistry, course code CHM-401, to Period 6 with Mr. Johnson instead?
897  Mr. Davies, I've scheduled a disciplinary hearing for November 15th at 9:00 AM. The superintendent, three board members, and our legal counsel from Suite 200 will review all evidence, including the twelve-page report I've compiled.
898  Our district provides free counseling services through Partnership Code MH-2023. Dr. Sarah Chen, licensed therapist, credential number 45778-CA, visits campus every Tuesday and Thursday. Should I schedule Emma for the 3:30 slot?
899  [carefully] Due to FERPA regulations, Section 99.31, I can't discuss another student's disciplinary status. However, I assure you that appropriate measures, documented in case file 2023-BUL-0847, are being implemented as we speak.
900  [seriously] Pattern behavior triggers automatic review under Statute 48900. [more confidentially] Between us, after incident number four, which would be yours, the district mandate requires immediate intervention including possible transfer to Westfield Alternative School, campus code WAS-7.
901  [warmly] Starting Monday, we'll have additional supervision at Junction Point B between buildings 200 and 300. Officer Martinez, badge number 7841, will specifically monitor that area during all transition periods, roughly 10:47 to 10:52 AM.
902  Absolutely, you'll receive comprehensive documentation by 5:00 PM tomorrow. Emma's wellbeing is our priority, Mr. Davies, and I'll personally call you at 555-0147 after Monday's intervention to, um, discuss progress. We'll get through this together.
903  [briskly] Let me check our system right away. Thornton's Classical Dynamics... I'm showing we had five copies, but they sold out yesterday morning. We can order it though—takes about three to four business days.
904  [calmly] I completely understand your frustration. [speaking faster] Listen, we actually have the second edition available for rental—it's mostly the same content. Or there's a digital version you can access immediately for about half the price.
905  The page numbers are different, yes, but—here's what I can do. We have a comparison guide that shows which chapters correspond. Most students manage fine with it, and you'd save about sixty dollars.
906  Rental's forty-five dollars for the semester. Normal highlighting and note-taking is totally fine—we expect that. Just no water damage or missing pages, and you're good.
907  I know, textbook ordering is... it's complicated with enrollment fluctuations. Professor Mitchell hasn't submitted next term's list yet, but if you keep your receipt, you can return it within two weeks of next semester if needed.
908  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, you're right again—what a surprise. [Tsk] I mean, how do you even fit through doorways with that massive brain of yours?
909  [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda think he's just making half this stuff up as he goes. [Chuckle]
910  [Fast] Actually, that's not—you know what, never mind, you're obviously the expert here. [Sigh] [Disappointed]
911  [Angry] Could you just let me finish one sentence without correcting me? [Groan] Like, seriously, just one?
912  [Happy] No no, please, tell me more about quantum physics while we're ordering coffee! [Laugh] [Sarcastic] I'm sure the barista's fascinated.
913  [Slow] So, um, when you say "actually," do you—do you practice that in the mirror or does it just come naturally? [Tsk]
914  [Shout] I GET IT! [Fast] You went to Yale, you've mentioned it literally seventeen times today!
915  [Sad] I used to really enjoy these conversations before they became, like, competitive lectures, y'know? [Sigh]
916  [Disappointed] Huh, that's funny 'cause I coulda sworn Wikipedia said something different when you were in the bathroom. [Chuckle] [Sarcastic]
917  [Whisper] [Fast] Quick question—is there literally any topic where you don't have a PhD-level opinion ready to go?
918  [Angry] You wanna know what I think? [Slow] Oh wait, that's right, you're gonna tell me what I think anyway. [Groan]
919  [Happy] My favorite part is when you pretend to consider my point for like half a second! [Laugh] [Sarcastic]
920  [Sad] [Slow] I guess I just—I dunno, I thought friends were supposed to listen to each other sometimes.
921  [Fast] Okay so basically you're saying everyone else at NASA is wrong and you've cracked the code from your living room? [Tsk] [Disappointed]
922  [Shout] [Angry] IT'S OKAY TO NOT KNOW SOMETHING! It's literally fine to just say "I don't know!"
923  [Whisper] Here we go again with the "well, technically" routine—I'm gonna need another drink for this. [Sigh] [Chuckle]
924  [Sarcastic] Wait wait wait, let me grab my notebook so I can document this rare moment of wisdom. [Slow] [Tsk]
925  [Happy] You know what, sure! [Fast] The earth is flat, vaccines are fake, and you invented the internet—anything else? [Laugh]
926  [Disappointed] I was actually excited to share this with you, but, um, I kinda forgot you turn everything into a TED talk. [Sigh]
927  [Angry] [Slow] Sometimes—and hear me out here—sometimes other people might actually have valid experiences too, yeah?
929  Wait wait wait—what worked? Oh my god, is this about the—the sourdough thing? Because I swear you've been trying for like, what, three weeks now?
930  Five—okay that's actually dedication though. I would've given up after like, day three? Maybe day two. [Laugh] So it's actually alive now? Like, legitimately alive?
931  That's—wait, isn't that kinda the point? I mean, fermentation is basically just controlled rot, right? Or—no that sounds wrong. But you know what I mean.
932  You named—oh my god, of course you did. Okay okay, I gotta know. What's—what's its name? Please tell me it's something ridiculous.
933  Brad. Your sourdough starter is named Brad. [Chuckle] That's so—I mean, honestly? That's perfect. Brad the bread. Wait, are you gonna make actual bread now?
934  If Brad—okay I love that you're talking about it like it's a moody teenager or something. Which, I guess after five weeks of trying to get it to work, kinda makes sense?
935  Are you—yes! Yes yes yes, obviously I want some! I've been hearing about this starter situation for literally over a month, I'm like, emotionally invested at this point.
936  Oh no no no, don't even—after all that work? It's gonna be amazing. And even if it's not, who cares? You made life! In a jar! That's—that's actually pretty wild when you think about it.
937  Just yeast? Babe, you've been babying this thing for five weeks straight. That's longer than most of my relationships. [Sigh] Brad is basically your child now.
938  I mean—yeah, okay, when I say it out loud like that it's kinda weird. But still! I'm really proud of you for sticking with it, y'know? Most people would've just bought bread.
939  I—okay, yes, but it's not like I had a choice. Everyone was gonna be there, and if I didn't invite them, it would've been this whole thing where people ask questions and—you know how our friends are.
940  I was gonna tell you! I mean, I tried to text you like three times but I kept deleting it because—[sigh]—because I knew you'd react exactly like this. And honestly? We're all adults here.
941  Then what is the point? Because from where I'm standing, you're asking me to basically pick sides in a breakup that happened months ago, and that's not—I can't do that. We're all in the same friend group.
942  Okay okay, fine, you're right about that part. I should've warned you. But also like—you can't expect everyone to just exclude Jamie forever. They're still part of our circle whether you like it or not.
943  That was—[frustrated laugh]—okay that was not supposed to be your birthday dinner. It literally just turned into that because everyone happened to be free and someone mentioned it was your birthday week, so I—yeah. I get why you're pissed about that specifically.
944  Yes, I do! But you're acting like I planned this whole ambush when really I'm just trying to keep everyone happy and—and maybe that's impossible, I dunno, but I'm not the villain here.
945  Wow. That's—that's really unfair. I've been there for you through this entire breakup, literally held your hair back when you got wasted crying about them, and now I'm a shitty friend because I didn't wanna create drama? Come on.
946  Because you're creating it! Jamie was fine, you were fine until you saw each other, and then suddenly—look, I'm sorry it was awkward, okay? But maybe, just maybe, you need to figure out how to exist in the same space sometimes.
947  I'm not—I'm not making any calls! I'm literally just trying to have a normal friend group where people can hang out without it being this huge political thing every single time. [scoff] But apparently that makes me the bad guy.
948  Fine. Take your space. But just so we're clear—I'm not gonna apologize for staying friends with both of you. That's not fair to ask, and deep down? You know it's not.
949  That's not—I never said that. I was just trying to, y'know, help you see things from a different angle. Like, isn't that what friends are supposed to do?
950  Okay okay, when you put it like that it sounds—[sigh] but that's not what I meant. I was literally just trying to help you feel better about the situation.
951  Well, I'm sorry, but I don't know what else to—I mean, you come to me with these things and I'm supposed to what, just agree that everything's terrible? That's not who I am.
952  But that's—that's the thing though, you always say that, but then you keep talking about it like you want advice. It's kinda confusing, honestly. [frustrated laugh] I can't read your mind.
953  Oh come on, that's not fair. I do care—I wouldn't spend hours trying to help if I didn't care. You're making it sound like I'm some heartless person who just dismisses everything you say.
954  What? No no no, that's—you're completely twisting what I said. I was talking about how my cousin bounced back from getting laid off, not—Jesus, you're really gonna make me the bad guy here?
955  Yeah, you kinda are though. Like, I get that you're upset, and maybe I didn't—[groan] maybe I could've been more sensitive or whatever, but you're acting like I did this on purpose.
956  Every time? Seriously? That's—okay, if that's really how you feel, then why do you even talk to me about stuff? I mean, I'm obviously terrible at this, right?
957  Wow. Okay. So we're—we're really going there. Look, I'm sorry if my way of trying to help isn't what you need, but I'm not gonna apologize for actually trying, y'know?
958  Fine? That's it? [scoff] You know what, maybe—maybe we both need to figure out what we actually want from each other here, because this isn't working for either of us.
960  [nervously] I'm actually trying to be good tonight. [quieter] Just a salad for me, please. [Deep breath] My doctor says I need to watch my cholesterol, and I've already lost five pounds this month.
961  [firmly] That sounds amazing, but I'm sticking to my plan. [softer] Maybe just some grilled chicken with the salad? [Nervous laugh] I've been doing so well lately, I don't want to slip up now.
962  [Uncomfortable chuckle] You're not a glutton. [more defensive] I just need to stay focused on my goals right now. [wavering] Maybe I could have one piece of bread? [quickly] No, no, I shouldn't even start.
963  [hurt] It's not like that. [steadier] I'm trying to be healthier, not punish myself. [Soft exhale] My energy levels are better, I sleep better—[brightening slightly] I even ran a 5K last weekend without stopping!
964  [laughing] That's not how nutrition works! [more serious] Look, I appreciate you wanting to include me. [gentle] Why don't you get what you want, and [hopeful voice] I'll steal a bite of your dessert later?
965  [exasperated] One bite doesn't mean I'm abandoning everything. [calmer] It's about balance, not deprivation. [Thoughtful hum] Actually, having a taste might stop me from binging later when I'm home alone with my cravings.
966  [quietly] Of course I miss them. [more emotional] I miss not thinking about every calorie too. [Shaky breath] But I also missed fitting into my clothes and [stronger] feeling confident at the beach last summer.
967  [surprised] What? [warmly] Food isn't our only connection! [reassuring] We're here together, aren't we? [Chuckle] Besides, I can still appreciate your food stories—[playful] I just experience them vicariously through you now!
968  [amused] See? This is perfect! [cheerful] You eat, you describe every flavor in detail. [Giggle] I'll live through your taste buds while [contentedly] enjoying my grilled chicken, which honestly sounds pretty good right now.
969  [fake stern] You're terrible! [laughing harder] This is exactly why I needed dinner accountability—[grateful tone] but also why I love having meals with you. [tenderly] Thanks for understanding, even when you're being a total enabler.
970  Welcome to TechConnect! Don't worry, we'll get you sorted out right away. Let me show you our three main plans—we've got Basic at $35, Premium at $65, and Ultimate at $95 per month.
971  She might have our Basic plan with a loyalty discount! After 12 months, customers get 15% off their base rate. Plus, if you port your number—do you know your current number?
972  The Premium plan includes unlimited talk, text, and 50GB of high-speed data. [more excitedly] You also get free international texting to 180 countries! Would you like me to check if promotional code SAVE25 still applies?
973  Yes, 50 gigabytes! Great news—SAVE25 is active through December 31st, bringing Premium down to $48.75. I'll need your driver's license number to run a credit check, whenever you're ready.
974  Basic includes Canada and Mexico calling only, I'm afraid. [more optimistically] However, you could add International Plus for $12 monthly—that covers 75 countries including Czech Republic! Should I calculate that option for you?
975  No contracts required on any plan! [more enthusiastically] You can change or cancel anytime with 30 days notice. I can also set up autopay with routing number 021000021 for an extra $5 discount.
976  Exactly $48.75 with code SAVE25! I'll need to verify your email for account setup. Also, would you like to keep your current number or get a new local one?
977  Service activates within 2-4 hours after setup! Your first bill dated January 15th will include a $35 activation fee. Should I email confirmation to that jadams address?
978  [apologetically] Yes, the activation is standard, sorry about that! I'll waive shipping on your SIM—normally $9.99—since you're signing up today. Can you confirm ZIP code 94102 for delivery?
979  Moving is always overwhelming! But you're all set now—order number TM-8847-QZ confirmed. Your SIM arrives in 2-3 business days, and our support line 1-800-TECH is always here if you need help!
980  Good afternoon, how can I help you today? [cheerfully] I see you were in last week for the, uh, transmission service.
981  I understand your frustration, sir. [quickly] Let me pull up your service record here and—oh, I see we did the full flush and filter replacement. The grinding is still happening?
982  Well, the symptoms you described last week did indicate transmission issues. But if it's happening during braking, that's—that's definitely different. [quickly] We can take another look, no charge for the diagnostic.
983  Sir, I assure you we diagnosed based on the information provided. However, we do stand behind our work, so let's—let's get this resolved today. Can you bring it in this afternoon?
984  [nervously] That would be, um, Jake, but he's off today. Look, I can personally guarantee we'll make this right—if it's the brakes, we'll credit the labor from last week toward the repair. [hopeful] Fair enough?
985  Absolutely, everything documented. I'll prep the paperwork now and have our senior tech, Marcus, look at it—he's got thirty years experience. We'll find the real issue.
986  Perfect, three o'clock works great. And sir, just so you know, if Marcus finds it was our error, we'll also throw in a free oil change for the inconvenience.
987  I really do understand your frustration. These things shouldn't happen, and we'll—we'll definitely review our diagnostic procedures after this. Thank you for giving us another chance.
988  We absolutely will, sir. Marcus will personally test drive it himself before and after any work. Your family's safety is our priority.
989  Cars can be frustrating when multiple things go wrong. But we'll get to the bottom of it today, I promise. See you at three, Mr. Davidson.
990  [Slow] I don't even know what day it is anymore—Tuesday? [Groan] My brain feels like it's, uh, floating in soup or something.
991  [Angry] [Fast] Why is everyone being so loud when it's clearly the middle of the night—oh wait, it's noon, never mind.
992  [Happy] You know what, I'm actually kinda enjoying this weird twilight zone thing where breakfast feels like dinner! [Chuckle]
993  [Whisper] Is it just me or does the ceiling look really, really far away right now? [Sigh]
994  [Disappointed] I literally set seventeen alarms and still somehow missed the—wait, did I sleep through all of them? [Tsk]
995  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's schedule a meeting for 8 AM, that's perfect when my body thinks it's midnight. [Groan]
996  [Sad] [Slow] I just wanna sleep but my stupid brain won't, um, won't turn off, you know?
997  [Fast] Coffee isn't working, melatonin isn't working, I've tried everything and I'm still—ugh, forget it. [Angry] [Groan]
998  [Chuckle] Did I seriously just put toothpaste on my hairbrush? [Happy] This is getting ridiculous, honestly.
999  [Shout] Don't talk to me until I figure out what timezone my stomach is in! [Angry]
1000  [Slow] [Disappointed] The worst part is, like, knowing you're gonna crash hard in about three hours but there's nothing you can—yeah.
1001  [Whisper] [Sad] Everyone else is asleep and I'm just here, staring at the wall like some kind of, I dunno, zombie.
1002  [Sarcastic] My body's in New York but apparently my soul is still somewhere over the Pacific. [Tsk] [Sigh]
1003  [Fast] [Happy] Actually, being awake at 4 AM means no traffic, no lines at the store—it's kinda great!
1004  [Groan] Why does water taste weird when you're jet lagged, or is that just—am I imagining things now?
1005  [Angry] I've been home for three days and my sleep schedule is still completely—[Shout] this is insane!
1006  [Slow] You ever feel like your eyeballs are, um, vibrating? [Disappointed] Because that's where I'm at right now.
1007  [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] Yeah, let me just "power through" like everyone keeps suggesting—that's definitely how biology works.
1008  [Sad] I keep forgetting simple words and it's really—what's the word—frustrating, that's it. [Tsk]
1009  [Happy] [Fast] Okay but silver lining: I get to eat dinner twice today and nobody can judge me for it!
1011  Wait wait wait—what? You hit—oh my god, are you serious right now? That's like, that's incredible! How do you feel? I mean—wow, I'm actually getting emotional about this [Laugh]
1012  No no, I totally get that. It's gotta be like—I mean, you've been working at this for what, almost a year? That's a huge change, y'know?
1013  Eleven months of just—okay, the dedication though. Like, I watched you meal prep every Sunday, turn down pizza nights, get up at ungodly hours to work out... honestly? You're kinda my hero right now.
1014  Um, excuse me? No—that's literally the hardest part! Showing up every single day when you don't wanna? That's the whole thing! [Sigh] Don't downplay this.
1015  Stop it. The ones from—wait, the dark wash ones you kept in the back of your closet? Those are like, what, fifteen years old?
1016  That's—I'm sorry, loose? They're loose now? Okay okay, we're definitely celebrating. I don't care what you say, we're doing something special.
1017  It's not a fuss, it's—look, you literally just accomplished something most people never do. Like, ninety-whatever percent of diets fail, right? And you just... didn't. [Chuckle]
1018  Oh god, the plateau week. You were so—yeah, you were ready to throw your scale out the window. But you didn't quit, and that's what I'm saying!
1019  I mean, I just—aw, stop. I basically just rambled at you while you nodded politely. But honestly? Watching you push through was kinda inspiring for me too, y'know?
1020  Okay now you're gonna make me cry for real. Come here—actually no, we're getting drinks. Skinny margaritas or whatever you want, but we're toasting to this tonight.
1022  [scrutinizing] Oh honey, that one's not going to work. [sharper] The cut-up sides will just emphasize your hips, and [Tsk] we both know you need more coverage there. Maybe try something with a little skirt attached?
1023  [fake sweetness] Of course you can, sweetheart! [patronizing] I'm just trying to help you look your best. [Sigh] When I was your age, I could wear anything, but bodies change differently for everyone, don't they?
1024  [wounded] I'm only thinking of your confidence at the beach! [whimpering] You know how cruel people can be. [more insistent] That black one-piece over there would be so slimming and elegant on you.
1025  [Gasp] Red? [horrified whisper] Darling, bright colors draw attention to problem areas. [pleading voice] At least consider navy or black—they're so much more flattering and sophisticated for fuller figures.
1026  [flustered] That's not what I meant at all! [higher pitch] I just want you to be happy and feel beautiful. [manipulative softness] You used to trust my fashion advice when you were younger, remember?
1027  [defensive shriek] How dare you make me the villain! [trembling] Every mother wants their daughter to be healthy and attractive. [Sniffling] I've only ever wanted the best for you, even if you can't see it.
1028  [coldly] Fine, buy whatever you want. [clipped words] But don't come crying to me when the beach photos surface on Facebook. [bitter tone] Your cousin Sarah just lost twenty pounds—she looks absolutely fantastic now.
1029  [huffing] Impossible approval? [getting louder] I complimented your hair just this morning! [accusatory] You only focus on the negative things I say, never the positive encouragement I try to give you.
1030  [fake hurt] I suppose I'm just a terrible mother then. [dramatic whisper] All those years of caring for you, and this is the thanks I get. [building intensity] Maybe I should just keep my opinions to myself.
1031  [sulking] If that's what you really want. [passive-aggressive sweetness] But when you're wondering why something doesn't look quite right in photos, [trailing off] don't say I didn't try to warn you, darling.
1032  [apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Chen. [calmly] According to our system, your account ID 4589-JKL shows the submission deadline was actually March 15th for the 2023 plan year.
1033  Let me pull that up for you. [carefully] Ah, I see the confusion—the extension code you mentioned applies only to dependent care expenses, not medical FSA claims.
1034  I completely understand this is disappointing. Unfortunately, the IRS regulations for plan year 2023, section 125-C, don't allow us to make exceptions after the run-out period ends.
1035  I truly wish I could help with that, but backdating would violate federal compliance rules. However, let me check if any of your receipts qualify for the current 2024 plan year.
1036  Actually, that January 12th receipt would fall under your 2024 plan! If you can resubmit it with form FSA-2024-B before June 30th, we can process that $147.23 charge.
1037  December 29th would have been part of the 2023 plan year, unfortunately. [explaining patiently] The cutoff is based on service date, not payment date, according to regulation 213-D in your benefits handbook.
1038  I know this feels unfair, and I'm genuinely sorry. Would you like me to email you at jchen@techcorp.com a detailed breakdown of what can still be claimed?
1039  [apologetically] I see that error in your file from February, case number SUP-2024-1123. I've updated your correct address and will personally ensure this email reaches you within the hour.
1040  [positively] Perfect, that January 8th charge definitely qualifies! I'm adding reference number NEW-CLAIM-5643 to track it, and you should receive reimbursement within 7-10 business days.
1041  Absolutely, Mr. Chen, those January expenses are secure. I've noted everything in ticket FSA-HELP-9987, and I'll personally monitor your account to ensure smooth processing.
1042  Good afternoon, ticket support, how can I help you today? I see you're calling about a transfer issue—let me pull up your account real quick.
1043  I understand your frustration, let me check that for you. [typing rapidly] Hmm, I'm seeing here that... wait, did you verify your email through the confirmation link we sent?
1044  Right, I see the issue now—there's a hold on your account. [more quickly] Sometimes this happens when multiple transfer attempts are made within, um, a short timeframe. I can override this manually for you.
1045  Okay, I'm releasing the hold now, should just take a moment. While we wait, can you confirm the recipient's email? Make sure it's spelled exactly right, even one letter off will bounce it back.
1046  Perfect, and... there we go! [triumphantly] The transfer just went through on my end. Your friend should receive an email within the next five to ten minutes with her ticket access.
1047  Oh no, definitely don't do that—screenshots won't scan at the gate! But you're all set now. [helpfully] Tell your friend to add the ticket to her digital wallet once she gets it.
1048  Oh that's just standard language for transferred tickets, nothing to worry about. Once a ticket's transferred, the new holder can't request refunds directly—but the tickets themselves are exactly the same.
1049  This time it's different—I pushed it through manually. [enthusiastically] In fact, let me just... yep, I can see it's already been delivered to her inbox!
1050  [pleased] Excellent, glad we could sort that out for you! Is there anything else I can help you with regarding tomorrow's show? Parking passes, venue information, anything like that?
1051  They stopped requiring those last month actually. Just bring your ID and your ticket, that's all you need. Doors open at seven, but I'd suggest arriving by six-thirty if you want decent merch selection.
1052  [Disappointed] Look, I just—I don't have that, um, that maternal instinct everyone talks about, you know? [Sigh] It's not there.
1053  [Happy] Honestly, I love my freedom too much! [Laugh] Like, I can just pack up and go to Thailand tomorrow if I want.
1054  [Fast] People keep saying "you'll change your mind" but I'm thirty-five and still waiting for this magical transformation, so... [Sarcastic] [Tsk]
1055  [Angry] Why does everyone act like I'm—like I'm broken or something just because I don't wanna reproduce? [Groan]
1056  [Slow] The planet's kinda, uh, dying? [Sad] And bringing a kid into this mess feels... I dunno, cruel maybe.
1057  [Whisper] Between you and me, I can barely take care of myself most days. [Chuckle] A tiny human would be a disaster.
1058  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just give up my career I worked fifteen years for to, what, watch Bluey all day? [Disappointed]
1059  [Happy] My sister has three kids and honestly—wait, don't tell her this—but it looks absolutely exhausting. [Fast] [Laugh]
1060  [Shout] It's my body! [Angry] I get to decide what happens with it, right?
1061  [Sad] I grew up in a really messed up family and I'm just—I'm terrified I'd repeat those patterns, y'know? [Sigh]
1062  [Slow] Have you seen how much college costs now? [Disappointed] [Groan] It's like a quarter million dollars or something insane.
1063  [Fast] Okay so basically my friend just had a baby and she literally hasn't slept in—what, three months? [Whisper] She looks dead inside.
1064  [Happy] I mean, I've got twelve houseplants and I've killed, um, probably half of them, so... [Chuckle] [Tsk]
1065  [Sarcastic] Yeah, 'cause what I really need is someone screaming at 3 AM when I finally got my insomnia under control. [Angry]
1066  [Disappointed] The thing is—actually, you know what? [Slow] I just don't want them, and that should be enough of a reason.
1067  [Sad] My partner and I, we're—we're not even sure we'll make it, honestly. [Sigh] Adding a kid would be... yeah.
1068  [Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too selfish for it, but then I think—wait, isn't that self-aware at least? [Fast]
1069  [Shout] Can we please stop pretending pregnancy is beautiful? [Angry] [Groan] It literally rearranges your organs!
1070  [Happy] I've got, like, seventeen godchildren already, okay? [Laugh] I get to spoil them and send them home—it's perfect!
1071  [Slow] You wanna know the real reason? [Sad] I'm scared I'd love them so much it would break me, and I can't—I just can't risk that.
1073  I know, I know—I'm so sorry. I just, I completely froze up when your ex started talking about the breakup and I didn't—I should've jumped in, I know that.
1074  Oh god, was it really three minutes? It felt like—okay no, you're right, it was forever. I kept trying to think of something to say but my brain just [nervous laugh] completely shut down, y'know?
1075  I did! I mean—I do! I always have your back, I swear, but when he started going into all those details I just—I panicked. Like, literally couldn't form words. Which is ironic because usually I can't shut up, right?
1076  Wait wait wait, don't—please don't be like this. I'm trying to—I wanna explain but I know how badly I messed up. Everyone was just staring and I felt like if I said something it might make it worse? But that's—that's not an excuse.
1077  You're right. You're totally right. I should've just, I dunno, spilled my drink or pretended to choke or literally anything other than standing there like an idiot while you were drowning.
1078  I actually—okay this is gonna sound so stupid but I kept thinking about faking a phone call? But then I was like, what if it's too obvious, and then—ugh, I just overthought everything instead of actually helping. [groan] I'm the worst friend ever.
1079  That's somehow worse? Like, honestly, I'd rather be the worst than disappointing. I just—I keep replaying it in my head and thinking of all the things I should've said or done and I can't—I can't stop kicking myself for it.
1080  Oh no. Oh no no no, I didn't—I didn't know you cried. That makes me feel even more terrible, if that's possible. I should've followed you, or—wait, did you want me to follow you?
1081  You're right. You're absolutely right and I—there's no excuse. I failed you when you needed me most and that's just... that's not okay. I'm gonna—I'm gonna do better, I promise. Like, we can practice scenarios or have a code word or something?
1082  Yeah. Yes. Definitely no freezing. And hey, if he ever tries to corner you again, I'll—I'll literally throw myself between you two if I have to. [softer] I really am sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply sorry. You deserved better from me.
1083  I know, I know, okay? My phone died and I—look, I completely spaced it. But it's not like I did it on purpose, I had like a million things going on today.
1084  Don't—don't do that. You're acting like I'm making excuses but I literally had my mom's doctor appointment, then work called me in early, and yeah, I forgot to charge my phone. [Sigh] I'm human, okay?
1085  Wait, what? You didn't—you didn't tell me it was for an interview! You just said you needed a ride downtown, how was I supposed to know it was that important?
1086  Are you seriously—yes! Yes, it would've mattered! I would've like, set three alarms or something. You can't just [frustrated laugh] expect me to read your mind about what's important and what's not.
1087  That's not—okay okay, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying if you'd actually communicated with me instead of just assuming I'd remember every single thing, maybe—maybe this wouldn't have happened.
1088  I write everything down! I've got like—my whole calendar is full, and sometimes things just... slip through. I'm not perfect, alright? And honestly, you're kinda being unfair here.
1089  Yeah! Yeah, you are! You're sitting here acting like I'm the worst friend in the world when—when have I ever let you down before this? Name one time. [Scoff] But no, one mistake and suddenly I'm unreliable.
1090  I didn't—ugh, I didn't mean to leave you stranded! That's the whole point! My phone was dead, I couldn't even call you when I realized. What was I supposed to do, drive around the entire city looking for you?
1091  Okay fine, fine, you're right. I should've remembered. But I'm not gonna stand here and—and grovel when you won't even acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, shit happens sometimes and it's not about you.
1092  I'll—look, I'll pay you back for the Uber, obviously. But I'm not gonna apologize for being human. And if you wanna stay mad about this forever, then I guess—I dunno what else to tell you.
1093  I—yeah, okay, I did, but Jake specifically asked me not to tell anyone. Like, he made me promise, and I couldn't just—you know I couldn't break that.
1094  That's not—come on, that's not what I meant. You know that's not what I meant. But he was really messed up about it and he needed someone to just... listen without it becoming this whole thing.
1095  No! God, no, that's—[frustrated laugh] you're twisting my words. I'm saying he was in a bad place and he trusted me with something personal. What was I supposed to do, immediately run to you?
1096  Okay okay, but this wasn't my secret to tell! It was Jake's thing, his—his whole situation with his dad, and honestly? I'm kinda frustrated that you can't see why I had to respect that.
1097  That's—ugh, that's so unfair. You're making this about you when it literally had nothing to do with you. I wasn't keeping it from you to hurt you, I was keeping it because someone asked me to. There's a difference.
1098  Yes! Obviously there is! Look look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but you're acting like I—like I chose him over you or something, which is not what happened. [Sigh] At all.
1099  I didn't lie! I just... didn't tell you one thing. One thing out of, what, hundreds? Thousands? And now you're gonna throw away our entire friendship because I kept one promise to someone else?
1100  Yeah, and it sucked! It really really sucked, okay? But I was stuck between—between two people I care about, and I made a call. Maybe it was wrong, I dunno, but I'm not gonna apologize for trying to be a good friend to someone who needed it.
1101  I—that's... [scoff] I am constantly a good friend to you. Constantly. And the one time, the one time I have to put someone else's trust first, you're ready to just... what, end this?
1102  Well that's—that's great. Really great. Y'know, I thought you'd at least try to understand, but apparently keeping one promise makes me the worst friend ever. Fine. Whatever.
1103  Okay, I know it didn't go how we—how I thought it would, but you gotta believe me, I really thought you two would hit it off. Like, on paper, you're perfect for each other.
1104  Don't—don't do that. You know what I mean. You both love hiking, you're both into those weird documentaries, you literally have the same sense of humor. I wasn't just throwing you at some random person.
1105  I didn't—[groan] I didn't know they were still hung up on them, okay? Last time we talked, they said they were totally over it. Like, completely done. How was I supposed to know they were lying?
1106  That's not—come on, that's not fair. I've known them for like three years. They seemed ready, they told me they wanted to meet someone new. I mean, they literally asked if I knew anyone.
1107  No! God, no, that's not what—you're twisting this. I genuinely, honestly thought you'd be good together. [frustrated laugh] I'm sorry it sucked, I am, but I wasn't trying to use you as some kind of test dummy.
1108  Okay okay, I get that you're pissed, but you're acting like I deliberately sabotaged you or something. I was trying to help. Maybe I should've—I dunno, vetted them better or whatever, but my intentions were good.
1109  And that sucks! It does, I'm not saying it doesn't. But like—ugh, you know what? You could've left. You could've texted me for an out, you could've just walked away, but you didn't.
1110  For my—[scoff] okay, so now I'm responsible for you being too nice to leave a bad date? That's on me too? Come on.
1111  Because I thought—I still think they're a good person, they're just... obviously not ready. And yeah, I missed that, fine fine, I screwed up there. But I wasn't being malicious about it.
1112  That's—wow. Okay. If that's how you wanna be about it. I try to do something nice, it goes badly, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever. Real proportionate response there.
1113  Wait wait wait—you matched? Like, THE match? Oh my god, did you—did you get your results already?
1114  HOPKINS? Are you—[Gasp] that's your number one! That's literally your dream program! Oh my god, I'm gonna cry, I'm actually gonna cry right now.
1115  Processing? Babe, you just got into like, the best neuro program in the country! This is—this is everything you've been working for since, what, sophomore year?
1116  Twelve? You've wanted this since you were twelve? That's—okay that's making me even more emotional. Did you tell your parents yet? They're gonna absolutely lose it.
1117  No no no, it's real, it's definitely real! You—I mean, you logged in yourself, right? You saw it with your own eyes?
1118  [Laugh] Of course you do. That's so—that's so you. But like, honestly? After everything you've done—all those insane hours, the research, that brutal attending who made you cry that one time—you earned this.
1119  Okay, um, excuse me? You literally just survived med school while publishing two papers and somehow still remembered my birthday every year. You're gonna—you're gonna crush this.
1120  Yeah, it's... it's far. [Sigh] But like, we'll visit! And honestly? Baltimore's kinda cool now, apparently. My cousin lives there and she's always posting these cute coffee shops and stuff.
1121  Are you kidding? Obviously I'm visiting! I'm already planning like—okay wait, when do you start? July? I'm literally gonna help you move and everything.
1122  Stop, you're gonna make me cry again. But seriously though—Dr. Future Neurologist at Johns Hopkins? That's... that's who you are now. How completely insane is that?
1124  [breathlessly] Don't say that! [higher pitched] We studied together every single day, remember? [Nervous laugh] Okay, okay, let's count to three and open them at the exact same time. My heart is beating so fast I might actually pass out.
1125  [frantically] Are you insane? [slower, trembling] If I passed and you didn't, I'd feel horrible. [Gasp] Let's just rip off the band-aid together. Put your finger on your screen. Ready? Here we go—clicking now!
1126  [stunned whisper] Mine says... [explosive joy] PASS! WE'RE LAWYERS! [Shrieking laugh] We actually did it! Remember when we thought we'd never understand constitutional law? And now look at us—actual attorneys! This is insane!
1127  [giddy] Let them wait! [more seriously] This moment is ours first. [Whooping] We survived the worst exam known to mankind! Remember day two when we both cried in the parking lot? Worth every tear now!
1128  [emotionally] Six years of friendship, three years of study groups. [choking up] We dreamed about this day so many times. [Soft laugh] Now we need to plan the biggest celebration party in history. Champagne is definitely not enough!
1129  [in disbelief] I keep refreshing to make sure it's real. [more confidently] It still says pass! [Cackling] Remember Professor Williams who said we asked too many questions? Bet those questions helped us pass this beast!
1130  [philosophically] You know what's crazy? [building excitement] Yesterday we were just law graduates, today we're actual lawyers! [Breathless laugh] The imposter syndrome is hitting hard, but who cares—we earned this title fair and square!
1131  [solemnly] I promise. [brightening up] We should take a screenshot of these results immediately! [Giggling] Future us will need proof that this happiness existed. Also, should we update LinkedIn now or wait until tomorrow?
1132  [mockingly formal] "I am humbled to share..." [breaking character, laughing] Who are we kidding? [Enthusiastically] I'm posting "I'M A LAWYER" in all caps with fifty exclamation points! Humble can wait until tomorrow!
1133  [warmly] Thank you for going through this with me. [getting emotional] Having a study partner who became family made everything bearable. [Happy sigh] Now let's go get those drinks we've been promising ourselves since day one of bar prep!
1134  I do apologize for the inconvenience, sir. [calmly] Let me pull up your reservation—could you please verify the email address on file? We'll definitely get this sorted out for you today.
1135  I can see those previous interactions here, Mr. Morrison. Your flight from JFK to LAX on March 15th was indeed cancelled. Um, it appears there was a processing error with code E-447 on your account.
1136  [patiently] The E-447 indicates a payment verification issue, sir. I'll need to transfer you to our billing department at extension 8823. They can override this and process your refund immediately, within 24 hours actually.
1137  [understanding] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Morrison. Let me try something different—I'm escalating this to supervisor code S-99A right now. My badge number is 6674, and I'm personally flagging this for priority processing.
1138  Absolutely, your new reference number is RF-20240315-AAB9. [clearly] I'm sending a text confirmation now to 555-0147, and [helpfully] you'll receive an email within 4 hours showing the refund pending to your card ending in... let me confirm, 7782?
1139  Let me update that immediately—7728, correct. Actually, this might be why the previous attempts failed. The system shows your refund can now process to the correct card within 2-3 business days maximum.
1140  [professionally] Our escalation line is 1-800-555-9900, ask for Team Lead Jennifer Martinez. But Mr. Morrison, I've added priority flag P-1 to your case. You should see the full $847.50 by Friday at the latest.
1141  [assuringly] The text is being sent as we speak, sir. [helpful] It'll include your reference number, my badge ID, and the expected refund date. I truly apologize for all the trouble you've experienced with this.
1142  Pending approval is just our standard verification process, takes about 2 hours. Since it's marked P-1 priority, it bypasses the regular queue. [confidently] By 5:30 PM today, you'll get another text saying "approved for processing."
1143  [understanding] I've documented everything in your file, Mr. Morrison, including today's corrections. My shift ends at 6 PM, but I'm personally monitoring your case. Thank you for your patience, and again, reference RF-20240315-AAB9 for any follow-up.
1144  Good afternoon, Appliance World, this is Sarah speaking. How can I help you today—do you have an order number I can look up for you?
1145  Let me just... pull that up for you right away. Oh, I see here it's showing as backordered. Unfortunately the manufacturer has delayed shipment.
1146  I understand your frustration, absolutely, and you're right—someone should have contacted you. [more firmly] Let me check our inventory system to see if we have any alternatives in stock.
1147  [hesitantly] The system shows... well, it's indicating another two to three weeks. [hurriedly] But wait, I can escalate this to our priority fulfillment team, they sometimes have access to different stock.
1148  Of course, let me get my supervisor right away. Before I do though, I can offer you fifteen percent off for the inconvenience, plus free installation when it arrives.
1149  Absolutely, I'll email you the confirmation right now while you hold. My manager Jennifer will be with you in just a moment—she has more authority to expedite orders.
1150  You're absolutely right, that's our policy. I'm seeing a note here that... hmm, the automated system flagged an incorrect phone number. Though we should have emailed regardless.
1151  She can go up to twenty-five percent, sometimes thirty for situations like this. Plus she has direct contacts at the warehouse who might locate your specific model faster.
1152  I completely understand, these timeline disruptions cascade into everything else. [more quickly] Jennifer's just finishing another call—she'll be about thirty more seconds, and I promise she'll make this right.
1153  Please don't cancel just yet—Jennifer can actually match competitor timelines in many cases. She has override codes for express shipping that I don't have access to. [hopefully] Just give her two minutes?
1154  [Disappointed] Look, I wanted to go, I really did, but when Dad got sick, someone had to—someone had to take over the shop. [Sigh]
1155  [Fast] [Happy] Honestly, best decision I ever made because I started my business at eighteen and now I'm doing better than, like, all my friends with degrees!
1156  [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just pull forty thousand dollars out of thin air for tuition. [Tsk] That would've been nice.
1157  [Slow] I guess I just... I dunno, I never really saw myself as the academic type, you know? [Shrug]
1158  [Angry] [Shout] Why does everyone assume you're a failure if you don't have a degree? I'm doing FINE!
1159  [Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified of leaving home—like, absolutely terrified. [Sad]
1160  [Chuckle] My guidance counselor literally told me I wasn't "college material," so, uh, yeah, that kinda killed my confidence right there.
1161  [Fast] [Disappointed] I had a full scholarship lined up but then Mom—she needed help with the twins and I couldn't just leave her.
1162  [Happy] [Laugh] Dude, I went straight into coding bootcamp for three months and got hired immediately—why would I waste four years?
1163  [Slow] [Sad] The acceptance letter came the same week as the diagnosis, and suddenly college just... it didn't matter anymore.
1164  [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, because sitting in a classroom learning theory while my friends were out there actually doing stuff seemed super appealing.
1165  Trade school made way more sense—I mean, plumbers make bank and nobody talks about that, right? [Chuckle]
1166  [Angry] I'm so tired of explaining this to people like it's some kind of—like I failed at life or something. [Groan]
1167  [Whisper] [Disappointed] I actually got into my dream school but, um, the financial aid fell through last minute.
1168  [Happy] Military gave me everything college would've, plus they paid ME to learn, so honestly, no regrets there! [Laugh]
1169  [Slow] You wanna know the truth? [Sad] [Sigh] I just wasn't ready—mentally, emotionally, none of it.
1170  [Fast] [Sarcastic] Oh, I'm sorry, should I have gone into massive debt to get a degree in something I'd probably hate anyway?
1171  [Disappointed] [Slow] My anxiety was so bad senior year that I couldn't even—I couldn't imagine leaving town, let alone going to college.
1172  [Shout] [Happy] I got discovered at seventeen and went straight to touring—college can wait, but that opportunity couldn't!
1173  [Groan] [Angry] Every family dinner it's the same question, and I'm just—I'm done justifying my life choices to everyone, okay?
1175  Oh god, okay—I can explain! It wasn't—I mean, they were asking about you and I thought maybe you'd be interested? Like, they seemed really nice and I just—I dunno, I thought I was helping.
1176  No no no, you're right, that sounds—that sounds terrible when you say it like that. I wasn't thinking about it as personal information, y'know? Just your number. But that's—[groan] that's literally what personal information is. I'm an idiot.
1177  I'm sorry. I really—I should've asked you first. Obviously. Like that's just basic respect and I completely ignored it because I got excited about playing matchmaker or whatever. Which is so stupid.
1178  Oh no. Oh no no no, they called you already? I told them—wait, actually I didn't tell them anything about when to call. [nervous laugh] God, I really didn't think this through at all, did I? I'm so sorry.
1179  Shit. I mean—shit. That's... yeah. I can um, I can talk to them? Tell them to back off? I know that doesn't fix what I did but maybe it'll help? I dunno, I'm just—I'm trying to think of something here.
1180  Right. Right, of course. I won't—I won't do anything else without asking you. Promise. I just... I feel terrible about this, honestly. Like you trusted me with your number and I just handed it out like it was nothing.
1181  I know. I mean—I know that now. I should've known it before. You're really private about stuff and I just completely steamrolled over that because I thought—doesn't matter what I thought. [sigh] I messed up bad.
1182  Because I'm—okay this is gonna sound dumb but I was worried you'd say no? And I thought Alex was perfect for you and I wanted to surprise you with this great thing but instead I just... violated your trust. Basically.
1183  Yeah. Yeah, when you—when you put it like that it sounds really, really bad. Because it is. It is bad. I basically decided I knew better than you about your own life which is so messed up. I'm really, truly sorry. I don't—I don't know how to make you believe me but I am.
1184  Yes. Absolutely. I will, I promise. And there's gonna—I mean, I'm gonna work really hard to make sure there is a next time? That you'll still wanna be friends with me after this. Because I know I screwed up but you're—you're really important to me and I promise I'll do better.
1185  Wait wait wait—the Whitmore? As in like, the one where they literally have security checking net worth at the door? That's—oh my god, that's huge!
1186  Okay so you're gonna need—I mean, we're gonna need to get you something absolutely stunning. Like, this is not a rent-the-runway situation, y'know? This is like... this is the real deal. [Gasp] Do you have a plus one?
1187  Um, hello? Are you—are you actually sitting there pretending like I'm not literally right here begging with my eyes? Because I will, I will absolutely beg out loud if that's what you need.
1188  Okay okay, yes, but like—that was before I knew we could go judge everyone together! Plus honestly? The champagne is probably worth more than my car payment, so... [Laugh] priorities, right?
1189  Oh no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. You know exactly why. That project you did? The one that basically saved their entire—what was it, their sustainability initiative? They'd be idiots not to invite you.
1190  Just data—babe, you literally restructured their entire carbon offset program! In like, what, three weeks? That's not "just" anything, that's... that's genius-level stuff.
1191  Okay first of all, nobody actually knows which fork is which—they're all just pretending, trust me. And second, you're like... you're the most naturally sophisticated person I know. You just don't realize it because you're not, y'know, trying to be. [Sigh]
1192  Honestly? Good. These people need someone who's gonna—who's actually real, y'know? Someone who isn't just another MBA robot making small talk about portfolios or whatever they discuss at these things.
1193  Um, absolutely not—no way. You're going. Because like, imposter syndrome is such a—it's such a liar, okay? And also because if you don't go, I will literally never forgive you for depriving me of living vicariously through your fancy evening.
1194  I—okay that was one time! One time at your cousin's wedding and suddenly I'm branded for life as the centerpiece thief? [Laugh] But yes yes yes, thank you, I promise I'll behave. Mostly. Probably. We'll see.
1196  [trembling] Oh my god, look at how he's shaking. [voice breaking] He's pulling out the ring and I can't—this is exactly how Jake proposed to me. [Soft sob] The sunset behind them is perfect, just like ours was.
1197  [Gasping breath] He's getting on one knee! [high pitched] This part always destroys me completely. [quieter] My chest feels so tight watching this—it's beautiful but it hurts, you know? Why does happy stuff make us cry harder than sad stuff?
1198  [laughing through tears] You're right, you're absolutely right about that. [louder] Oh shit, she said yes! [Squealing] Look at them spinning around like that! My mascara is completely gone now, I must look like a raccoon who got caught in rain.
1199  [hoarse whisper] The way she covers her mouth when she realizes. [nostalgic tone] That's such a universal reaction to shock and joy, isn't it? [Shaky exhale] I did the same thing when Jake asked, before I could even say yes properly.
1200  [determined] We definitely will, don't even doubt it. [Sniffle] Should we watch another one or have we tortured ourselves enough? [lighter tone] My heart can't take much more but I'm also addicted to this beautiful pain somehow.
1201  [mock serious] Deal, but I'm choosing the next one. [getting faster] Oh wait, here comes another proposal at Disneyland! [Groaning] Why do I do this to myself? It's like emotional masochism but I literally cannot look away.
1202  [through laughter] The fireworks are perfectly timed with my sob schedule. [breathless] How do they even plan these things so well? [quieter] Meanwhile I can't even plan what I'm having for dinner tonight without having an existential crisis.
1203  [strained voice] The ring is gorgeous, look at that rock! [joking] If someone proposed to me with that, I'd say yes before they finished talking. [more serious] Actually, who am I kidding? I'd take a ring pop at this point.
1204  [exhausted tone] Okay, I'm officially emotionally drained now. [perking up] But look how her dad is crying too! [Soft sob] That's it, that's what broke me completely. Dads crying at proposals should be illegal, it's too much.
1205  [gentle] Come here, let's hug it out properly. [firmly] Your dad would be so proud of you regardless. [whispered] We're going to find love that makes everyone cry happy tears, I promise you that. Even if we're ninety when it happens.
1206  The tenant hadn't paid rent for three months, Your Honor. I sent notices on January 10th, February 8th, and March 1st—all certified mail with tracking numbers RR-4478-B, RR-5502-C, and RR-6891-A.
1207  The lease clearly states in Section 14-B that any bounced payment incurs a $150 fee. [more sternly] When she didn't pay the penalty by February 20th, that constituted breach of contract under provision 7-A-2.
1208  [impatiently] I followed proper procedure according to state statute 47-8-36. Look, after multiple attempts to contact her at phone numbers ending in 4455 and 7891, I had no choice but to take action to protect my property.
1209  Harassing? I made three legitimate maintenance visits! [more defensively] January 18th at 10 AM, January 25th at 2:30 PM, and—and February 2nd at 9:15 AM, all documented in my maintenance log ML-2024-089.
1210  That was a standard maintenance tool for the apartment 3A water leak! Your Honor, this tenant has filed seven—seven!—false complaints with the housing authority, case numbers HA-9901 through HA-9907, all dismissed as unfounded.
1211  The inspection on December 12th by license number INS-77834-Q found no hazardous conditions. She's making things up because she wants to break her lease that doesn't expire until August 31st, 2024!
1212  If she had simply paid the $2,000 she owed by March 10th as agreed in our payment plan document PP-0234, none of—none of this would have happened. [sighs heavily] I'm a reasonable man, Your Honor.
1213  Our records show account number TEN-8934-2C associated with her social security ending in 4456. Perhaps there was some, uh, administrative confusion, but she still violated the lease terms!
1214  Well, I—that's unfortunate, but the law allows for expedited eviction under emergency provision E-12. [more firmly] The water damage from her unit was affecting 3A and 3C below, causing thousands in damage!
1215  Your Honor, I... perhaps we could discuss a settlement. Maybe if she agrees to vacate by April 30th and drops the countersuit CS-2024-0789, we could waive the remaining fees of $3,847.
1216  [cheerfully] Hello, welcome to ShopEasy support! I see you're reaching out about a login issue today. Don't worry, we'll get this sorted right away—could you describe what's happening when you try to sign in?
1217  I completely understand your frustration. Let me pull up your account—what's the email address you're using? And just to confirm, you're not seeing any other error messages, right, just the invalid credentials one?
1218  Hmm, that refreshing issue is... unusual. Have you tried clearing your browser cache or maybe—actually, wait—are you using any password managers or browser extensions that might be interfering?
1219  Let's try disabling both temporarily, just to rule them out. Sometimes these extensions can conflict with our security features—it's more common than you'd think. Can you try that now while I'm here?
1220  Ah, there we go! Your ad blocker was hiding our captcha verification—that's why it kept failing. The system thought you were a bot since it couldn't verify the captcha that you couldn't even see.
1221  [Disappointed] I mean, it's kinda flattering, I guess, but like—when you showed up in the exact same jacket? [Sigh] That was a bit much.
1222  [Sarcastic] Oh wow, you just happened to dye your hair the same shade of purple? [Tsk] What a crazy coincidence, right?
1223  [Fast] Okay so basically everyone's been asking me if we coordinated and I'm like no, no we didn't, she just—[Groan] whatever.
1224  [Happy] You know what? I'm actually gonna take this as a compliment because clearly I have amazing taste! [Laugh]
1225  [Whisper] Between you and me, I think she's been, um, screenshot-ing all my outfits from Instagram. [Slow] It's getting really weird.
1226  [Angry] This is my thing—I worked really hard to develop my own style and now you're just, what, stealing it? [Shout] Find your own identity!
1227  [Sad] I used to feel special, y'know? Like I had something unique about me, but now I just—[Sigh] I dunno anymore.
1228  [Chuckle] Remember when you said my style was "too out there"? [Sarcastic] Funny how things change, huh?
1229  [Fast] She literally bought the same sneakers, the same bag, even started using my catchphrases—it's like, get your own personality! [Angry] [Tsk]
1230  [Slow] I wanna say something to her but, uh, how do you even bring that up without sounding totally paranoid? [Disappointed]
1231  [Happy] Wait, are you seriously asking where I got my vintage band tees? [Laugh] [Fast] Girl, you gotta do your own thrift store hunting!
1232  [Whisper] I actually started buying stuff I don't even like just to see if she'd copy those too. [Chuckle] She did.
1233  [Sad] [Slow] The worst part is we used to have our own distinct vibes, and now people think we're like, trying to be twins or something.
1234  [Shout] Stop tagging me in those "who wore it better" posts! [Angry] It's not funny anymore!
1235  [Sarcastic] [Fast] Oh let me guess, you suddenly discovered your love for obscure Japanese streetwear brands all by yourself?
1236  [Disappointed] I'm honestly thinking about just—I dunno, completely changing everything about how I dress. [Sigh] Maybe that'll fix this.
1237  [Happy] You know what's kinda hilarious? She copies everything except the thrift store stuff—[Laugh] [Fast] guess she's too good for secondhand!
1238  [Slow] It's not even about the clothes anymore, it's more like, er, the principle of it? [Sad] [Tsk] I thought we were closer than this.
1239  [Angry] [Fast] I spent years—YEARS—figuring out what works for me and you just waltz in and carbon copy everything in two months?
1240  [Whisper] Honestly? I'm gonna start telling people she inspired MY style. [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] See how she likes that little plot twist.
1242  Wait wait wait—you WHAT? You bought a—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like an actual house? With walls and a roof and everything?
1243  I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is so so huge. How are you feeling? Are you totally freaking out or—actually, you seem pretty calm about it.
1244  No no no, that's totally normal though. Like when I got my car I didn't believe it was mine for like... weeks? [Laugh] But a house is way bigger than that, obviously.
1245  Oh god, the paperwork—yeah, my cousin just went through that and she said her hand was literally cramping by the end. But hey, you did it! You're like, officially an adult now or whatever.
1246  Okay okay, but you know what I mean. This is different. This is like—you own property now. That's kinda wild to think about, right? Like you have a deed and everything?
1247  [Groan] Ugh, don't—don't even mention the M word. But honestly? Still worth it. No more landlords, no more rent increases, no more asking permission to hang a picture. That's gotta feel good.
1248  Yes! See, that's—that's what I'm talking about! What color are you thinking? Please don't say beige. Everyone always picks beige and it's so... boring.
1249  Ooh, moody—I love it. Very like, sophisticated and grown-up. When do you actually move in? Do you need help? Because I'm totally available to carry boxes or whatever you need.
1250  Um, obviously I'll be there. With coffee and donuts because that's what you do for moves, right? [Sigh] God, I can't believe you bought a house. Remember when we couldn't even afford decent ramen?
1251  Okay but—shut up, you know what I mean! This is just... I'm really really proud of you. Like genuinely. You worked so hard for this.
1252  I didn't—okay, I mentioned it, but only because it was literally relevant to what we were talking about. Like, everyone was sharing stories about—y'know what, never mind, you're already pissed.
1253  Yeah, and? That doesn't mean it just disappears. You never actually apologized for that whole mess, you just—[sigh] we just stopped talking about it and pretended everything was fine.
1254  No! God, that's not—I'm not punishing anyone. But sometimes stuff comes up naturally in conversation and I can't just, like, edit my entire history because you wanna pretend it didn't happen.
1255  You moved past it. You decided we were done talking about it and that was that. I never got to actually—look, I tried to bring it up a few times and you always shut me down, so...
1256  That's—okay okay, that's not fair. I didn't plan this. It just came out because, honestly? [frustrated laugh] Maybe I'm still kinda messed up about it. Maybe I needed to actually deal with it instead of just burying it.
1257  I know how long it's been! But time doesn't just magically fix things that never got resolved. You hurt me—like, really hurt me—and we never actually talked about it. We just... moved on.
1258  I dunno, maybe just acknowledge that it happened? That it mattered? Instead of acting like I'm—like I'm crazy for still having feelings about it. You can't just decide when someone else should be over something.
1259  Oh, come on, don't—don't do that. Don't make it sound like some chore you're gonna check off your list. [scoff] This is exactly what you did last time.
1260  Are you though? Because it feels like you're just—you're mad that I embarrassed you, not that there's actually something unfinished between us. Like, you still don't think you did anything wrong, do you?
1261  It didn't—I know it didn't help, okay? I'm not saying it was the right time or place, but sometimes stuff just... bubbles up. And maybe if we'd actually dealt with it properly, it wouldn't keep happening. I'm sorry it came out like that, but I'm not sorry for still feeling some type of way about it.
1262  I know, I know, okay? I just—there was so much going on with planning this thing and I literally had like twenty people to coordinate and somehow it just... slipped my mind. [frustrated laugh] Which I realize sounds terrible.
1263  That's not—come on, that's not true. Remember your birthday? I made that whole separate dish just for you. And—and the barbecue last month? I literally bought those expensive vegan burgers.
1264  Okay, fine, maybe I'm not perfect about it, but you're acting like I do this intentionally. I don't—I genuinely forgot this time. There's a difference between forgetting and not caring.
1265  That's... [scoff] wow. That's really what you think of me? After everything? I mean, I'm sorry I'm not keeping a spreadsheet of everyone's dietary stuff, but I'm trying here.
1266  I—okay, you know what? Maybe I'm not trying hard enough for your standards, but I'm also planning these entire get-togethers while everyone else just shows up. Including you. So maybe—maybe cut me some slack?
1267  Because you offering to help doesn't—it doesn't fix the fact that I should remember, I get that. But honestly? Sometimes it feels like you're just... waiting for me to mess up so you can be disappointed.
1268  And that sucks, it really does, and I'm—look, I am sorry about that part. [sigh] But you could've reminded me when I sent the group chat about food. Like, one text. That's all.
1269  No, you shouldn't. You're right. But we're—we're supposed to be friends, right? And sometimes friends mess up. I dunno, I just thought you'd be more... understanding, I guess.
1270  Don't do that—don't make it sound like—ugh. Look look, I screwed up, okay? I admit it. But you're acting like this is some massive betrayal when it's literally just... my brain being garbage at remembering details.
1271  That's—okay, that's fair. That's actually... yeah. [quieter] I didn't think about it like that. I just—I saw it as a food thing, not a... you thing. Which I guess is the problem, huh.
1272  I know, I know, I'm so sorry—there was this whole thing with the subway and then I—wait, actually no, let me start over. I should've texted you. I totally should've texted.
1273  Okay, yeah, that's—that's fair. Um, honestly? I lost track of time at first, which I know sounds terrible but then the train just stopped for like twenty minutes and I couldn't get signal underground [nervous laugh] and I kept thinking "they're gonna kill me, they're literally gonna kill me."
1274  Oh god, you—you waited outside? I thought you'd just grab a table and—no, that's even worse, isn't it? You were just standing there waiting for me like an idiot because I'm an idiot.
1275  I'm really, really sorry. Like, genuinely. This isn't—I don't mean to be that friend, y'know? The one who's always late and everyone just expects it. That's not who I wanna be.
1276  I—yeah. Yeah, you're right. [Sigh] I guess I am. It's not on purpose though, I swear, it's just like my brain doesn't process time right or something? That sounds like an excuse—it is an excuse. Sorry.
1277  But you didn't? You—you stayed and waited for me even though I'm literally the worst friend ever and I don't deserve—sorry, I'm not trying to make this about me. I just... thank you for not leaving.
1278  No no no, totally get that. You should be mad. I would be—actually, I'd probably have left after like fifteen minutes, so the fact that you stayed means you're basically a saint and I'm just this disaster person who can't even—[groan] I'm doing it again, aren't I? The rambling thing.
1279  Right. Okay. Shutting up now. Except—wait, can I just say one more thing? I'm gonna set like five alarms next time. Actually, you know what? You can just tell me to show up an hour before you actually wanna meet.
1280  Really? You're not—I mean, you're still mad, I can tell, but like... we're okay? Or we're gonna be okay? Eventually?
1281  Yes! Absolutely, whatever you want—I'm buying everything. The most expensive thing on the menu, I don't even care. And next time I'm gonna be early, I swear, like awkwardly early where I'm just sitting there for twenty minutes checking my phone.
1282  Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's incredible! I mean, finally, right? They've been making you wait forever for this.
1283  Senior director! That's—okay, that's huge. Like, actually huge. How are you even being so calm about this? I'd be literally bouncing off the walls [Laugh] or something.
1284  No no, I get it, I totally get it. It's like—you work so hard for something and then when it actually happens you're just... numb? Kinda? But seriously, you've earned this.
1285  God, three years—that's actually criminal how long they made you wait. But you never gave up, y'know? Even when they kept moving the goalposts and being all—ugh, corporate nonsense.
1286  I remember! That one time you were literally—you had the resignation letter drafted and everything. [Sigh] Thank god you didn't though, right? I mean, look at you now.
1287  They—wait, they actually apologized? Like, management admitted they were wrong? That's... honestly that's kinda unheard of. What did they even say?
1288  Budget issues, sure sure—I mean, it's always budget issues, isn't it? But at least they're like, acknowledging it now. Are you gonna celebrate or—actually, we should definitely celebrate.
1289  Okay okay, but this is different! This is like—you've been grinding for this forever, and I've watched you just... pour everything into that place. Even just dinner? Something small?
1290  Yes! Perfect, totally—we can go to that place you like with the, um, the really good pasta? [Chuckle] The one where they don't play music too loud?
1291  Oh stop—no no, don't even. I'm just, I'm really proud of you, okay? Like genuinely. You deserve every bit of this, even if you're gonna be all modest about it.
1293  [exhausted but elated] My sword arm burns like fire, but by God, it was worth every swing. [deep satisfied sigh] Their so-called impenetrable walls crumbled like bread. [building excitement] We actually did it, brother!
1294  [gravely] The cost was steep though. [slower pace] Young Marcus, brave Thomas, that fool Geoffrey with his jokes... [bitter laugh] They should be here planting this flag with us, not lying cold in the mud below.
1295  [weary tone] What now, though? [contemplative] We've toppled kings, conquered the unconquerable. [nervous laugh] Do we become lords ourselves, or does the road call us to more battles, more blood, more glory somewhere else?
1296  [relieved laughter] Thank God you said it first! [warmly] I was terrified you'd want to settle down, grow fat on wine. [loud declaration] Our work isn't finished until every corrupt castle bears a righteous flag!
1297  [joyful bellow] Then let them hear us from the valleys to the mountains! [commanding tone] Victory is ours! [Thunderous roar] The age of tyranny ends today, and the age of justice begins NOW!
1298  [confused] Wait, wait, wait. [slower] The blue and green peacock scarf? [voice rising] From Margot's Boutique on Fifth Street? Because I literally have that exact same scarf [Nervous laugh] sitting in my car right now.
1299  [hysterically] I'm dying, I'm actually dying right now! [Gasping breath] Remember when we were kids and showed up in matching outfits? [quieter] She's never letting us live this down. [Cackling] Never ever ever.
1300  [mockingly] Oh brilliant, yes, because every woman dreams of duplicate scarves! [Hissing laugh] Or wait— [excited whisper] what if I return mine super quick and grab those earrings instead? [hopefully] The mall's still open for another hour.
1301  [in disbelief] Three hundred dollar scarves. [voice dropping] Three HUNDRED dollars each and we picked the same one. [Explosive laugh] At least it proves we both have expensive taste? [weakly] That's genetic, right? Good genes?
1302  [panicking] Oh God, Aunt Linda's going to post about this on Facebook! [in dread] "My nieces bought their mother matching scarves, so precious!" [Choking laugh] With like fifty emoji hearts. [resigned] Our reputation as adults is officially over.
1303  [sarcastically bright] Oh sure, we're very observant! [deadpan] So observant we observed the exact same thing. [Wheezing laugh] Next year we're making a shared spreadsheet. [firmly] With color coding and everything, I'm not kidding anymore.
1304  [exhausted] I can't breathe, seriously stop! [Gasping] My stomach hurts from laughing. [in a whisper] But imagine Mom's face when she opens the second one. [building up] "Oh wow, another peacock scarf, how... thoughtful?"
1305  [resigned laugh] You're insane but I love it. [thoughtfully] Although knowing Mom, she'll probably keep both and wear them [sing-song voice] at the same time somehow. [Snort] Remember her layering phase? This is perfect actually.
1306  [playing along] Absolutely! [in fake commercial voice] "The Peacock Scarf Collection, by daughters who definitely planned this!" [normally] We should walk in together holding them up like [Giggling] synchronized swimmers. [determined] Own it completely, no shame.
1307  [tenderly] You're right, she really will. [Soft laugh] Two disasters of daughters who love her enough to buy the same overpriced scarf. [warmly building] Come on, let's go face this together. [cheerfully] Matching gift bags and everything!
1308  Good morning, I can definitely help you with that portal access issue. Let me pull up your account using that MRN number—45782, correct? While I'm looking, have you tried the "forgot password" link on the login page at www.healthportal.medcenter.org/reset?
1309  [sympathetically] I completely understand your urgency, especially with tomorrow's appointment approaching. I see here your email on file is actually patricia.k.wilson@yahoo.com, not Gmail—could that be why? [pause] Let me update it right now to your current Gmail address, if you can verify it for me?
1310  No worries at all, these portals can definitely be confusing sometimes. I'm seeing that particular reset link expired after 24 hours, which would be, um, 9:47 AM today. Let me generate a fresh one for you right now—it'll be valid for the next 48 hours this time.
1311  Your username should actually be your full email address, not that PW number—that's just your temporary access code from initial registration. Sometimes the system gets confused if you're using autofill on your browser. Try clearing your cache or, even better, using an incognito window when you attempt to log in.
1312  Of course, I can walk you through it step by step, no worries! For now, I've sent that new reset link to your Yahoo email—should arrive within 2-3 minutes. When you get it, click the blue button that says "Reset Now," enter the temporary password XK9-TMP-2024, then create your own new password with at least 8 characters.
1313  Sir, I understand you're upset about the temperature of your food. Let me—let me pull up your order details here. When exactly did you pick it up?
1314  That's absolutely not acceptable, and I'm truly sorry. We pride ourselves on hot, fresh food—this shouldn't happen. Can you bring the order back so we can remake it immediately?
1315  Of course, of course, I completely understand your frustration. [briskly] Here's what I can do—we'll prepare a fresh order right away. And naturally, there'll be no charge for either meal.
1316  I'll personally supervise the kitchen myself this time. In fact—wait, let me check—yes, I can have our driver deliver it. Should be there in, oh, twenty-five minutes maximum.
1317  No, no, you're not being difficult at all—cold food ruins everything. I'm adding a complimentary dessert for your trouble. What's the special occasion, if you don't mind me asking?
1318  Oh, that's wonderful—congratulations to her! You know what? Let me throw in our chocolate lava cake too. Kids love that one, trust me.
1319  Yes, fifteen years now, believe it or not. Listen, I'm writing a note for your file—next visit, appetizers are on us. We want to make this right.
1320  I've dealt with my share of those calls! Your driver's name is Marcus, he'll text when he's close. Everything will be piping hot, I promise.
1321  Please, don't apologize—you had every right to be upset. Cold food after paying good money? I'd be calling too, probably less politely.
1322  That's what we're here for—real solutions, not just damage control. Oh, Marcus just left—twenty minutes, tops. [warmly] Tell your daughter congratulations from all of us.
1323  [Happy] So, um, you actually like horror movies too? [Laugh] I thought I was gonna have to pretend to enjoy rom-coms for the next few hours!
1324  [Whisper] Okay, don't look now, but I think that couple behind us is having, like, the world's most intense breakup. [Fast] Should we move tables or just embrace the drama?
1325  [Sad] I'm gonna be honest, I almost canceled tonight because I was so nervous—I mean, dating apps are weird, right? [Sigh]
1326  [Slow] This place has, um, really changed since I was here last. [Disappointed] It used to be way more—I dunno, cozy?
1327  [Sarcastic] Oh great, my ex just walked in. [Tsk] This is exactly what I needed to make tonight less awkward.
1328  [Fast] Wait, you're telling me you've never tried sushi? [Happy] Oh my god, we gotta fix that—I know this amazing place that does, like, beginner-friendly rolls!
1329  [Angry] Sorry, I just—I literally got stood up last week, so I'm kinda... [Sigh] No, forget it, fresh start, right?
1330  [Chuckle] Your profile said you like adventure, but, uh, does ordering the weirdest thing on the menu count? [Happy] 'Cause I'm totally gonna do it.
