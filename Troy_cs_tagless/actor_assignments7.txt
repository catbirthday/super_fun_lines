Character 1: You threw up on my boss.

494 Character 2: Oh god, I—I know, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get that drunk, honestly I thought I was fine and then suddenly everything just hit me all at once and—

Character 1: In front of everyone.

495 Character 2: I know, I know, it was—it was awful. Like, I woke up this morning and literally wanted to die when I remembered. Wait, no, that's not—I mean, I feel terrible about it. [groan] I can't believe I did that to you.

Character 1: Three shots. You promised three shots maximum.

496 Character 2: Yeah, I—okay, so here's what happened. I had the three shots, right? But then Karen from accounting kept buying rounds and I didn't wanna be rude, y'know? And I thought—I thought I could handle it because I'd eaten dinner but apparently not.

Character 1: Karen from accounting wasn't the one projectile vomiting.

497 Character 2: No, she—she wasn't. That was all me. [nervous laugh] God, I'm such an idiot. I literally ruined your whole work party, didn't I? Your boss probably thinks you hang out with total disasters now.

Character 1: He asked if you needed rehab.

498 Character 2: He what? Oh my god, no no no, I'm not—I don't have a problem, I swear. It was just one stupid night where I didn't—I wasn't paying attention to how much I was drinking and I'm so, so sorry.

Character 1: This isn't the first time you've done this.

499 Character 2: Okay, that's—that's fair. The birthday thing was bad too. And New Year's. But I promise you, like genuinely promise, I'm gonna get better about knowing my limits. I don't wanna be that friend, y'know? The one who always—[sigh] the one who always makes everything about their drama.

Character 1: I had to drive you home. Clean you up. Apologize to everyone.

500 Character 2: I know you did and I—I owe you so much for that. Like, you could've just left me there but you didn't and... I'm gonna make this up to you, okay? Whatever you need. I'll call your boss, apologize personally, pay for dry cleaning, literally anything.

Character 1: You can't call my boss. That would make it worse.

501 Character 2: Right, yeah, no—of course not. That would be... yeah. Um, but seriously though, there's gotta be something I can do? I hate that I put you in that position. Like, you were so excited about this party and I just—I ruined it completely.

Character 1: You did ruin it.

502 Character 2: I did. I really, really did. And I'm—look, I know saying sorry doesn't fix it but I need you to know that I'm gonna do better. No more drinking at your work things, actually maybe no more drinking period for a while because clearly I can't—I can't trust myself right now.

Character 1: That would be a start.

503 Character 2: Yeah? Okay, then—then that's what I'm doing. Stone cold sober from now on, at least until I figure out how to not be a complete disaster. And I'm—I'm really sorry. You're like my best friend and I hate that I embarrassed you like that. It won't happen again, I promise.

Script: a66393f3_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You missed it.

504 Character 2: I know, I know, okay? But my mom literally called me crying about my grandma being in the hospital and I—I had to go. What was I supposed to do?

Character 1: You could've told me.

505 Character 2: I did tell you! I texted you like—okay, maybe it was last minute, but everything happened so fast. [frustrated laugh] We were literally in the car already when I remembered to message you.

Character 1: Twenty minutes before. That's when you texted.

506 Character 2: Yeah, and I'm sorry about the timing, but come on—my grandma was having chest pains. You're acting like I just decided to skip it for fun or something.

Character 1: This was my only show. The only one.

507 Character 2: I know that, and I wanted to be there, I really did. But you're—you're making it sound like I had a choice here. Family emergencies don't exactly schedule themselves around our plans, y'know?

Character 1: Everyone else made it.

508 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's not fair. Everyone else wasn't dealing with their grandma potentially dying. [sigh] Look, I get that you're hurt, I do, but this is kinda harsh.

Character 1: I needed you there.

509 Character 2: And I needed to be with my family! God, why is that so hard for you to—I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I missed it. But I'm not gonna apologize for prioritizing my grandma.

Character 1: Fine.

510 Character 2: Fine? That's it? Just "fine"? You know what, I'm getting pretty frustrated here too because it feels like you don't even care about what I was going through that night.

Character 1: You didn't care about what I was going through.

511 Character 2: That's—wow. That's really what you think? I've been to every single other thing you've done. Every open mic, every rehearsal you wanted me at. One time—ONE time—I can't make it because of an actual emergency and suddenly I don't care?

Character 1: The most important one.

512 Character 2: Yeah, and I feel terrible about that, honestly I do. But you're not—[scoff] you're not even trying to understand. Like, at all. My grandma could've died and you're mad about a show.

Character 1: It wasn't just a show.

513 Character 2: I know it wasn't just—look, I know how much it meant to you, okay? And maybe I should've... I dunno, tried harder to explain or something. But I'm not gonna stand here and pretend I made the wrong choice. I didn't.

Script: e8351094_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk.

514 Character 2: Um, okay? What's—what's going on? You've been weird all week and now you're doing this whole dramatic thing where you're like... I dunno, being all intense.

Character 1: You were on your phone the entire time yesterday.

515 Character 2: That's—okay, that's not even true. I checked it maybe like three times? Four? And honestly, you're always telling me stuff while I'm trying to work, so—[scoff] sorry if I had to respond to my boss.

Character 1: My dad's in the hospital.

516 Character 2: Wait, what? When did—why didn't you say that? You were just talking about random stuff, I didn't know it was... I mean, you gotta tell me these things.

Character 1: I did tell you. Three times.

517 Character 2: No, you—okay okay, maybe you mentioned something but you didn't say it was serious. You're always so casual about everything, how was I supposed to know this was different? [frustrated laugh] I'm not a mind reader.

Character 1: "My dad had a heart attack." Pretty clear.

518 Character 2: Look, if you said that—and I'm not saying you didn't—but if you did, I obviously didn't hear it properly. Maybe I was distracted, fine, but you could've like, I dunno, made sure I was listening?

Character 1: That's my job now?

519 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not what I meant. I'm sorry about your dad, I am, that's terrible. But you're acting like I don't care when really I just... [sigh] I literally had three deadlines yesterday.

Character 1: Right. Your deadlines.

520 Character 2: See, this is what you do. You make it sound like—like my stuff doesn't matter at all. Yeah, they're not family emergencies, but I can't just ignore my whole life every time you need to talk.

Character 1: Every time? This is my dad.

521 Character 2: I know, I know! And I'm—I feel terrible about missing that, okay? But honestly? You do this thing where you just expect me to drop everything, and usually I do, but yesterday was literally the worst possible day.

Character 1: Good to know where I rank.

522 Character 2: Oh my god, stop. That's so—you're being so unfair right now. I've been there for you through everything, literally everything, and the one time I'm not perfect, you're gonna—what, throw away our whole friendship?

Character 1: You haven't asked how he is.

523 Character 2: I—okay. You're right. [quieter] How is he? Is he gonna be okay? I should've—yeah, I should've asked that first. I'm just... I'm defensive 'cause I feel like shit about this, y'know?

Script: 9a495032_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You never even said sorry.

524 Character 2: What? Wait, I—hold on, what do you mean? I thought we were—I mean, after everything that happened, I figured we just kinda... moved past it?

Character 1: Moved past it.

525 Character 2: Okay, that's—that's not what I meant. I just, um, I thought since we were still hanging out and stuff that you weren't—[nervous laugh] god, I'm such an idiot. You've been upset this whole time, haven't you?

Character 1: What do you think?

526 Character 2: No no no, you're right. You're totally right. I should've—I mean, obviously I should've actually talked to you about it instead of just... pretending nothing happened. That was really messed up of me.

Character 1: Yeah. It was.

527 Character 2: I honestly don't know why I didn't say anything. Like, I knew I hurt you—I could see it on your face when it happened, y'know? And I just... I dunno, I got scared? [groan] That's not an excuse though.

Character 1: I waited for you to say something. Anything.

528 Character 2: God, I'm—I'm so sorry. Like, genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I was being a coward, basically, and that's not fair to you at all. You deserved an apology right away, not... whatever this is.

Character 1: Do you even know what you did?

529 Character 2: The comment about—about your presentation, right? When I said it was "kinda basic" in front of everyone? I've been replaying it in my head and I just—ugh, I wanna crawl into a hole every time I think about it.

Character 1: It wasn't just that.

530 Character 2: Wait wait wait, there's more? Oh god—was it also when I laughed? Because I swear I wasn't laughing at you, I was just nervous and—actually no, that doesn't matter. Impact over intent, right? I hurt you and that's what matters. [sigh]

Character 1: You knew how hard I worked on that.

531 Character 2: I did. I literally watched you stay up till like 3 AM working on it for weeks. And then I just—I opened my stupid mouth and ruined it. I'm so, so sorry. I should've been supporting you, not... being an absolute jerk.

Character 1: Why didn't you just apologize?

532 Character 2: Because I'm—I'm really bad at confrontation? And the longer I waited, the worse it got, and then I convinced myself that bringing it up would make things weird when really I was already making things weird by not saying anything. Classic me, honestly, making everything worse.

Character 1: I just needed to hear you say it. That's all.

533 Character 2: I know. And I'm sorry—not just for what I said, but for taking this long to apologize. You're one of my best friends and you deserved so much better than... than me being too scared to own up to my mistakes. Can we—can we be okay?

Script: 309cab74_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: I got in.

534 Character 2: Got in? Got in where? Wait—oh my god, is this about the residency thing? The one in, um, where was it again?

Character 1: Vermont. Three months.

535 Character 2: Shut up shut up shut UP! Are you—this is huge! Like, this is literally what you've been working toward for, what, two years now? [Gasp] Oh my god, when do you leave?

Character 1: Six weeks. Still processing it.

536 Character 2: Okay okay, I mean, yeah, of course you're still processing because this is like—this changes everything, right? You're gonna have actual time to just... create. No distractions, no stupid day job stuff.

Character 1: It's terrifying.

537 Character 2: Wait, terrifying? But you—honestly, you've been complaining about never having enough time for your work since, like, forever. Isn't this kinda exactly what you wanted?

Character 1: What if I can't produce anything good? What if I just sit there for three months?

538 Character 2: Oh no no no, okay, I get it now. The whole—the pressure thing. But like [Sigh] you wouldn't have gotten in if they didn't already think your stuff was incredible, y'know?

Character 1: They picked fifteen people out of eight hundred applicants.

539 Character 2: That's—wait, that's like less than, um, two percent? Holy shit. You beat out literally hundreds of people and you're worried about—actually, you know what? This is so you.

Character 1: What's that supposed to mean?

540 Character 2: I mean, you always do this thing where something amazing happens and you immediately start, like, catastrophizing about it? Remember when you got that gallery show and spent the whole week before convinced everyone would hate it? [Chuckle]

Character 1: That was different.

541 Character 2: Was it though? Was it really? Because from where I'm sitting, it's the same exact—you're doing that face. The one where you know I'm right but you're gonna be stubborn about it anyway.

Character 1: I just... what if I'm not ready?

542 Character 2: Okay but like—nobody's ever ready ready, right? That's kinda the whole point of these things. You go, you figure it out, you probably have some breakdowns in the studio at 2am, and then you make something incredible.

Character 1: You really think I should do it.

543 Character 2: Um, are you kidding me right now? If you don't go, I will literally—I don't know what I'll do but it'll be dramatic and you'll hate it. This is your thing, babe. Your actual thing.

544 SCENARIO: debating whether to send a risky text

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um— should I just send it? I mean, it's not that bad, right? It's just, uh, it's just a little joke about what happened at lunch, and like— like, maybe they'll think it's funny? Or maybe they'll think I'm, um, I'm totally weird for bringing it up again.

[slightly nervous]

But I mean, we were laughing about it, so that's— that's a good sign, right? Right? [sigh] God, why is this so— why do I always overthink these things? It's literally just a text. People send texts all the time.

[faster]

Okay, but what if they don't respond? What if they think I'm being too, um, too forward or something? Because we don't really text that much, and this is kind of— it's kind of random, isn't it?

[hesitant]

Unless... unless it's not that random? I mean, they did give me their number, so they probably— they probably want me to use it, right? [hmm] That's how numbers work.

[decisive, then wavering]

You know what? I'm just gonna— I'm gonna send it. Life's too short to, uh, to worry about every little— [pause] or maybe I should wait until tomorrow?

[resigned]

Ugh, okay, no. Sending it now before I, um, before I chicken out completely.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 7ae07608 | Role: Character 1 (A)

545 Character 1: [voice breaking] Mom always said she wanted to be scattered here, [quieter] where Dad proposed. [Sharp inhale] I keep thinking she's going to walk up behind us and laugh about how we're doing it all wrong.

Character 2: [thick with tears] Remember how she'd sit right there on that rock? [wavering] Every Sunday after church, just watching the water. [Shaky breath] God, I can still smell her perfume when the wind picks up like this.

546 Character 1: [firmly] We should say something. [more uncertainly] She deserves words, proper ones. [clearing throat] Though everything I practiced in the car sounds stupid now that we're actually standing here with the urn.

Character 2: [bitter laugh] Words were never our thing, were they? [softer] Always her department. [Stifled sob] She could make grocery lists sound like poetry, and here we are, two grown men who can't string a sentence together.

547 Character 1: [suddenly urgent] Wait, wait—are we doing this too fast? [panicked] Once she's in the wind, that's it. [voice dropping] No more putting flowers on a grave, no place to visit when we need her.

Character 2: [gently] She's not in there, Danny. [more firmly] That's just dust and calcium. [Long exhale] Mom's in your terrible dad jokes and my stubborn streak—she's already everywhere we need her to be.

548 Character 1: [defensive] My jokes aren't terrible! [cracking] She laughed at every single one. [whispered] Even the really bad ones about chickens crossing roads. Sometimes I still catch myself saving the good ones to tell her.

Character 2: [nostalgic warmth] Tuesday nights, she'd call you first. [gradually sadder] Then me right after, pretending she hadn't already heard all your news. [Quiet laugh] I never told her I knew—seemed important to let her have that.

549 Character 1: [rushed words] The wind's picking up—should we do it now? [steadier] Together, like we promised? [Shuddering breath] I can't believe this is really happening, that we're really saying goodbye to her forever.

Character 2: [hoarse whisper] On three? [stronger] We'll tip it together, let her fly. [voice catching] She always said she wanted to travel more—guess this is her chance to go absolutely everywhere at once.

550 Character 1: [determined] One. [more shakily] This is for all the bedtime stories and band-aids. [Gulping breath] For every time she said she was proud of us even when we didn't deserve it.

Character 2: [trembling] Two. [steadying himself] For the light she left on when we stayed out too late. [almost inaudible] For forgiving us for all those calls we should have made but didn't.

551 Character 1: [in unison] Three. [Soft gasp] Oh God, look at her go—she's dancing in the sunlight. [through tears] The way the ashes catch the light, it's actually beautiful, like she's becoming part of everything.

Character 2: [awed whisper] She's really gone. [normal volume] But look how far she's already traveling. [Choked laugh] Typical Mom, couldn't wait to start her next adventure, probably already bossing God around up there.

552 Character 1: [exhausted] My hands won't stop shaking. [quieter] Is it wrong that I already miss having the urn to hold? [Ragged breath] At least that was something solid, something that proved she existed.

Character 2: [thoughtfully] She existed in more than objects, Danny. [with conviction] She existed in forty years of Christmas mornings and birthday calls. [voice softening] In every single time we choose kindness because that's what she would do.

553 Character 1: [suddenly clear] We should head back before dark. [gentler] But maybe we could stop at that diner she loved? [Sniffling] Order her usual and leave the seat empty—one last meal together.

Character 2: [relieved] Yes, God, yes. [warmly] Blueberry pancakes with extra whipped cream. [quiet amazement] How did someone so health-conscious love something so ridiculously sweet? She was always such a beautiful contradiction.

554 Character 1: [peaceful] The water's so calm now. [in wonder] Like it was waiting for her. [Deep breath] I think I finally understand why she chose this place—it's not an ending, it's a joining.

Character 2: [quietly firm] We did good, Danny. [more emotional] She would've been proud. [Shaky exhale] Come on, little brother—let's go eat too many pancakes and cry into our coffee like real men.

Script: 87bf17c8 | Role: Customer Support

 Character 1: [gruff] Yeah, hello, this is Harold Brennan calling about my mother, Ethel Brennan, [raising voice] she's in room 247-B. [clears throat] I need to speak to someone immediately about the, uh, the absolutely unacceptable conditions she's been subjected to.

555 Customer Support: D2: Good afternoon, Mr. Brennan, this is Sarah from Willowbrook Care Center. I'm sorry to hear you have concerns. [more gently] Could you please verify your mother's patient ID number—it should start with WB2024—so I can pull up her file?

 Character 1: [impatiently] It's WB2024-8847-J, for crying out loud. [bitter] She called me yesterday saying nobody's changed her bedsheets in over a week, [getting louder] and the food's been cold every single meal since Tuesday!

556 Customer Support: D4: Mr. Brennan, I sincerely apologize for these issues. I'm looking at her care log right now, and——well, I do see a notation here. Could you tell me which staff members she mentioned specifically?

 Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, she mentioned plenty—that nurse, uh, Rodriguez or Ramirez, badge number 4-5-something. [sighs heavily] Look, we're paying $8,750 a month for proper care, [more forcefully] not for her to sit in filth!

557 Customer Support: D6: Sir, I understand your frustration completely. [more firmly] However, our records indicate housekeeping visited room 247-B on Monday at 2:15 PM and Wednesday at 3:30. Perhaps there's been some miscommunication with your mother?

 Character 1: [outraged] Miscommunication? [scoffs] My mother's sharp as a tack—she's got her doctorate from Harvard, for God's sake! [accusingly] Are you suggesting she's lying about the neglect at your establishment?

558 Customer Support: D8: [quickly] No, no, absolutely not, Mr. Brennan. I'm simply trying to understand the full situation here. Would you like me to schedule an immediate meeting with our director, Mrs. Chen, tomorrow at, say, 10:30 AM?

 Character 1: [grudgingly] Fine, but I'm also contacting the state ombudsman at 1-800-555-CARE. [threatening] My lawyer brother already has your facility's license number—HC-7789-MA—ready for the complaint. [sighs] This better get fixed immediately.

559 Customer Support: D10: Mr. Brennan, please, let's resolve this internally first. [more earnestly] I'm escalating this right now to our quality assurance team, case number QA-2024-11-0892. We take every concern seriously, and I promise we'll have answers by tomorrow morning.

560 Customer Support: Good morning, this is Riverside Veterinary Clinic! I see you've emailed about appointment availability—let me just pull up our schedule. How can I help your pet today?

Character 1: [anxiously] Hi, yes, my cat Oliver has been, um, acting really strange lately. [worried] He's not eating much and just... hides under the bed constantly. [urgently] I really need to get him seen as soon as possible.

561 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Oh, I understand that's concerning. Let me check what we have—actually, we had a cancellation for tomorrow at 2 PM. Dr. Martinez is excellent with cats, especially nervous ones.

Character 1: [relieved] Tomorrow? Oh thank goodness, that's—that would be perfect. [hesitant] Wait, is that the full examination appointment? [more worried] Because I think he might need blood work or something comprehensive.

562 Customer Support: Yes, absolutely, it's a full 30-minute consultation slot. Dr. Martinez can do blood work, urinalysis, whatever's needed. The initial exam is $85, and we'll discuss any additional tests during the visit.

Character 1: [nervously] Right, okay, the cost is... fine, whatever he needs. [sighs] Should I bring anything specific? [frantically] His vaccination records, or maybe a stool sample, or—I don't know what you need.

563 Customer Support: [calmly] Just bring his vaccination records if you have them. No need for samples unless the doctor requests them after examination. Oh, and maybe bring his favorite blanket—sometimes that helps with stress.

Character 1: [gratefully] His blanket, yes, that's actually really thoughtful. [pause] [anxiously] One more thing—he absolutely hates car rides. [desperately] Do you have any tips for getting him there without total chaos?

564 Customer Support: Cover the carrier with a towel, helps reduce visual stimulation. Some clients spray Feliway about 15 minutes before—it's a calming pheromone. We sell it here, but pet stores have it too.

Character 1: [determined] Feliway, covered carrier, got it. [sighs deeply] I'll take that 2 PM slot tomorrow then. [more confidently] Thank you so much for squeezing us in—I've been really worried about him.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

565 [Nervous] So, uh, anyway... [Fast] should we maybe talk about literally anything else right now or—no? We're just gonna sit here? [Chuckle]

566 [Whisper] I feel like I should say something but honestly I don't—I mean, what do you even say after that? [Sigh]

567 [Sarcastic] Wow, this is fun. [Slow] Really enjoying the, um, the whole nobody-talking thing we've got going on here. [Tsk]

568 [Happy] You know what, I actually kinda like this! [Laugh] No pressure to make conversation, just... existing together, right?

569 [Angry] Are you seriously not gonna—look, somebody needs to say something because this is getting ridiculous! [Groan]

570 [Slow] Does anyone else hear that clock ticking or is it just—[Fast] okay yeah, it's definitely getting louder somehow. [Nervous] [Chuckle]

571 [Disappointed] I thought we were past this whole, you know, not being able to talk to each other thing. [Sigh] Guess not.

572 [Shout] WELL THEN! [Normal] That's, uh, that's one way to end a conversation, I guess.

573 [Fast] So my cat did this really funny thing yesterday where she—actually, you probably don't wanna hear about that right now, do you? [Tsk]

574 [Sad] This is exactly what happened last time and I just—I can't do this again, okay? [Sigh] [Whisper] Not again.

575 [Sarcastic] Anyone wanna play a game where we count how many seconds this lasts? [Chuckle] I'm at thirty-seven, but who's counting, right?

576 [Slow] You ever notice how, like, silence can be really loud sometimes? [Fast] This is one of those times, definitely one of those times.

577 [Happy] Oh my god, are we having a moment? [Laugh] [Whisper] Is this what people mean by comfortable silence?

578 [Angry] I didn't drive all the way here to just—to sit in silence! [Disappointed] Come on, somebody say something!

579 [Fast] Okay so basically what I'm hearing is nothing, which is—that's cool, that's totally fine, I can work with nothing. [Nervous] [Chuckle]

580 [Whisper] Should I just... leave? [Normal] Like, would that make this less weird or more weird? [Tsk]

581 [Sarcastic] Great weather we're having. [Slow] Oh wait, we're inside, so... great ceiling we're having? [Groan]

582 [Sad] I used to be really good at filling these gaps but now I just—I dunno, I got nothing. [Sigh]

583 [Shout] ANYBODY WANT COFFEE? [Fast] I'm gonna go make coffee, that's what I'm doing, coffee fixes everything! [Nervous] [Laugh]

584 [Disappointed] We literally just met and we're already out of things to—[Slow] wow, this doesn't bode well, does it? [Tsk] [Sigh]

585 SCENARIO: Calmly talking about a gift they regifted, then remembering who they gave it to, then realizing it was the original gifter, ending in social horror

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, so I finally did something with that scented candle set I've had sitting in my closet forever. You know, the lavender one? I wrapped it up nice and gave it to someone for their housewarming party last weekend.

[conversational]

It felt good to actually use it, you know? Like, I never burn candles anyway, and it was just taking up space. Better to give it to someone who'd actually appreciate it.

[matter-of-fact]

The party was really nice too. Sarah seemed to love all her gifts, and her new place is gorgeous. She was so excited about everything, it was sweet.

[slowing down slightly]

Actually, wait... [pause] Sarah's housewarming. That lavender candle set. The one with the little— the little gold ribbons around each candle?

[realization dawning]

Oh no. Oh no no no. [nervous laugh] That was... that was from Sarah. She gave me that candle set. For my birthday. Last month.

[mortified]

I regifted Sarah's gift back to Sarah! [groan] At her own housewarming party! She probably recognized it immediately!

[spiraling] [panicked]

Oh my god, she was probably just being polite when she thanked me! She knows! She totally knows I regifted her own present back to her! [whimper] I'm the worst friend ever! How do I— what do I even— [defeated] I can never show my face again.
