Script: 2189820a_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three weeks. I was there for three weeks.

175 Character 2: I know, I know how long you were—look, I wanted to come, okay? I did. But hospitals are just... [exhale] they're really hard for me. Like, really hard.

Character 1: Right.

176 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Don't just say "right" like that. You know about my anxiety, I've told you about the whole thing with my mom and—I mean, I literally can't even drive past one without feeling like I'm gonna throw up.

Character 1: Everyone else managed to show up.

177 Character 2: That's not—okay okay, that's not fair. Everyone else doesn't have panic attacks in medical settings. I texted you every day, I sent food, I called—I was trying to be there in the ways I could, y'know?

Character 1: It's not the same.

178 Character 2: No, it's not the same, you're right. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I just... forgot about you or something. [scoff] Like I was just hanging out, having a great time while you were there.

Character 1: Weren't you?

179 Character 2: Are you serious right now? I was—I was literally worried sick about you the entire time. I couldn't sleep, I was checking my phone constantly for updates, I was—honestly, this is really unfair.

Character 1: I needed you there.

180 Character 2: And I needed to not have a complete breakdown in your hospital room! That's—that would've made everything worse, wouldn't it? Me hyperventilating while you're trying to recover?

Character 1: You could've tried.

181 Character 2: I did try! I got—I got all the way to the parking garage twice. Twice. And both times I just... I couldn't. [frustrated laugh] But sure, yeah, I guess that doesn't count as trying.

Character 1: It doesn't.

182 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So basically nothing I did matters because I couldn't physically be in that room. The daily check-ins, the—the care packages, asking your sister for updates every few hours, none of that counts.

Character 1: You're my best friend. Were.

183 Character 2: Oh, come on, don't—don't do the past tense thing. Look look, I'm sorry I couldn't be there the way you wanted. I am. But I was drowning in my own stuff and trying—trying really hard to support you anyway.

Character 1: I was actually drowning. Alone.

184 Character 2: That's... [sigh] okay, I get that you're hurt. I do. And maybe—maybe I should've pushed through it somehow, I dunno. But I'm also disappointed that after everything, you can't see that I was doing my best. Even if my best wasn't enough.

Script: e78500dc_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. It went through.

185 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what went through? Are you talking about the—oh my god, the patent? Did you actually get the patent?!

Character 1: Yesterday. Got the letter.

186 Character 2: Are you—holy shit, are you serious right now? That's like... that's literally life-changing! I mean, you've been working on this for what, three years? [Gasp] Oh my god, we gotta celebrate!

Character 1: Three and a half. But yeah.

187 Character 2: Three and a—okay but like, do you realize how huge this is? You're gonna be like, an actual inventor now. Like officially. With paperwork and everything!

Character 1: I guess. Still feels weird.

188 Character 2: Weird? Babe, no no no, this is—I mean, okay yeah, I get it must be kinda surreal but like... you did this. You actually pulled it off, y'know?

Character 1: Haven't told my parents yet.

189 Character 2: Oh man, they're gonna—wait, are you nervous about telling them? Because honestly, after all that crap they said about you wasting time in the garage? [Chuckle] This is gonna be so good.

Character 1: They said I should get a real job. This technically isn't one.

190 Character 2: Okay but—but it could be, right? Like, now that it's patented you can actually, I dunno, sell it or license it or whatever inventors do?

Character 1: Maybe. There's interest from two companies.

191 Character 2: There's—hold up, there's already interest? And you're just casually mentioning this now like it's nothing? [Laugh] You're literally the worst at sharing good news, you know that?

Character 1: Don't want to jinx it.

192 Character 2: No no, I totally get that, but like—can you at least tell me which companies? Are we talking big ones or like, startups or what?

Character 1: One's pretty big. The one that makes those smart thermostats.

193 Character 2: The—oh my god, you mean like, the fancy ones everyone has? That's... okay that's actually insane. How are you being so calm about this right now?

Character 1: I'm not. Just good at looking like I am.

194 Character 2: Yeah, no, I can—I can actually see your hand shaking a little bit. [Softer] Hey, this is gonna change everything for you, huh? Like, in the best way possible.

Script: 40787f01_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I heard about you and Jamie.

195 Character 2: Oh god—okay, I was gonna tell you, I swear I was gonna tell you. It just—it happened so fast and I didn't know how to bring it up, y'know?

Character 1: How long?

196 Character 2: Um, like two weeks? Maybe three? But wait wait wait—before you get mad, we didn't plan it or anything. We just ran into each other at that party and—actually no, that sounds worse. [nervous laugh] Let me start over.

Character 1: Three weeks. You've been lying to me for three weeks.

197 Character 2: No no no, not lying! I just—I hadn't found the right time to tell you. Which I realize now was stupid because there's literally never gonna be a right time for "hey I'm hooking up with your ex," right?

Character 1: You knew how I'd feel about it.

198 Character 2: I did. I mean, of course I did, that's why I—god, I'm such an idiot. I kept telling myself it wasn't a big deal because you guys have been broken up for like six months, but that's not—that doesn't make it okay. [sigh] I know that.

Character 1: Six months isn't that long.

199 Character 2: You're right, you're totally right. And honestly? I wasn't even thinking about—okay that's a lie, I was definitely thinking about how you'd react. I just kinda... convinced myself you wouldn't care as much as you obviously do.

Character 1: Why Jamie? Of all people.

200 Character 2: I don't—I dunno, it just happened? We were both drunk and talking about work stuff and then suddenly we were—um. Yeah. But then we kept texting and it turned into this whole thing that I never expected.

Character 1: Do you actually like them or was this just about hurting me?

201 Character 2: What? No! God no, I would never—this was never about you. I mean, obviously it affects you, but I didn't do this to hurt you. I actually really do like them. Like, a lot. Which makes this so much worse because I want to be happy but I also just completely betrayed my best friend and I—[groan] I'm handling this so badly.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

202 Character 2: I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I should've—the second I realized there was something between us, I should've come to you. That would've been the right thing to do, y'know? Instead of being a coward about it.

Character 1: I need some time to process this.

203 Character 2: Yeah, no, totally. Take all the time you need. I just—can we eventually talk about this? Like actually talk? Because I can't lose you over this. You're literally one of the most important people in my life and if I have to choose—

Character 1: Don't. Just... give me space. We'll talk when I'm ready.

204 Character 2: Okay. Yeah, okay. I'll—I'll wait. And again, I'm so sorry. I know that doesn't fix anything but... I really am sorry.

Script: c166d4c6_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Wow. So we're strangers now?

205 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's not what happened. I wasn't pretending not to know you, I just... I didn't know how to introduce you to my boss and everyone. It was awkward.

Character 1: Right. Awkward.

206 Character 2: Look look, I know how it seemed, but you literally showed up out of nowhere and I was in the middle of this whole—they were talking about promotions. [frustrated laugh] I panicked, okay?

Character 1: You walked right past me.

207 Character 2: I didn't walk past—I mean, I kinda did, but I was gonna circle back. You're acting like I planned this whole thing to humiliate you or something.

Character 1: Sure felt like it.

208 Character 2: Come on, that's—you know that's not fair. These people, they're... they're different, okay? They judge everything. Who you know, where you hang out, literally everything matters with them. I'm not saying I handled it right, but [sigh] you don't get what it's like.

Character 1: So I'm embarrassing?

209 Character 2: No! God, no, that's not what I'm—why are you twisting this? You're not embarrassing, the situation was just... complicated. I didn't wanna explain our whole history to them right there.

Character 1: Our whole history. Ten years.

210 Character 2: Yeah, and those ten years mean something to me too, obviously. But you're not—look, you're not being fair either. You show up at my work thing wearing that shirt with all the holes and—okay okay, that came out wrong.

Character 1: No, keep going. This is great.

211 Character 2: That's not what I meant and you know it. I just—these work people, they're judgmental assholes, honestly. And I'm trying to get promoted, and I didn't know how to... [groan] merge those two worlds right then.

Character 1: You could've waved. Acknowledged I exist.

212 Character 2: You're right. You're right, I should've—I dunno, done something. But I froze, okay? And now you're acting like I'm this terrible person when really I just... I messed up. Can't we just—

Character 1: Just what?

213 Character 2: Move past this? I mean, seriously, one awkward moment and you're ready to throw away everything? That's kinda harsh, don't you think?

Character 1: You literally pretended I was invisible.

214 Character 2: And I'm sorry about—no, actually? I'm sorry-ish. Because yeah, I handled it badly, but you could also try to understand that my job is... it's complicated. And maybe—maybe you coulda just let it go instead of making this whole thing into some huge betrayal.

Script: de0f4187_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You missed it. Again.

215 Character 2: I know, I know, I'm—look, I tried to make it work, okay? I really did. But then Jamie needed help moving and I'd already promised weeks ago, and I thought I could do both but—

Character 1: You always think you can do both.

216 Character 2: That's not—okay, that's kinda true, but it's not like I'm trying to let you down. I just... I dunno, people need things and I wanna help. Is that really so terrible?

Character 1: It is when I'm always the one who gets canceled on.

217 Character 2: Come on, that's—you're being dramatic. It's not always you. [Sigh] And honestly? Sometimes it feels like you expect me to drop everything for you when I've got like, a million other commitments I made first.

Character 1: Then stop making a million commitments.

218 Character 2: Oh, okay, so I should just—what, tell everyone no? That's your solution? Look look, I get that you're mad, but you don't understand how hard it is when people are literally counting on me.

Character 1: I was counting on you.

219 Character 2: And I'm sorry about that, I am, but—[frustrated laugh]—you're acting like I do this to hurt you on purpose. Like I wake up thinking "how can I disappoint my friend today?" That's not what happens.

Character 1: No. You just forget I exist.

220 Character 2: That's—wow. That's really unfair. I don't forget you exist, I just... sometimes I overestimate what I can handle, okay? And yeah yeah, maybe I should say no more, but it's not that simple.

Character 1: It literally is that simple.

221 Character 2: No, it's not! You don't—ugh, you don't get it. When someone's like, desperate for help, I can't just be like "sorry, no." That's not who I am. And honestly? I thought you'd understand that about me by now.

Character 1: I understand you'd rather help strangers than show up for me.

222 Character 2: Strangers? Seriously? Jamie's not a stranger, they're—whatever. You know what? I'm trying to explain myself here and you're just... you're not even listening. You've already decided I'm the worst friend ever.

Character 1: Prove me wrong then.

223 Character 2: I'm—[scoff] how am I supposed to prove anything when you're like this? I messed up, fine, but I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I'm some terrible person because I tried to help too many people at once.

Character 1: Right. You're the hero. I forgot.

224 Character 2: That's not what I—you know what? Fine. Be mad. But maybe, just maybe, consider that I'm drowning here too, trying to keep everyone happy, and yeah, I failed today. But at least I'm trying.

Script: 74be7915_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So. I graduated last week.

225 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? You graduated? Like, officially done done? Oh my god, why didn't you—I mean, this is huge! Years of night school and you're just casually mentioning it now?

Character 1: Yeah. Done. No more Tuesday-Thursday hell schedule.

226 Character 2: I'm literally—okay, I'm getting emotional here because like, do you even realize how insane this is? Working full-time and then dragging yourself to class until what, ten at night? [Laugh] You're basically superhuman.

Character 1: Barely passed statistics.

227 Character 2: Oh no no no, don't do that. Don't minimize this. You passed—that's what matters. God, remember when you were like, studying in your car during lunch breaks? That was—I mean, I honestly don't know how you didn't lose it.

Character 1: Almost did. Winter semester nearly broke me.

228 Character 2: That professor, right? The one who—ugh, what was his name? Actually, y'know what, doesn't matter. He's in your rearview now. [Sigh] How does it feel though? Like, really?

Character 1: Strange. Keep thinking I'm forgetting an assignment.

229 Character 2: Oh that's so—okay that's weirdly sad but also kinda funny? Like your brain hasn't caught up yet. What're you gonna do with all your Tuesday nights now?

Character 1: Sleep. Maybe watch TV like a normal person.

230 Character 2: TV! Actual leisure time! Revolutionary concept, honestly. But like—okay, real talk, are you proud of yourself? Because you should be. You really, really should be.

Character 1: I don't know. Maybe. Ask me in a month.

231 Character 2: A month, okay okay, I'll—I'll give you that. But um, we're celebrating, right? Like, this isn't negotiable. I'm thinking dinner, drinks, the whole thing.

Character 1: My mom wants to throw a party. Kill me.

232 Character 2: [Gasp] Stop it—that's adorable! She's probably been waiting for this longer than you have. Let her have her moment, y'know? She watched you struggle through all of it.

Character 1: Fine. Small party. Very small.

233 Character 2: Small, got it. But I'm definitely making a speech. Don't even—don't look at me like that, I'm gonna cry and everything. It'll be embarrassing for both of us, it's gonna be great.

Character 1: Please don't.

234 Character 2: Too late, already writing it in my head. Something about perseverance and—oh! Remember that time you literally fell asleep standing up at my birthday? [Chuckle] Yeah, that's going in there for sure.

235 SCENARIO: trying to remember the word that's on the tip of their tongue

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, what is— what is that word? It's, um, it's right there, I can literally feel it, like, sitting right on my— on my tongue and I just, uh, I just can't get it out. This is so, um, so annoying.

[slightly strained]

It's the thing, you know, when you're, uh— when you're really tired but you can't sleep? Like your body's exhausted but your brain is still, um, still going and going and— [tsk] come on, what is it?

[more animated]

It starts with an I, I think? Or maybe— no, wait, maybe it's an E? Insomnia! No, that's not— that's not right, that's different. That's when you, uh, when you actually can't sleep, but this is more like—

[frustrated but focused]

Okay, okay, let me think. It's like when you're wired? But tired? Your eyes are heavy but you're still, um, you're still buzzing with energy and— [groan] this is driving me crazy.

[brightening]

Oh! Overtired! That's— no, wait, that's not quite— [pause] Oh my god, restless! No, that's not— [sigh]

[triumphant but quiet]

Wired. I'm just wired. That's, um— that's probably close enough, right? Sometimes your brain just, uh, just settles for good enough.

Script: 48f88a91 | Role: Character 1 (A)

236 Character 1: [breathlessly] Oh my God, is that what I think it is?! [voice rising] Let me see your hand—no, wait, is this real? [Squeals] This is actually happening right now, and I can't believe you didn't tell me immediately!

Character 2: [giggling uncontrollably] I know, I know! [voice trembling with joy] He proposed last night at the botanical gardens, right by the fountain where we had our first kiss. [whispers] I wanted to tell you in person, not over the phone.

237 Character 1: [shouting] The botanical gardens! [voice cracking] That's so perfect I could cry—actually, I am crying! [Gasps] Look at the size of that diamond! How did you keep this secret for an entire night without exploding?

Character 2: [through tears] I barely slept! [increasingly giddy] I kept staring at it with my phone flashlight, taking pictures from every angle. [softer] Mom's going to absolutely lose her mind when she sees this—should we call her right now?

238 Character 1: [shakily] We have to plan everything! [speaking rapidly] The dress, the venue, the flowers—oh my God, I'm going to be your maid of honor, right? [pleading tone] Please say yes or I'll literally die on this kitchen floor.

Character 2: [warmly] Of course you are! [voice breaking] Who else would I want standing next to me? [Sniffles] We've been planning our weddings since we were seven with those plastic tiaras—this time it's real diamonds and actual cake!

239 Character 1: [dreamily] Remember our wedding binders? [Laughs] They're still in Mom's attic with all those magazine clippings. [more excitedly] We thought we'd marry princes who'd arrive on white horses, not Dave from accounting with his Toyota!

Character 2: [defensively sweet] Hey, Dave from accounting turned out pretty amazing! [teasingly] He writes me poetry on sticky notes and leaves them in my lunch. [voice dropping] Plus, he looks incredible in a suit—wait until you see him as a groom.

240 Character 1: [quietly awed] I'm so happy for you. [voice swelling] You deserve every single beautiful moment of this. [Shaky breath] When you walk down that aisle, I promise I'll try not to sob louder than the music plays.

Character 2: [gently] You better not upstage me! [mock sternly] But seriously, I can't imagine doing any of this without you. [whispers emotionally] We're really grown up now, aren't we? Like, this is actually our real adult lives happening.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: be7183b0 | Role: Character 1 (A)

241 Character 1: [trembling] Is that—is that really you? [voice breaking] I thought everyone was gone, I thought I was the only one left! [Sobbing gasp] Please tell me this isn't another hallucination from the radiation.

Character 2: [hoarse whisper] It's me, it's really me! [louder, desperate] I've been searching for weeks—the entire city is rubble. [Choked sob] When I saw movement, I couldn't believe my eyes weren't playing tricks again.

242 Character 1: [quivering] Your face, you're so thin. [more urgently] How long since you've eaten? [Shaky breath] I have some canned peaches in my pack, they're from before everything went dark.

Character 2: [exhausted] Three days, maybe four—time doesn't mean anything anymore. [bitter laugh] Remember when we used to complain about traffic? [voice cracking] Now there's nothing but empty cars and silence everywhere.

243 Character 1: [fierce whisper] Don't talk like that. [stronger] We're alive, we found each other against impossible odds! [Gasping cry] That has to mean something, that has to mean we're supposed to survive this nightmare.

Character 2: [hollow tone] The shelter on Fifth Street collapsed yesterday. [more quietly] I watched it happen, heard the screams fade into nothing. [Shuddering breath] But seeing you here, actually breathing—maybe hope isn't completely dead.

244 Character 1: [frantically] We need to move north before the second wave hits. [steadier] There's a group gathering supplies near the old hospital. [soft sob] They have medicine, clean water—things we only dreamed about finding.

Character 2: [suspicious] How do you know they won't turn us away? [weary] Trust died with the government broadcasts. [Bitter chuckle] But I suppose following you beats wandering alone through this wasteland until I drop.

245 Character 1: [pleading] Because I've already been there, they took in children! [voice rising] Children who lost everything, just like us. [Whimpering] Please, just trust me one more time, like you used to before the world ended.

Character 2: [resigned sigh] The children made it? [warmer] That changes things—if kids can survive, maybe we're not completely doomed. [Soft laugh] Lead the way, just like old times when you'd drag me on adventures.

246 Character 1: [nostalgic whisper] Remember that camping trip where we got lost for six hours? [laughing through tears] You said we'd never survive the wilderness. [Snorting] Look at us now, actual apocalypse survivors finding each other.

Character 2: [wistful] That was just two years ago, feels like another lifetime entirely. [quietly amazed] Who knew those survival skills would actually matter? [Deep breath] At least this time we're lost together in hell.

247 Character 1: [determined] Hey, no more hell talk, okay? [gentler] We're going to make it through this because we have each other now. [Shaky inhale] Two people means shared watch duties, shared hope, shared tomorrow.

Character 2: [emotional] You still sound like the optimist I remember. [voice breaking] God, I missed having someone who refuses to give up. [Crying laugh] Fine, let's go find this miraculous shelter with medicine and children.

248 Character 1: [urgent whisper] Wait, do you hear that? [more anxiously] There's movement in the building behind you—we should go now. [Panicked breath] Grab my hand and don't let go no matter what happens next.

Character 2: [terrified] Not the infected ones, please not them! [whimpering] I can't run much further, my legs are already shaking. [Desperate sob] But I'd rather die running with you than alone and still.

249 Character 1: [commanding] It's just debris falling, breathe! [soothing] The infected don't come out until dusk, we have time. [Relieved sigh] See? Just the wind knocking things over, like it always does now.

Character 2: [embarrassed laugh] Sorry, I jump at every shadow these days. [steadying] You always were the brave one between us. [Quiet admission] I probably wouldn't have lasted this long without remembering your stupid courage speeches.

250 Character 1: [tender] Those speeches kept me going too, even when I was alone. [firm resolve] We're writing a new one together now. [Tearful smile in voice] Chapter one: two friends refuse to let the world end.

Character 2: [grateful whisper] I love you, you know that? [stronger] Not romantically, just—you're my family now, my only family. [Breaking down] Let's go find that shelter and start whatever comes after the end.

--- CS ALPHANUMERIC ---

Script: 1c326621 | Role: Character 1

251 Character 1: [nervously] Hi, um, I'm calling about setting up a wallet? [clears throat] I've been trying to, to figure this out for like three hours now, and [frustrated sigh] nothing makes sense on your website.

Customer Support: D2: [professionally] Good afternoon, I'd be happy to help you with that. [reassuring tone] First, can you provide me your account number? [more slowly] It should be an eight-digit code starting with K7.

252 Character 1: [shuffling] Oh, yeah, it's K7-4923-881. [pause] Wait, no, sorry—[embarrassed] that's 882 at the end, not 881.

Customer Support: D4: [typing sounds implied but not stated] Perfect, Mr. Chen, I see your account here. [helpful tone] Now, are you looking for a hot wallet or cold storage solution? [more patiently] Both have different security levels and, well, accessibility features.

253 Character 1: [confused] I don't—what's the difference? [increasingly worried] Someone on Reddit said I need a seed phrase with like 24 words? [exhales sharply] Is that the cold one?

Customer Support: D6: [calmly] Both wallet types use seed phrases, actually. [educational tone] Your hot wallet stays connected online for trading, while cold storage—[emphasizing] that's completely offline, much safer for long-term holdings.

254 Character 1: [overwhelmed] Okay, okay, so if I want to move my, um, 0.043 Bitcoin—[hesitant] is that even enough to worry about? [self-deprecating chuckle] I bought it at $47,000, so...

Customer Support: D8: [sympathetically] Any amount deserves proper security, sir. [more encouragingly] Now, to generate your wallet, you'll need to verify through 2FA first. [routine tone] Did you receive the six-digit code we just sent to your phone?

255 Character 1: [frantically] Let me check—yeah, it's 839-264. [suspicious] Wait, this is legitimate right? [nervous laugh] You're not one of those scammers?

Customer Support: D10: [slightly amused] I assure you, this is official support. [professional] Never share that code with anyone claiming to be us through email or text though. [warning tone] Now, for your wallet address, you'll receive a string starting with bc1q—[carefully] that's lowercase B-C-one-Q.

256 Character 1: [relieved] Oh good, good. [muttering] Let me write this down... bc1q... [confused again] How many characters is this thing supposed to be?

Customer Support: D12: [patiently] Your Bitcoin address will be 42 characters total. [informative] It'll look something like bc1q-x-r-p-7 and then a long string—[slowly] completely random letters and numbers, no patterns.

257 Character 1: [frustrated groan] This is so complicated! [pleading] Can't you just, I don't know, send it to my email at jchen.crypto@gmail—[catches himself] wait, that's probably not secure, is it?

Customer Support: D14: [firmly] Definitely not through regular email, no. [more seriously] Your wallet information should never be shared that way. [reassuring again] But don't worry, once you set this up, it becomes second nature.

258 Character 1: [sighs deeply] Alright, so after I get this bc1q address thing, [tentatively] I can finally move my coins off your exchange? [hopefully] And they'll be safe in my own wallet?

Customer Support: D16: [confidently] Exactly right. [helpful] You'll initiate the transfer from your dashboard, enter your wallet address—[important tone] double-check it twice—and confirm with your 2FA code again. The network fee is currently 0.00012 BTC.

259 Character 1: [shocked] Wait, that's like—[calculating] six dollars just to move it? [disappointed] Man, I remember when fees were like fifty cents back in 2017.

Customer Support: D18: [understanding] Network congestion does affect fees, yes. [informatively] You could wait for off-peak hours, usually Sunday mornings around 3 AM EST, [helpful whisper] fees typically drop by about 40% then.

260 Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll try Sunday then. [muttering] My wife's gonna kill me when she finds out I'm waking up at 3 AM for crypto. [nervous chuckle] Thanks for your help though, really.

Customer Support: D20: [warmly] You're very welcome, Mr. Chen. [professional closing] Your ticket reference is TK-88934-X if you need further assistance. [cheerful] Have a great day, and welcome to self-custody!

Script: 059c487e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] My financial aid still hasn't been applied to my account, and classes start tomorrow. [getting louder] I've been calling for three weeks—three weeks!—and [groans] nobody can tell me what's happening with my money.

261 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration with this situation. [speaking quickly] Let me pull up your account right away and see what's causing the delay. [reassuring] Can you provide me your student ID number?

Character 1: [exasperated] It's 4-4-7-8-9-2. [sighs heavily] Look, I've already given this information to, like, five different people, and [more desperately] they all say the same thing—"we're processing it."

262 Customer Support: Okay, I see here that your FAFSA was received but there's a verification hold. [more quickly] Did you submit your tax documents and the, um, the verification worksheet we sent on January 15th?

Character 1: [confused] Wait, what worksheet? [panic rising] Nobody told me about any worksheet! [voice breaking] Are you seriously telling me I might lose my classes because of paperwork nobody mentioned?

263 Customer Support: [calmly] No, no, you won't lose your classes. We can do an emergency deferment today to protect your enrollment while we sort this out. The worksheet was sent to your school email—do you check that regularly?

Character 1: [defensively] I check my personal email because that's what I put on everything. [groans] Why would you send critical financial documents to an email I don't even have yet? [sarcastically] That makes perfect sense.

264 Customer Support: I understand the confusion, and you're right, it's not ideal. Let me just—okay, I'm sending that worksheet to your personal email right now. Can you fill it out and upload it today?

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Today? [voice shaking] I'm at work until eight, and I don't even know where my parents' tax stuff is. [pleading] Can't you just... process what you have?

265 Customer Support: Unfortunately, federal regulations require this verification for about thirty percent of students. But here's what I can do—I'll extend the deferment deadline to Friday, giving you time to gather everything. Would that help?

Character 1: [relieved] Yes, God, thank you. [more calmly] So if I submit everything by Friday, when would the aid actually hit my account? [cautiously] Because rent is due soon and I'm counting on that refund.

266 Customer Support: Once we receive your documents, processing typically takes 3-5 business days. So if you submit Friday, you're looking at the following Wednesday or Thursday. [helpfully] We can also set up a payment plan for any immediate needs.

Character 1: [tiredly] A payment plan for money that's already mine—that's just... [sighs] Whatever, fine. [more firmly] But can you guarantee this won't happen next semester?

267 Customer Support: [confidently] Once you're verified this time, you're good for the entire academic year. [speaking rapidly] I'm also putting a note in your file to flag you for priority processing next year. [brightly] That should prevent future delays.

Character 1: [skeptically] Priority processing—is that actually a thing or are you just trying to make me feel better? [chuckles dryly] Because I've heard a lot of promises from this office that haven't exactly panned out.

268 Customer Support: No, it's definitely real—it puts you in a faster queue. Look, I know we've dropped the ball here, and I'm genuinely sorry about that. Is there anything else I can help with today?

Character 1: [resigned] Just... make sure that deferment goes through, please. [anxiously] I can't afford to lose my classes over this, I'm already a semester behind. [quietly] This whole system is just exhausting.

269 Customer Support: [reassuringly] The deferment is already applied—you should see it in your portal within the hour. I've also sent you my direct extension, so call me personally if there are any issues. [warmly] We'll get this sorted out.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh, your direct line? [more hopefully] That's actually... really helpful, thank you. [sighs] Sorry for getting upset earlier, I know it's not your fault personally.

270 Customer Support: No apology needed—I'd be frustrated too. [quickly] Just remember to check that school email going forward, and get those documents in by Friday. You're all set for now, and good luck with your classes tomorrow!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

271 [Disappointed] I mean, honestly, why am I always the one who has to, like, remember where we parked? [Sigh] It's exhausting.

272 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just—let me handle everything while you guys have fun. [Tsk] That's totally fair, right?

273 [Fast] Okay so we gotta leave in ten minutes, everybody needs their IDs, and I already called the Uber—wait, where's Marcus? [Groan]

274 [Happy] You know what? I actually kinda like being the mom friend sometimes. [Laugh] Someone's gotta keep you idiots alive!

275 [Whisper] They're all passed out and I'm just sitting here making sure nobody, um, chokes on their own vomit or whatever. [Slow] This is my Friday night.

276 [Angry] I'm not your personal assistant, okay? [Shout] Figure out your own damn ride home for once!

277 [Sad] Sometimes I just wanna be the messy one, y'know? Like, just once let me be the disaster. [Sigh]

278 [Slow] Every single time we go out, it's me who ends up—actually, forget it. [Disappointed] [Tsk] You wouldn't understand anyway.

279 [Fast] [Happy] Wait wait wait, I brought extra phone chargers for everyone! [Chuckle] See? This is why you need me!

280 [Sarcastic] Nobody ever asks if I wanna do shots, but everyone suddenly knows my name when they need a designated driver. [Disappointed] Funny how that works, huh?

281 [Angry] I literally sent fifteen reminders about this deadline and you're just now—are you seriously just now starting? [Groan] Unbelievable.

282 [Whisper] [Sad] I'm so tired of being the only adult in the room, but I can't just... I can't stop, can I?

283 [Chuckle] You guys would basically die without me and we all know it. [Happy] [Fast] Remember last week when nobody brought water to the hike?

284 [Slow] [Disappointed] I guess I'll just, um, cancel my plans again to deal with your emergency. [Sigh] Third time this month.

285 [Shout] How do none of you have the venue address? [Angry] [Fast] The event is literally starting and I'm the only one who knows where we're going!

286 [Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh no, please, don't worry about paying me back for those tickets I bought six months ago. [Tsk] I love being everyone's personal bank.

287 [Happy] Actually, being the responsible one means I get to pick the restaurant every time 'cause nobody else makes reservations! [Laugh] [Fast] Silver lining, right?

288 [Sad] Do you guys even notice when I'm not—when I don't show up? [Whisper] Or am I just, like, the human calendar app to you?

289 [Disappointed] I'm twenty-three years old and I'm literally making grocery lists for grown adults who can't feed themselves. [Groan] [Slow] This isn't what I signed up for.

290 [Fast] [Angry] Nobody brought sunscreen, nobody checked the weather, and somehow—somehow I'm the buzzkill for pointing this out? [Sarcastic] Yeah, okay, that makes total sense!

This must be read out in a single delivery as one file

291 SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a thing they assumed was covered by insurance, then checking the policy, then finding it's explicitly not covered, ending in insurance gap panic

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, so, um— so I had this whole thing today with my, uh, my bike. I was riding to work and this car just— [scoff] this car totally sideswiped me, you know? Like, uh, clipped my handlebar and I went down pretty hard.

[matter-of-fact]

But it's fine, it's— the guy was super apologetic, we exchanged info, the whole thing. My bike's pretty banged up though, like the, um, the wheel is completely warped and the, uh, the frame might be cracked? I don't know, it's, uh, it's pretty bad.

[conversational]

But whatever, right? That's what insurance is for. I mean, I've got renters insurance and I'm pretty sure that covers, um, personal property and stuff. Like bikes and— and things like that, you know?

[slight concern]

So I'm, uh, I'm looking at my policy right now actually, just to— just to see what the, um, the process is for filing a claim and... [pause] Wait. Hang on.

[growing worry]

Um, okay so it says here "bicycles are covered up to"— no wait, that's— [frustrated sigh] that's under exclusions. It specifically says, uh, "damage to bicycles while in transport is not covered."

[panic building]

Wait, what? No, no, no— that can't be right. I pay, um, I pay like sixty bucks a month for this and my bike was— [sharp exhale] my bike was eight hundred dollars! How is that not— how is transportation not covered?!

[full panic]

Oh my god, I'm completely screwed! I can't— I can't afford to replace this thing and I need it to get to work and— [groaning] why didn't I check this before?! What am I supposed to do now?!
