Character 1: It worked.

929 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what worked? Oh my god, is this about the—the sourdough thing? Because I swear you've been trying for like, what, three weeks now?

Character 1: Five weeks. But yeah. It finally bubbled.

930 Character 2: Five—okay that's actually dedication though. I would've given up after like, day three? Maybe day two. [Laugh] So it's actually alive now? Like, legitimately alive?

Character 1: Apparently. Smells like death though.

931 Character 2: That's—wait, isn't that kinda the point? I mean, fermentation is basically just controlled rot, right? Or—no that sounds wrong. But you know what I mean.

Character 1: I named it.

932 Character 2: You named—oh my god, of course you did. Okay okay, I gotta know. What's—what's its name? Please tell me it's something ridiculous.

Character 1: Brad.

933 Character 2: Brad. Your sourdough starter is named Brad. [Chuckle] That's so—I mean, honestly? That's perfect. Brad the bread. Wait, are you gonna make actual bread now?

Character 1: Tomorrow, maybe. If Brad cooperates.

934 Character 2: If Brad—okay I love that you're talking about it like it's a moody teenager or something. Which, I guess after five weeks of trying to get it to work, kinda makes sense?

Character 1: You want some? When I bake it?

935 Character 2: Are you—yes! Yes yes yes, obviously I want some! I've been hearing about this starter situation for literally over a month, I'm like, emotionally invested at this point.

Character 1: Cool. Might be terrible.

936 Character 2: Oh no no no, don't even—after all that work? It's gonna be amazing. And even if it's not, who cares? You made life! In a jar! That's—that's actually pretty wild when you think about it.

Character 1: It's just yeast.

937 Character 2: Just yeast? Babe, you've been babying this thing for five weeks straight. That's longer than most of my relationships. [Sigh] Brad is basically your child now.

Character 1: That's disturbing.

938 Character 2: I mean—yeah, okay, when I say it out loud like that it's kinda weird. But still! I'm really proud of you for sticking with it, y'know? Most people would've just bought bread.

Script: 755ae1ea_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You brought Jamie.

939 Character 2: I—okay, yes, but it's not like I had a choice. Everyone was gonna be there, and if I didn't invite them, it would've been this whole thing where people ask questions and—you know how our friends are.

Character 1: You could've told me.

940 Character 2: I was gonna tell you! I mean, I tried to text you like three times but I kept deleting it because—[sigh]—because I knew you'd react exactly like this. And honestly? We're all adults here.

Character 1: That's not the point.

941 Character 2: Then what is the point? Because from where I'm standing, you're asking me to basically pick sides in a breakup that happened months ago, and that's not—I can't do that. We're all in the same friend group.

Character 1: I'm not asking you to pick sides. I'm asking for a heads up.

942 Character 2: Okay okay, fine, you're right about that part. I should've warned you. But also like—you can't expect everyone to just exclude Jamie forever. They're still part of our circle whether you like it or not.

Character 1: At my birthday dinner?

943 Character 2: That was—[frustrated laugh]—okay that was not supposed to be your birthday dinner. It literally just turned into that because everyone happened to be free and someone mentioned it was your birthday week, so I—yeah. I get why you're pissed about that specifically.

Character 1: Do you?

944 Character 2: Yes, I do! But you're acting like I planned this whole ambush when really I'm just trying to keep everyone happy and—and maybe that's impossible, I dunno, but I'm not the villain here.

Character 1: Never said you were a villain. Just a shitty friend.

945 Character 2: Wow. That's—that's really unfair. I've been there for you through this entire breakup, literally held your hair back when you got wasted crying about them, and now I'm a shitty friend because I didn't wanna create drama? Come on.

Character 1: You created drama anyway.

946 Character 2: Because you're creating it! Jamie was fine, you were fine until you saw each other, and then suddenly—look, I'm sorry it was awkward, okay? But maybe, just maybe, you need to figure out how to exist in the same space sometimes.

Character 1: That's not your call to make.

947 Character 2: I'm not—I'm not making any calls! I'm literally just trying to have a normal friend group where people can hang out without it being this huge political thing every single time. [scoff] But apparently that makes me the bad guy.

Character 1: I need some space.

948 Character 2: Fine. Take your space. But just so we're clear—I'm not gonna apologize for staying friends with both of you. That's not fair to ask, and deep down? You know it's not.

Script: 93867155_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You think my problems aren't real problems.

949 Character 2: That's not—I never said that. I was just trying to, y'know, help you see things from a different angle. Like, isn't that what friends are supposed to do?

Character 1: By telling me other people have it worse?

950 Character 2: Okay okay, when you put it like that it sounds—[sigh] but that's not what I meant. I was literally just trying to help you feel better about the situation.

Character 1: That doesn't help.

951 Character 2: Well, I'm sorry, but I don't know what else to—I mean, you come to me with these things and I'm supposed to what, just agree that everything's terrible? That's not who I am.

Character 1: I wanted you to listen. Not fix.

952 Character 2: But that's—that's the thing though, you always say that, but then you keep talking about it like you want advice. It's kinda confusing, honestly. [frustrated laugh] I can't read your mind.

Character 1: I literally just needed someone to care.

953 Character 2: Oh come on, that's not fair. I do care—I wouldn't spend hours trying to help if I didn't care. You're making it sound like I'm some heartless person who just dismisses everything you say.

Character 1: You compared losing my job to your cousin's paper cut.

954 Character 2: What? No no no, that's—you're completely twisting what I said. I was talking about how my cousin bounced back from getting laid off, not—Jesus, you're really gonna make me the bad guy here?

Character 1: I'm not making you anything.

955 Character 2: Yeah, you kinda are though. Like, I get that you're upset, and maybe I didn't—[groan] maybe I could've been more sensitive or whatever, but you're acting like I did this on purpose.

Character 1: You do it every time.

956 Character 2: Every time? Seriously? That's—okay, if that's really how you feel, then why do you even talk to me about stuff? I mean, I'm obviously terrible at this, right?

Character 1: That's what I'm wondering.

957 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So we're—we're really going there. Look, I'm sorry if my way of trying to help isn't what you need, but I'm not gonna apologize for actually trying, y'know?

Character 1: Fine.

958 Character 2: Fine? That's it? [scoff] You know what, maybe—maybe we both need to figure out what we actually want from each other here, because this isn't working for either of us.

959 SCENARIO: noticing their gas tank is nearly empty

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh, come on. Come on, really? The, uh— the little light's on. Of course it is. Of course the gas light decides to, um, to come on right now when I'm already running late and—

[slightly exasperated]

Okay, so, um, how far can I actually go on empty? Like, I feel like I've heard different things about this. Some people say you can go, like, fifty miles? But that seems— that seems optimistic. Maybe that's just, uh, just wishful thinking.

[calculating]

Let me think, um, when did I last get gas? Was it Tuesday? Wednesday? [tsk] I should really pay more attention to this stuff. I mean, it's not like the gas tank is, uh, is a mystery. It's right there on the dashboard.

[resigned but practical]

Okay, so there's that Shell station on Fifth Street, and then there's the, um, the cheaper place by the grocery store, but that's kind of out of the way and if I'm really running on fumes here—

[decisive]

Right. Shell it is. I'll just, uh, I'll just deal with paying an extra ten cents per gallon. That's— that's the price of poor planning, I guess.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 22571582 | Role: Character 1 (A)

960 Character 1: [nervously] I'm actually trying to be good tonight. [quieter] Just a salad for me, please. [Deep breath] My doctor says I need to watch my cholesterol, and I've already lost five pounds this month.

Character 2: [dismissively] Oh come on, one night won't kill you! [enthusiastic] I'm ordering the cheese platter, garlic bread, and [getting louder] that incredible chocolate lava cake. [Snort] Life's too short to eat rabbit food.

961 Character 1: [firmly] That sounds amazing, but I'm sticking to my plan. [softer] Maybe just some grilled chicken with the salad? [Nervous laugh] I've been doing so well lately, I don't want to slip up now.

Character 2: [wheedling tone] But it's Friday! [faster] We always share the spinach artichoke dip on Fridays, remember? [Dramatic sigh] Plus, I can't eat all that bread alone—[pleading] you're making me look like a glutton here!

962 Character 1: [Uncomfortable chuckle] You're not a glutton. [more defensive] I just need to stay focused on my goals right now. [wavering] Maybe I could have one piece of bread? [quickly] No, no, I shouldn't even start.

Character 2: [sarcastically sweet] One piece of bread, how rebellious. [Scoff] Remember when we used to demolish entire pizzas together? [wistful] Those were the days. [sharper] Now you're all kale smoothies and counting almonds.

963 Character 1: [hurt] It's not like that. [steadier] I'm trying to be healthier, not punish myself. [Soft exhale] My energy levels are better, I sleep better—[brightening slightly] I even ran a 5K last weekend without stopping!

Character 2: [grudgingly impressed] Okay, that's actually pretty cool. [Pause] [more enthusiastic] But you're celebrating tonight, right? [coaxing] Winners deserve victory meals! [Giggle] Come on, split the pasta special with me—it's practically a marathon medal!

964 Character 1: [laughing] That's not how nutrition works! [more serious] Look, I appreciate you wanting to include me. [gentle] Why don't you get what you want, and [hopeful voice] I'll steal a bite of your dessert later?

Character 2: [triumphant] Aha! So you DO want dessert! [teasing] The diet fortress has a crack! [Cackle] I'm ordering two spoons for that lava cake. [smugly] Your willpower never stands a chance against melted chocolate.

965 Character 1: [exasperated] One bite doesn't mean I'm abandoning everything. [calmer] It's about balance, not deprivation. [Thoughtful hum] Actually, having a taste might stop me from binging later when I'm home alone with my cravings.

Character 2: [skeptical] Right, because one bite always stays one bite. [knowing tone] Remember the "one chip" incident at Sandra's party? [Loud laugh] You ate the entire bowl! [affectionately] Just admit you miss our food adventures together.

966 Character 1: [quietly] Of course I miss them. [more emotional] I miss not thinking about every calorie too. [Shaky breath] But I also missed fitting into my clothes and [stronger] feeling confident at the beach last summer.

Character 2: [softening] Hey, I didn't mean to make this heavy. [apologetic] You looked great then, you look great now. [Gentle sigh] I just—[trailing off] I guess I feel like we don't connect the same way anymore.

967 Character 1: [surprised] What? [warmly] Food isn't our only connection! [reassuring] We're here together, aren't we? [Chuckle] Besides, I can still appreciate your food stories—[playful] I just experience them vicariously through you now!

Character 2: [brightening] That's true! [excited again] Speaking of stories, wait till you hear about the sushi place I found. [mysteriously] They do this thing with torched salmon—[dreamily] it's basically butter that swims.

968 Character 1: [amused] See? This is perfect! [cheerful] You eat, you describe every flavor in detail. [Giggle] I'll live through your taste buds while [contentedly] enjoying my grilled chicken, which honestly sounds pretty good right now.

Character 2: [resigned laugh] Fine, you win with your reasonable compromise. [mock serious] But I'm still ordering that lava cake. [whispered conspiracy] And I'm leaving the spoons where [sing-song voice] you can reach them easily.

969 Character 1: [fake stern] You're terrible! [laughing harder] This is exactly why I needed dinner accountability—[grateful tone] but also why I love having meals with you. [tenderly] Thanks for understanding, even when you're being a total enabler.

Character 2: [proudly] Enabler is such a harsh word. [philosophical tone] I prefer "curator of life's pleasures." [Warm chuckle] Now let's order before I faint—[dramatically] your talk of vegetables is making me dizzy with hunger!

Script: b92de17e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Um, hi there... I just moved here from, uh, 2847 Maple Street, and [sighs heavily] my old carrier says my account number XJ-9902-K is expired? [in a dazed voice] I need a new plan but honestly, I can't even remember what I had before.

970 Customer Support: Welcome to TechConnect! Don't worry, we'll get you sorted out right away. Let me show you our three main plans—we've got Basic at $35, Premium at $65, and Ultimate at $95 per month.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Ninety-five dollars? [groans] That's... that's a lot. [slowly] My friend Sarah, she has account 77B-2341 with you guys, said she pays like, um, way less? [uncertain] Maybe forty-something?

971 Customer Support: She might have our Basic plan with a loyalty discount! After 12 months, customers get 15% off their base rate. Plus, if you port your number—do you know your current number?

Character 1: [frustrated sigh] It's 555-0847... no wait, [correcting himself] 555-0874. [exhausted] Sorry, I haven't slept much since the move. [quieter] What exactly comes with that Premium thing again?

972 Customer Support: The Premium plan includes unlimited talk, text, and 50GB of high-speed data. [more excitedly] You also get free international texting to 180 countries! Would you like me to check if promotional code SAVE25 still applies?

Character 1: [perking up slightly] International? [thoughtfully] My mom lives in Prague, postal code 110-00... [trails off tiredly] Yeah, check that code thing. [yawns] How much data did you say—fifty?

973 Customer Support: Yes, 50 gigabytes! Great news—SAVE25 is active through December 31st, bringing Premium down to $48.75. I'll need your driver's license number to run a credit check, whenever you're ready.

Character 1: [mumbling] License... license... [more clearly] It's D-4429-8876-2001. [confused again] Wait, is that with the dashes or... [sighs] Does the Basic plan have any international stuff at all?

974 Customer Support: Basic includes Canada and Mexico calling only, I'm afraid. [more optimistically] However, you could add International Plus for $12 monthly—that covers 75 countries including Czech Republic! Should I calculate that option for you?

Character 1: [calculating out loud] So thirty-five plus twelve... [groans softly] that's forty-seven, basically the same as Premium anyway. [defeated] My brain is just... fried right now. [quietly] What about contracts?

975 Customer Support: No contracts required on any plan! [more enthusiastically] You can change or cancel anytime with 30 days notice. I can also set up autopay with routing number 021000021 for an extra $5 discount.

Character 1: [slightly sarcastic] Of course there's another discount I have to remember. [sighs] You know what, let's just... [more decisively] let's do the Premium with that SAVE thing. [uncertain] That was forty-eight something?

976 Customer Support: Exactly $48.75 with code SAVE25! I'll need to verify your email for account setup. Also, would you like to keep your current number or get a new local one?

Character 1: [tiredly] Keep it, definitely keep it. [mumbling] Email is... dazedcustomer at... no, [correcting] jadams2023@webmail.net. [more alert] When would this actually start?

977 Customer Support: Service activates within 2-4 hours after setup! Your first bill dated January 15th will include a $35 activation fee. Should I email confirmation to that jadams address?

Character 1: [surprised] Activation fee? [groans loudly] Nobody mentioned that earlier. [resignedly] Fine, whatever, yes to the email. [confused] Do I need a new SIM card or something?

978 Customer Support: [apologetically] Yes, the activation is standard, sorry about that! I'll waive shipping on your SIM—normally $9.99—since you're signing up today. Can you confirm ZIP code 94102 for delivery?

Character 1: [slowly] No, that's the old one... [thinking] new ZIP is 94523. [exhausted chuckle] Apartment 4B if that matters. [quietly] This is way more complicated than I expected, honestly.

979 Customer Support: Moving is always overwhelming! But you're all set now—order number TM-8847-QZ confirmed. Your SIM arrives in 2-3 business days, and our support line 1-800-TECH is always here if you need help!

Script: 8275d1d0 | Role: Customer Support

980 Customer Support: Good afternoon, how can I help you today? [cheerfully] I see you were in last week for the, uh, transmission service.

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, about that—my car's still making the exact same grinding noise! [louder] I paid eight hundred dollars for nothing, apparently. [sighs heavily] You guys said it was definitely the transmission fluid.

981 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, sir. [quickly] Let me pull up your service record here and—oh, I see we did the full flush and filter replacement. The grinding is still happening?

Character 1: [exasperated] Every single time I brake! [sarcastically] But sure, the transmission fluid was the problem, right? [groans] My neighbor said it sounds like brake pads, which would've cost me what, fifty bucks?

982 Customer Support: Well, the symptoms you described last week did indicate transmission issues. But if it's happening during braking, that's—that's definitely different. [quickly] We can take another look, no charge for the diagnostic.

Character 1: [incredulous] No charge for the diagnostic? [louder] How generous, after I already paid for the wrong fix! [pause] [bitterly] My wife warned me about this place.

983 Customer Support: Sir, I assure you we diagnosed based on the information provided. However, we do stand behind our work, so let's—let's get this resolved today. Can you bring it in this afternoon?

Character 1: [skeptically] And what, pay another fortune for the actual problem? [sighs] I've already missed work for this twice. [demanding] I want to speak to whoever did the diagnosis last week.

984 Customer Support: [nervously] That would be, um, Jake, but he's off today. Look, I can personally guarantee we'll make this right—if it's the brakes, we'll credit the labor from last week toward the repair. [hopeful] Fair enough?

Character 1: [considering] Credit the labor... [more calmly] Fine, but I want everything in writing this time. [firmly] And if it's not the brakes either, we're going to have a bigger problem.

985 Customer Support: Absolutely, everything documented. I'll prep the paperwork now and have our senior tech, Marcus, look at it—he's got thirty years experience. We'll find the real issue.

Character 1: [resigned] Thirty years, huh? [chuckles dryly] Maybe should've had him look at it the first time. [pause] [tiredly] I'll be there at three.

986 Customer Support: Perfect, three o'clock works great. And sir, just so you know, if Marcus finds it was our error, we'll also throw in a free oil change for the inconvenience.

Character 1: [surprised] An oil change? [sarcastically] Wow, that almost makes up for the week of grinding terror on the highway. [sighs] Whatever, see you at three.

987 Customer Support: I really do understand your frustration. These things shouldn't happen, and we'll—we'll definitely review our diagnostic procedures after this. Thank you for giving us another chance.

Character 1: [softening slightly] Yeah, well... [pause] [quietly] Just fix it right this time, okay? My kids ride in that car.

988 Customer Support: We absolutely will, sir. Marcus will personally test drive it himself before and after any work. Your family's safety is our priority.

Character 1: [acknowledging] Alright, I appreciate that. [more calmly] And hey, if it really is just brake pads, maybe I overreacted a bit. [tiredly] This car's been nothing but problems lately.

989 Customer Support: Cars can be frustrating when multiple things go wrong. But we'll get to the bottom of it today, I promise. See you at three, Mr. Davidson.

Character 1: [resigned] Three o'clock. [pause] [quietly] And it's Henderson, not Davidson. [sighs] But yeah, see you then.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

990 [Slow] I don't even know what day it is anymore—Tuesday? [Groan] My brain feels like it's, uh, floating in soup or something.

991 [Angry] [Fast] Why is everyone being so loud when it's clearly the middle of the night—oh wait, it's noon, never mind.

992 [Happy] You know what, I'm actually kinda enjoying this weird twilight zone thing where breakfast feels like dinner! [Chuckle]

993 [Whisper] Is it just me or does the ceiling look really, really far away right now? [Sigh]

994 [Disappointed] I literally set seventeen alarms and still somehow missed the—wait, did I sleep through all of them? [Tsk]

995 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's schedule a meeting for 8 AM, that's perfect when my body thinks it's midnight. [Groan]

996 [Sad] [Slow] I just wanna sleep but my stupid brain won't, um, won't turn off, you know?

997 [Fast] Coffee isn't working, melatonin isn't working, I've tried everything and I'm still—ugh, forget it. [Angry] [Groan]

998 [Chuckle] Did I seriously just put toothpaste on my hairbrush? [Happy] This is getting ridiculous, honestly.

999 [Shout] Don't talk to me until I figure out what timezone my stomach is in! [Angry]

1000 [Slow] [Disappointed] The worst part is, like, knowing you're gonna crash hard in about three hours but there's nothing you can—yeah.

1001 [Whisper] [Sad] Everyone else is asleep and I'm just here, staring at the wall like some kind of, I dunno, zombie.

1002 [Sarcastic] My body's in New York but apparently my soul is still somewhere over the Pacific. [Tsk] [Sigh]

1003 [Fast] [Happy] Actually, being awake at 4 AM means no traffic, no lines at the store—it's kinda great!

1004 [Groan] Why does water taste weird when you're jet lagged, or is that just—am I imagining things now?

1005 [Angry] I've been home for three days and my sleep schedule is still completely—[Shout] this is insane!

1006 [Slow] You ever feel like your eyeballs are, um, vibrating? [Disappointed] Because that's where I'm at right now.

1007 [Chuckle] [Sarcastic] Yeah, let me just "power through" like everyone keeps suggesting—that's definitely how biology works.

1008 [Sad] I keep forgetting simple words and it's really—what's the word—frustrating, that's it. [Tsk]

1009 [Happy] [Fast] Okay but silver lining: I get to eat dinner twice today and nobody can judge me for it!

1010 SCENARIO: Upset about a missed opportunity, then a better one comes up while talking about it

==================================================

[dejected]

So I totally blew it today. Like, completely. You know that promotion I've been waiting for? The one in marketing that would finally get me out of this cubicle hell?

[frustrated]

Well, they posted it internally yesterday and applications were due by five today, and I— I just, I didn't see the email until like six-thirty because it went to my spam folder somehow. [groan] My spam folder! Of all the— I mean, who even checks that?

[bitter]

So now Jessica from accounting is probably gonna get it, and she's been here like half as long as me. I just— I can't believe I missed it because of a stupid technical glitch. I was literally refreshing my email all week waiting for that posting.

[defeated]

I'm just so tired of being stuck in the same position while everyone else moves up around me. Like, what's the point of even— 

[surprised]

Oh wait, hold on. My phone's buzzing... it's my boss? Why would she be calling me this late?

[curious] [hopeful]

She says— okay, she says there's actually a senior marketing position that just opened up at the downtown office. Better pay, better benefits, and she wants to fast-track my application because I've been "consistently overlooked." 

[amazed] [excited]

Um, that's like way better than the other job? I think— I think missing that deadline might have been the best thing that happened to me.
