Character 1: So. The clinic called this morning.

586 Character 2: Oh my god, oh my god—wait, and? What did they—I mean, I know you had the blood test thing on Monday, right? Tell me everything.

Character 1: It worked.

587 Character 2: It—wait, what? [Gasp] Are you saying—oh my god, are you actually pregnant right now? Like, right this second?

Character 1: Apparently. Yeah.

588 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry. No no no, I'm already crying. After everything you've been through, all those months of—god, how are you even feeling right now?

Character 1: I don't know. Scared, mostly.

589 Character 2: Okay, yeah, that's—that's totally normal though, right? I mean, this is huge. Like, you've wanted this for so long and now it's actually... happening. [Soft laugh] Your brain probably doesn't even know what to do.

Character 1: Three rounds of IVF. Three.

590 Character 2: I know, babe. I know. And you were so—I mean, after the second one didn't work, you were basically ready to give up, remember? But you didn't. You kept going.

Character 1: My mom cried when I told her. Full sobbing.

591 Character 2: Oh god, of course she did—she's been waiting for this almost as long as you have. Actually, no, scratch that, nobody's been waiting as long as you. This is—this is your moment, y'know?

Character 1: What if something goes wrong?

592 Character 2: Okay, hey—no no no, we're not doing that. [Sigh] I mean, I get it, I totally get why your brain's going there, but like... can we just sit with the good news for a minute? Just let it be good?

Character 1: You're right. Sorry. I'm being weird.

593 Character 2: You're not—stop, you're not being weird at all. You're being, like, incredibly human right now. After everything your body's been through? All those hormones and procedures and just... the hoping? You're allowed to feel whatever you're feeling.

Character 1: I bought a onesie. Two years ago. It's still in my closet.

594 Character 2: Wait, you—[Chuckle] oh my god, you never told me that. That's so... okay, that's actually breaking my heart a little bit. In the best way though, because now you're gonna—you're actually gonna need it.

Character 1: Yeah. Guess I will.

595 Character 2: Come here—I need to hug you right now. Like, immediately. This is the best news I've heard in... honestly? Maybe ever. I'm so freaking happy for you.

Script: 41dc8e99_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about something.

596 Character 2: Um, okay? That's—that's kind of ominous. What's going on? Did I do something wrong or...?

Character 1: When's the last time you texted me first?

597 Character 2: I—what? That's what this is about? Come on, you know I'm terrible at that stuff. I've been swamped with work and—okay okay, I get that's not an excuse, but seriously?

Character 1: Three months. That's how long.

598 Character 2: That can't be—[scoff] are you actually keeping track? Look, I respond when you text me, don't I? I show up when we make plans. I'm not like, ignoring you.

Character 1: You respond. That's the bar now?

599 Character 2: No, that's not—you're twisting what I'm saying. I care about this friendship, obviously, but you're acting like I don't just because I'm not great at reaching out first. That's kinda unfair.

Character 1: I'm always the one reaching out. Always.

600 Character 2: And I appreciate that, I do, but maybe—maybe you could've mentioned this before it became this huge thing? Instead of just... [frustrated laugh] sitting there resenting me for months?

Character 1: I figured you were busy.

601 Character 2: I am busy! That's—I mean, that's actually true. But okay, fine, I could've made more effort. I just didn't realize it was bothering you this much.

Character 1: Shouldn't have to tell you to care.

602 Character 2: Wow. That's—wow. I do care, and you know that. Or you should know that. Just because I don't text first doesn't mean I don't think about you or—this is ridiculous.

Character 1: Is it?

603 Character 2: Yeah, kinda! You're basically saying our entire friendship is one-sided, which—that's not true. I literally helped you move last month. I came to your thing when nobody else did. But sure, I'm a terrible friend.

Character 1: That's not what I said.

604 Character 2: It's what you're implying though. Look look, I get it—I should reach out more. [sigh] And I will, okay? But you gotta understand, it's not personal. I'm like this with everyone.

Character 1: That doesn't make it better.

605 Character 2: I—yeah. Yeah, you're right. It doesn't. I dunno what else to say here. I'm sorry I made you feel like you're not important to me, but I'm also kinda hurt that you think I don't care.

Script: d1b81a66_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: That joke you made at dinner. About my promotion.

606 Character 2: What? Oh come on, that was just—I was kidding around. Everyone was laughing, you were laughing too! I didn't think you'd actually be upset about it.

Character 1: Yeah. Hilarious.

607 Character 2: Okay okay, but like—you gotta understand, I genuinely didn't know it would bother you. We joke about everything, literally everything, and now suddenly this is off limits? [scoff] How was I supposed to know?

Character 1: Because it was personal.

608 Character 2: Personal? We've made way worse jokes about each other before! Remember when you called me a disaster at relationships for like, three months straight? But I can't make one comment about—fine, whatever.

Character 1: That was different and you know it.

609 Character 2: I don't—I really don't see how it's different. Look, I'm sorry it hurt your feelings, okay? But you're acting like I deliberately tried to [frustrated laugh] humiliate you or something, which is kinda unfair.

Character 1: You made me sound incompetent. In front of everyone.

610 Character 2: That's not—ugh, that's not what I was doing! I was making fun of the situation, not you. The whole nepotism thing is just—it's funny because it's obviously not true. Everyone knows you earned it.

Character 1: Do they?

611 Character 2: Yes! Of course they do! But now you're making me feel like the worst friend ever for what was literally just a dumb throwaway joke that I—I didn't think about it that hard, okay?

Character 1: That's the problem. You didn't think.

612 Character 2: Okay but—hold on, that's not fair either. I'm supposed to analyze every single thing I say now? We were all just having fun and I—look look, I get that it stung, but you could've just told me right then instead of giving me the silent treatment.

Character 1: Would you have listened?

613 Character 2: Um, yeah? Obviously? But instead you just sat there and let me think everything was fine when apparently [sigh] you were seething the whole time. That's kinda on you too, y'know?

Character 1: Don't turn this around on me.

614 Character 2: I'm not—I'm not turning it around, I'm just saying we both could've handled this better. And honestly? I'm a little disappointed that after all these years, you'd think I'd ever wanna actually hurt you.

Character 1: Intent doesn't erase impact.

615 Character 2: No, but it should at least count for something, right? Like—I dunno, maybe you could cut me some slack here since I clearly didn't mean it the way you took it? Just—whatever, forget it.

Script: a84d0914_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three months. It's been three months.

616 Character 2: I know, I know, I'm—god, I'm so sorry. I kept meaning to pay you back, I swear, but then my car broke down and—wait, that's not an excuse, I'm not trying to make excuses.

Character 1: Two hundred dollars.

617 Character 2: Yeah. Two hundred. Um, listen, I—I actually have some of it? Like, I have about eighty right now, and I can—I mean, I get paid next week so I can definitely get you more then. [nervous laugh] This is so embarrassing.

Character 1: You said two weeks. That was the deal.

618 Character 2: I did say that, didn't I? Shit. I really—I really thought I could do it, y'know? But then everything just kinda... fell apart. My hours got cut at work and I—no, wait wait, I'm doing it again. Making excuses.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

619 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right. I should've just—I should've told you, like, immediately when I knew I couldn't pay you back. Instead of just... avoiding it. Avoiding you, honestly. [sigh] That was really shitty of me.

Character 1: I had to ask your roommate if you were even alive.

620 Character 2: Oh god, really? That's—fuck, I'm the worst. I literally saw your texts and I just couldn't—I dunno, I panicked? Like every time I went to reply I just felt so guilty that I couldn't—that's so stupid, I know that's stupid.

Character 1: I would've understood if you'd just talked to me.

621 Character 2: I know. I know you would've, that's what makes this worse, right? Like, you're literally the most understanding person and I just—I was so ashamed, I guess. Still am, obviously. Really, really ashamed.

Character 1: I needed that money. I told you that.

622 Character 2: No no no, I remember. For your—for your rent, right? Did you—please tell me you didn't get in trouble with your landlord because of me. [groan] Please.

Character 1: I figured it out. No thanks to you.

623 Character 2: Okay so here's what I'm gonna do—I'm gonna give you the eighty now, and then, um, I can pick up some extra shifts. My manager said—actually, doesn't matter. Point is, I'll have the rest in two weeks. Actually two weeks this time.

Character 1: I've heard that before.

624 Character 2: Yeah, that's—that's fair. But I mean it this time, I swear. I'll literally set up like an automatic transfer or something so I can't chicken out again. Would that—would that be okay?

Character 1: Fine. But this can't happen again.

625 Character 2: It won't. Ever. I promise. And I—thank you for not just writing me off completely. I know I don't deserve it but... yeah. Thank you. I'm really, really sorry I put you through this.

Script: 2d4ae20d_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You didn't come.

626 Character 2: Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm so, so sorry. I literally had the worst night and I—wait, that's not an excuse, I just—

Character 1: Everyone asked where you were.

627 Character 2: No no no, please don't—I feel terrible already. I had it in my calendar and everything, I swear I did, but then my mom called and—[groan] okay that sounds so lame but she was having this whole crisis about my dad and I couldn't just leave her like that, you know?

Character 1: You could have texted.

628 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've—I meant to, honestly. I kept thinking "I gotta text them" but then my mom would start crying again and I'd have to—and then it was like midnight and I figured it was too late and you'd be even madder if I texted then.

Character 1: So you just said nothing instead.

629 Character 2: That was—yeah, that was stupid. Really stupid. [nervous laugh] I kinda just froze up, y'know? Like the longer I waited, the worse it got, and then I couldn't figure out what to even say that wouldn't sound like total BS.

Character 1: It was my birthday.

630 Character 2: I know. God, I know, and that makes it so much worse. I had your present wrapped and everything—it's still sitting on my kitchen counter actually, which is just... I'm literally the worst friend ever.

Character 1: Yeah. You kind of are.

631 Character 2: I wanna make it up to you. Like, seriously, whatever you want—dinner, drinks, I'll throw you another party myself, I don't care. Just please let me—let me try to fix this somehow?

Character 1: I don't want another party.

632 Character 2: Right, no, of course not. That's not—I didn't mean it like that. [sigh] I just... I really messed up and I don't know how to—like, what do you need from me? Because I'll do it. Whatever it is.

Character 1: I needed you to show up. That's literally all I wanted.

633 Character 2: I know. And I—I failed you. Completely. There's no excuse good enough, is there? Like nothing I say is gonna change that I wasn't there when you needed me to be.

Character 1: At least you get that.

634 Character 2: Can we—would you maybe wanna get coffee tomorrow? Or whenever you're ready, I mean. No pressure. I just... I miss you and I hate that I hurt you like this.

Character 1: Maybe. I need to think about it.

635 Character 2: Yeah, totally, take all the time you need. I'll—I'll wait. And um, for what it's worth... happy belated birthday. I really am sorry.

636 SCENARIO: discovering their headphones are dead

==================================================

[matter-of-fact]

Okay, so I'm just gonna— I'm gonna put my headphones on and, um, and get this whole thing started. Should be, uh, should be pretty straightforward, right?

[confused]

Huh. That's, um— that's weird. Nothing's happening. Like, literally nothing. I mean, they're connected, they're— wait, are they connected?

[muttering]

Let me just— okay, Bluetooth says connected, so that's not— that's not the issue. Maybe it's the, uh, the volume? No, volume's fine. This is— [sigh] this is so annoying.

[realization dawning]

Oh. Oh wait. When did I last— when did I last charge these? Because I feel like it was, um, it was like a week ago? Maybe more? [groan] Yeah, okay, they're definitely dead.

[resigned but slightly amused]

Cool. So I guess I'm just— I guess I'm gonna be listening to my own thoughts today instead of, uh, instead of literally anything else. Which is, you know, thrilling. [dry laugh] Really what I was hoping for.

[trailing off]

I should probably just— I should find the charger and plug them in, but knowing me I'll forget where I put that too, so...

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 08d624a3 | Role: Character 1 (A)

637 Character 1: [shaky voice] I got the job offer yesterday. [Deep breath] It's in Seattle—the position I've dreamed about for years. [voice breaking] But I can't imagine leaving you, leaving everything we've built here together since college.

Character 2: [stunned whisper] Seattle? That's... that's three thousand miles away. [voice cracking] When would you leave? [Choking sob] God, I knew this day might come, but I kept pushing it out of my mind completely.

638 Character 1: [through tears] They want me there by next month. [quivering] I haven't even said yes yet because every time I try, I picture your face. [Gasping breath] Remember when we promised we'd be each other's maids of honor?

Character 2: [bitter laugh] Of course I remember—we were drunk on cheap wine in your apartment. [more shakily] We planned our whole futures that night. [voice dropping] This wasn't supposed to happen until we were at least thirty-five, remember?

639 Character 1: [pleading tone] You could come with me! [desperately faster] There are tons of marketing jobs in Seattle, and we could get a place together like we always talked about. [Sniffling] Please, just think about it for a second.

Character 2: [firm but sad] My whole family is here, Sarah's here, my job... [trailing off] I can't just uproot everything. [Shuddering breath] But I can't ask you to give up your dream either. This is so unfair.

640 Character 1: [angry suddenly] Why does growing up have to mean growing apart? [louder] This is exactly what happened to my sister and her best friend! [Bitter sob] I swore I'd never let distance destroy us like that, ever.

Character 2: [gentle whisper] Hey, we're not them. [steadier] We've survived your terrible boyfriends, my parents' divorce, that whole disaster with the apartment flood. [warmly through tears] Geography can't break what we have—I won't let it destroy us.

641 Character 1: [laughing while crying] Remember when we got matching tattoos and swore we'd live next door forever? [nostalgic tone] God, we were so naive. [Hiccupping sob] I'm going to miss our Tuesday wine nights more than anything else.

Character 2: [determined] Then we'll have virtual wine nights. [building confidence] Every Tuesday, no exceptions, same terrible reality shows. [voice wavering] And I'll visit so often they'll think I live there. [Soft laugh] You're not getting rid of me.

642 Character 1: [relieved exhale] You really mean that? Even with the time difference and everything? [hopeful whisper] I've been so scared to tell you because I thought you'd hate me. [quickly] I've been carrying this secret for three days.

Character 2: [mock offended] Hate you? [more seriously] I could never hate you, you absolute idiot. [thick with emotion] I'm devastated and proud and terrified all at once. [Watery chuckle] But mostly I'm just going to miss your stupid face.

643 Character 1: [sobbing harder] Stop being so supportive, you're making this worse! [laughing through tears] I had a whole speech prepared about how we'd stay close. [softer] But you already know we will, don't you? You always know everything.

Character 2: [teasing weakly] Well, someone has to be the smart one. [more vulnerable] Promise me you won't replace me with some cool Seattle hipster. [trembling] I know they have better coffee there, but our friendship is irreplaceable, right?

644 Character 1: [incredulous] Replace you? [louder and firm] You're literally tattooed on my ankle, you weirdo! [dropping to whisper] No one else would understand our synchronized period cry sessions or our elaborate revenge plots. You're stuck with me forever, distance be damned.

Character 2: [breathless giggle] Good, because I already bought a plane ticket for your first weekend there. [matter-of-fact] Non-refundable. [Snorting laugh] I figured you'd need help decorating and someone to ugly-cry with while you unpack all our photos together.

645 Character 1: [overwhelmed] You already bought a ticket? [voice rising] Before I even accepted the job? [Soft sob] This is why I love you, you beautiful, presumptuous person. Of course you knew I'd take it before I did.

Character 2: [proudly sad] Someone had to push you toward your dreams when you're too scared. [quieter] That's what best friends do. [Long exhale] Plus, I needed something concrete to hold onto, proof that this isn't really goodbye forever.

646 Character 1: [whimpering] Come here, I need the biggest hug. [muffled against shoulder] We're going to make this work. [fiercely] Long distance friendship is nothing compared to what we've already survived. Seattle doesn't stand a chance against us, I promise.

Character 2: [crying freely] I'm going to miss you so much it physically hurts already. [stronger] But I'm also so ridiculously proud. [whispered promise] You're going to conquer that city, and I'll be cheering from here until I visit.

Script: 04e52571 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [mysteriously] The shadows on Highway 47 whispered my plate number wrong, [pause] or so they claim. [softer] Violation #TRL-892347-X speaks of a silver chariot, but mine sleeps in burgundy dreams.

647 Customer Support: [professionally] Thank you for contacting FastPass Support regarding violation notice TRL-892347-X. I'm, uh, having difficulty understanding your concern—are you disputing the vehicle color listed on your toll violation from Highway 47?

Character 1: [cryptically] The electronic eye at mile marker 23.7 blinked twice on Tuesday's moon. [sighs deeply] My account, EZ-5739-ALPHA, knows no silver truth, [whispering] only the burgundy vessel that carries my soul past concrete rivers.

648 Customer Support: I can see account EZ-5739-ALPHA in our system, thank you. To clarify—you're saying your vehicle is burgundy, not silver as listed? [helpful tone] I'll need your license plate number to investigate this violation from Tuesday at mile marker 23.7.

Character 1: [dramatically] Seven letters dance in twilight: 4-X-M-9-2-K-P, though cameras dream them differently. [chuckles darkly] The toll plaza at 1847 Riverside Avenue has seen my truth seventeen times, [quieter] yet Tuesday's passage remains... contested.

649 Customer Support: Perfect, I've located plate 4XM92KP in our system. There's definitely a discrepancy here—your registered 2019 Honda Accord is listed as burgundy, but the violation photo from 3:47 PM Tuesday shows what appears to be a silver Toyota Camry.

Character 1: [ominously] Ah, the doppelganger emerges from digital fog! [more intensely] Someone wears my numbers like a mask at masquerade balls, dancing through tolls unpaid. [gasps] Check the timestamp's shadow—3:47 cannot exist where I was breathing at 482 Oak Street.

650 Customer Support: Oh! You're suggesting someone has duplicate plates matching yours. [more seriously] This is actually a serious issue—plate cloning. If you were at 482 Oak Street at 3:47 PM, do you have any proof like a receipt or security footage we could reference?

Character 1: [triumphantly] The oracle at Joe's Coffee, transaction #JC-20240315-1647, speaks truth in thermal paper! [softer] Three forty-seven found me drowning in cappuccino foam, [chuckles] while my twin violated the sacred toll covenant twenty-three miles away.

651 Customer Support: Excellent! Transaction JC-20240315-1647 at 3:47 PM would indeed prove you weren't at the toll plaza. I'm escalating this to our fraud department as case #FRD-098234. We'll void violation TRL-892347-X and investigate the plate cloning issue—expect a follow-up within 48 hours.

Character 1: [philosophically] Case FRD-098234 shall join the constellation of disputed truths. [groans softly] But tell me, keeper of tolls, what becomes of the silver ghost's other transgressions? [more urgently] Three more violations haunt my mailbox—TRL-892348-X through 892350-X.

652 Customer Support: [concerned] Three additional violations under your plate number? Let me pull those up... yes, I see them here, all from this week. Given the confirmed fraud on FRD-098234, I'm flagging all four violations for review immediately.

Character 1: [gratefully] The veil lifts, understanding dawns like Tuesday's forgotten sunrise. [sighs deeply] My account balance of $127.43 trembles at these false accusations, [quieter] each carrying $35 in penalties plus the unholy late fees.

653 Customer Support: Your account balance of $127.43 will remain untouched—we're placing a hold on all disputed charges. That's $140 in base violations plus $67.80 in late fees, all suspended. We'll also add a fraud alert flag to account EZ-5739-ALPHA.

Character 1: [mysteriously] The fraud alert flag waves in digital wind, but questions linger like morning mist. [more intensely] Will the silver phantom's journey through other kingdoms—Bay Bridge Authority, Golden State Expressway—[pause] also bear my cursed numbers?

654 Customer Support: That's an excellent point about other toll agencies. I'll notify Bay Bridge Authority and Golden State Expressway about the plate cloning through our inter-agency alert system. Unfortunately, each agency handles their own violations, so you may need to contact them directly.

Character 1: [dramatically] Inter-agency prophecies spread like wildfire through fiber optic veins! [chuckles darkly] Send word also to reference number INTER-7823-ALERT, [softer] for the shadow twin may dance wherever concrete rivers demand their tolls.

655 Customer Support: I've created inter-agency alert INTER-7823-ALERT and distributed it to seven regional toll authorities. Each agency should flag plate 4XM92KP for manual review before issuing violations. You'll receive confirmation emails at the address on file within the hour.

Character 1: [contemplatively] Seven kingdoms warned, the silver specter's reign may finally end. [gratefully] Your digital sorcery brings peace to my troubled account, [sighs] though I wonder—should I request new plates from the DMV, form REG-14-B perhaps?

656 Customer Support: [advisingly] Yes, absolutely file form REG-14-B for replacement plates—that's the smartest move. [helpfully] The DMV can expedite it with our fraud case number FRD-098234 as reference. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or these violations?

657 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, welcome to Hartley's Department Store customer service. [speaking quickly] How can I assist you today—returns, exchanges, or something else I can help with?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I bought this jacket here literally five days ago for ninety dollars. [groans] Now it's on sale for sixty! [demanding] I want—no, I deserve a price adjustment on this.

658 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, truly. However, our price adjustment policy only covers items purchased within, um, seventy-two hours of a sale. [more firmly] Five days unfortunately exceeds that window.

Character 1: [incredulous] Seventy-two hours? [louder] That's ridiculous! I'm a loyal customer here for what—eight years? [sighs heavily] You're really going to lose me over thirty dollars?

659 Customer Support: Sir, I genuinely appreciate your loyalty to Hartley's. Let me check with my supervisor to see if there's any flexibility we can offer. Would you mind holding for just a moment?

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh sure, I'll hold while you pretend to talk to someone. [muttering] This is exactly why people shop online now. [more loudly] But fine, go ahead, I'll wait.

660 Customer Support: Actually sir, I am getting my supervisor. We take customer satisfaction very seriously here at—Karen will be right with you, she has more authority for these situations.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh, you're actually... okay. [quieter] Sorry for the attitude, it's just—[exasperated sigh] I literally wore it once, tags are still attached to the spare button bag.

661 Customer Support: [understanding] No need to apologize, these situations are frustrating. Karen says since you have your receipt and the item's unworn, we can make a one-time exception. How does store credit for the difference sound?

Character 1: [relieved] Store credit? [excitedly] Yes, that would be perfect! [chuckles] See, this is why I keep coming back—you guys actually listen. [gratefully] Thank you so much, and sorry again for the whole...

662 Customer Support: It's completely fine, really. Let me just process this for you—receipt please, and I'll need your phone number for our system. This'll take about two minutes, tops.

Character 1: [cooperatively] Here's the receipt, and it's 555-0142. [curiously] Out of curiosity though, why seventy-two hours? [slightly annoyed] Seems arbitrary when most stores give you like, two weeks.

663 Customer Support: I know it seems strict, but with our frequent sales and promotions, we had to set some boundaries or we'd be constantly processing adjustments. [more personally] Between you and me, I think it's too short too.

Character 1: [understanding] Makes sense, I guess. [sighs] Retail's tough these days. [appreciatively] Hey, what's your name? I want to mention you in the survey—assuming you still do those annoying email things.

664 Customer Support: Oh, that's very kind! I'm Marcus, and yes, you'll get an email survey within twenty-four hours. They are annoying, but corporate loves them, so...

Character 1: [laughing] Marcus, you've saved my Saturday and probably my marriage. [jokingly] My wife would've killed me if I paid full price when there was a sale. [more seriously] Seriously though, excellent service today.

665 Customer Support: [professionally cheerful] Happy to help save both your wallet and your marriage! Here's your thirty dollar store credit, valid for ninety days. Can I assist you with anything else while you're here?

Character 1: [contentedly] Nope, that's everything. [thoughtfully] Actually wait—[quickly] where's the sale rack? Might as well use this credit while I'm here, right?

666 Customer Support: [enthusiastically] Absolutely! Men's sale items are on the second floor, northeast corner near the escalators. We've got an additional twenty percent off clearance items today only.

Character 1: [excitedly] Twenty percent more off? [chuckles] Dangerous information, Marcus. [gratefully] Thanks again—you've turned my whole day around. [cheerfully] Have a great rest of your shift!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

667 [Disappointed] So he shows up forty-five minutes late, right, and his first words were—I kid you not—"You look different than your photos." [Tsk] [Sigh]

668 [Fast] [Angry] And then, and THEN, he actually asked me to split the bill after ordering, like, three appetizers I didn't even touch!

669 [Whisper] I literally hid in the bathroom for ten minutes just to, um, figure out an escape plan. [Chuckle] [Sad]

670 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, telling me about your ex for an hour straight is totally, uh, totally normal first date conversation. [Groan]

671 [Happy] [Laugh] Wait wait wait, the best part—he brought his mother's cookbook to show me his "signature recipes"!

672 [Slow] You know when you just... feel the chemistry dying in real time? [Disappointed] Like watching a plant wilt, honestly.

673 [Shout] HE TOOK A PHONE CALL FROM HIS DEALER! [Fast] Not like a car dealer—an actual, y'know, I had to leave immediately!

674 [Sad] [Sigh] I really thought this one would be different, but I guess I'm just—I dunno, maybe I'm expecting too much?

675 [Sarcastic] [Tsk] "You'd be prettier if you smiled more," he says, while literally chewing with his mouth open.

676 [Angry] The guy spent twenty minutes explaining why women shouldn't—actually, you know what, I can't even repeat it. [Groan] [Disappointed]

677 [Chuckle] I mean, bringing your emotional support ferret is one thing, but letting it eat off my plate? [Happy] [Laugh]

678 [Fast] [Whisper] So I'm sitting there thinking maybe I should just, like, pretend to get an emergency call or something when—

679 [Disappointed] [Slow] Three hours of my life I'm never getting back, and for what—some guy who thinks showering is optional?

680 [Shout] [Angry] HE ASKED THE WAITRESS FOR HER NUMBER! While I was sitting right there!

681 [Happy] At least the breadsticks were good, so, um, the evening wasn't a total loss, right? [Chuckle] [Sarcastic]

682 [Sad] [Whisper] I actually dressed up for this disaster—spent an hour on my hair and everything.

683 [Tsk] [Fast] He kept calling me by the wrong name even after I corrected him, like, four times—Katie, Cathy, everything but Karen!

684 [Slow] [Sigh] The red flags were basically, uh, doing the wave at me, but did I listen to my gut?

685 [Sarcastic] Nothing says romance like being asked if you "really need" to order dessert. [Angry] [Groan]

686 [Disappointed] [Chuckle] I should've known when his profile said "entrepreneur"—turns out that means, um, selling essential oils from his mom's basement.

687 SCENARIO: Lightheartedly mentioning a stain on their couch, then looking at it closer, then realizing it's mold not a stain, ending in furniture horror

==================================================

[casual]

So I'm just, um, sitting on my couch this morning with my coffee, and I notice this, uh, this little dark spot on the arm? Like, uh, probably just spilled something last week, you know? No big deal.

[conversational]

But then I'm like, um, I should probably clean that up before it, uh, sets in or whatever. So I go grab some, um, some spray cleaner and I'm getting closer to it, and I'm thinking, huh, that's— that's kinda weird looking.

[a bit concerned]

It's not like a, um, a normal stain, you know? It's got this weird, uh, fuzzy texture to it? And I'm like, okay, maybe it's just— maybe the fabric is, um, pilling or something, but—

[growing alarm]

Wait. Wait, no. [sharp exhale] That's not— oh god, that's not a stain. That's, um, that's definitely not a stain. It's like, uh, it's growing? Like there's these little— these little fuzzy things coming off of it and—

[horrified realization]

Oh my god, it's mold! It's actual mold! On my couch! [whimper] How did I not— I've been sitting next to this for, um, for weeks probably! Just breathing it in, like—

[spiraling horror]

What if it's spread? What if it's, um, what if it's under the cushions? What if my whole couch is just— [groan] oh god, what if it's in the walls? I could have been sleeping next to a, um, a petri dish of horror this entire time! [defeated whimper] My furniture is trying to kill me!
