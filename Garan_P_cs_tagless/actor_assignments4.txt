Character 1: So we're just pretending Tuesday didn't happen?

293 Character 2: What? No! No no no, I wasn't—I mean, I was gonna bring it up, I just didn't know how to—um, I thought maybe you needed space?

Character 1: Space. Right.

294 Character 2: Okay that came out wrong. I wasn't trying to avoid it, I swear. I just—you seemed really mad and I didn't wanna make it worse by bringing it up at the wrong time, y'know? [nervous laugh] But I guess acting normal was... also the wrong move.

Character 1: You texted me about brunch. Like nothing happened.

295 Character 2: I know, I know. That was—god, that was so stupid. I literally typed and deleted like fifteen different apologies before I just... panicked and sent the brunch thing instead.

Character 1: Fifteen apologies you didn't send.

296 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, that's—that's fair. [sigh] I kept overthinking it, like what if I said the wrong thing again? What if I made you more upset? But obviously avoiding it was worse. Way worse.

Character 1: You really hurt me on Tuesday.

297 Character 2: I know. And I'm—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, deeply sorry. What I said was completely out of line and I didn't mean—actually, no, that doesn't matter. Impact over intent, right? I hurt you and that's what matters.

Character 1: Then why act like everything's fine?

298 Character 2: Because I'm—honestly? I'm terrible at confrontation. Like absolutely terrible. And I thought maybe if I just acted normal, we could kinda... ease back into being okay? [groan] Hearing it out loud, that's so dumb.

Character 1: It made me feel like you didn't even care.

299 Character 2: No! Oh my god, no, I care so much. I've been—I've literally been losing my mind about this for three days. Ask my roommate, I've been a complete mess. I just didn't know how to—how to fix it without making everything worse.

Character 1: You could have just apologized.

300 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've—the second it happened, I should've apologized instead of getting defensive and then... whatever this was. Avoiding you? Pretending? I dunno what to even call it.

Character 1: It sucked. This whole week sucked.

301 Character 2: I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. For Tuesday, for the weird texts, for acting like nothing happened—all of it. You didn't deserve any of that. You're like—you're one of my best friends and I completely fucked up.

Character 1: Yeah. You did. But... I miss you.

302 Character 2: I miss you too. So much. Can we—I mean, I know things aren't just magically fixed, but can we talk about it? Like actually talk? I wanna make this right. Whatever it takes.

Script: 410ddd3b_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You've been really negative lately.

303 Character 2: I—what? That's how you're gonna start this conversation? Like, no "hey, how are you" or anything, just straight to attacking me?

Character 1: It's not an attack. It's a fact.

304 Character 2: Okay okay, so maybe I've been a little—I dunno, down or whatever, but you know what I'm dealing with right now. My dad's literally in the hospital and you're mad at me for not being sunshine and rainbows?

Character 1: I know what you're going through. But you're taking it out on everyone.

305 Character 2: That's not—[scoff] I'm not taking anything out on anyone. I'm just trying to get through each day, and yeah, maybe I'm not exactly fun to be around, but I thought you'd understand.

Character 1: Understanding doesn't mean I have to absorb all your negativity.

306 Character 2: Absorb my—wow. Okay. So basically what you're saying is I'm like, toxic or something? That's really what you think of me right now?

Character 1: That's not what I said.

307 Character 2: But it's what you meant, right? Look look, I get that I've been—I haven't been great company lately, fine. But you're acting like I'm doing this on purpose. Like I wake up and choose to be miserable around you.

Character 1: Sometimes it feels that way.

308 Character 2: That's—honestly, that's kind of hurtful. [frustrated laugh] I mean, I'm sorry I can't just compartmentalize my entire life for your comfort, but that's not how this works.

Character 1: I never asked you to compartmentalize. Just maybe try.

309 Character 2: Try? Try what exactly? To pretend everything's fine? You know what, I have been trying. Every single day I try not to completely fall apart, and apparently that's still not good enough for you.

Character 1: You shut down every positive thing anyone says.

310 Character 2: I don't—okay, maybe sometimes I do that, but it's not intentional. It's just hard to see anything positive when literally everything feels like it's falling apart. I'm not trying to bring everyone down with me, I'm just... struggling.

Character 1: We're all trying to help. You won't let us.

311 Character 2: Because—because I don't need you to fix this, okay? [sigh] I just need you to be my friend. And instead you're here basically telling me I'm too much of a downer to be around.

Character 1: That's not fair.

312 Character 2: Yeah well, neither is this whole conversation. You know what, I'm sorry I'm not handling my crisis the right way for you. I'll just—I'll try to be less negative or whatever. Fine.

313 SCENARIO: trying to remember the name of that song stuck in their head

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so there's this song, um, there's this song that's been stuck in my head all morning and I cannot— I cannot for the life of me remember what it's called. It's like, um, it goes something like... [hum] da da da something something...

[slightly more animated]

Oh wait, wait wait wait. Is it that, uh, that one song from the— no, that's not— that's not it at all. [sigh] But it's definitely from like the early 2000s? Maybe? Or was it— no, it might be newer than that, I don't— I don't really know.

[frustrated hum]

The thing is, um, the thing is I know all the words when it comes on, like, I can sing along perfectly, but now when I'm trying to think of it, it's just... [groan] it's just this weird melody floating around in my brain.

[thoughtful]

Wait, okay, let me think. Was it playing at the coffee shop yesterday? Or maybe it was on that, uh, that playlist I was listening to while I was— hmm. Actually, you know what, maybe if I just ignore it, it'll come to me.

[resigned laugh]

Yeah, right. Like that ever works. It's gonna bug me all day until I'm, like, brushing my teeth tonight and then suddenly I'll be like "OH, it was that song!" [chuckle] Classic.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 55896fe1 | Role: Character 1 (A)

314 Character 1: [sniffling] Oh my god, Sarah, look at this one. [voice breaking] The little girl doesn't even recognize him at first, and then— [Sobbing breath] And then she just runs into his arms screaming "Daddy!"

Character 2: [through tears] I can't handle the ones with kids! [shaky voice] They wait so long, missing bedtime stories and soccer games. [Gasping sob] Look how she won't let go of his neck—she's literally clinging to him.

315 Character 1: [high-pitched crying] Why do we do this to ourselves? [more shakily] We could be watching literally anything else right now, but no—here we are, mascara completely destroyed, watching our fifteenth military reunion video today.

Character 2: [wailing] Because they're beautiful! [quieter] These families sacrifice everything. [Hiccupping sob] Did you see the mom in the background? She's been holding it together for months and finally just collapses.

316 Character 1: [trembling whisper] The dog ones get me too. [louder crying] That German Shepherd who hadn't seen his owner for two years? [Choked sob] He knocked him over and wouldn't stop licking his face!

Character 2: [blubbering] Stop mentioning the dog! [in a higher pitch] I'm already dying here! [whimpering] My neighbor probably thinks someone died with all this crying—we sound like we're at a funeral, not watching YouTube.

317 Character 1: [between sobs] Wait, wait, here comes another one. [increasingly hysterical] It's a surprise at a wedding—oh no, the bride doesn't know her brother's home! [Wailing cry] She's walking down the aisle and he's just standing there!

Character 2: [shrieking] Turn it off! [more desperately] I literally cannot breathe! [gulping air] My contact lenses are floating away in a sea of tears and I think I pulled something in my chest from crying so hard.

318 Character 1: [quavering] We said this last time, remember? [sniffling harder] "No more soldier videos," we promised ourselves after that one with the classroom surprise. [Shuddering breath] Yet here we are, emotionally torturing ourselves again on a Tuesday night.

Character 2: [croaking] Pass the tissues—no, just give me the whole box. [voice cracking] These videos should come with a warning label. [Loud sniff] "May cause severe dehydration, puffy eyes, and complete emotional breakdown."

319 Character 1: [whimpering] Look at this comment—someone said their dad never came home. [completely breaking down] Now I'm crying about the video AND the comments! [Sob] Why did I scroll down? Why do I always scroll down?

Character 2: [in a raw voice] That's it, I'm calling my brother. [crying harder] He's just across town but I need to hug him immediately. [Shaky exhale] These videos make you grateful for everyone who comes home.

320 Character 1: [barely coherent] The grandmother one is starting—she's ninety-three! [voice rising] She thinks he's still deployed but he's right behind her! [Ugly crying] She keeps saying "I prayed every night" over and over!

Character 2: [howling] Her little hands shaking as she touches his face! [softer weeping] Making sure he's real, checking if it's really him. [Broken whisper] Seventy years old and still her baby boy.

321 Character 1: [exhausted crying] My face hurts from crying. [snorting laugh-cry] We look absolutely insane—red, blotchy, snot everywhere. [Hiccup] If anyone walked in right now, they'd think we got terrible news or something.

Character 2: [in a wet voice] Remember when we tried watching these at lunch? [mortified tone] The whole restaurant stared while we sobbed into our salads. [Giggling through tears] The waiter kept asking if everything was okay with the food!

322 Character 1: [steadying breath] Okay, last one, I promise. [immediately crying again] No wait, it's twins finding out daddy's home! [Squealing sob] They're in their little matching pajamas running down the hallway!

Character 2: [defeated whimper] I'm done, I'm actually done. [in a drained voice] My tear ducts have given up, I'm just making crying sounds with no tears left. [Weak laugh] We're emotional masochists, you know that right?

323 Character 1: [sighing deeply] Same time next week? [more cheerfully] We can pretend we'll watch comedies instead, lie to ourselves about having self-control. [Soft chuckle] Then end up here again, destroying ourselves with wholesome military content.

Character 2: [laughing while sniffling] Obviously, yes. [in a lighter tone] But I'm bringing waterproof mascara and those cooling eye masks. [Giggle-sob] If we're going to emotionally destroy ourselves, we might as well plan ahead this time!

Script: ab89c626 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I have a confirmation right here—reservation number RX47B92K. [raising voice] I booked this three weeks ago for $45.99 a day, and now you're telling me [incredulous] it doesn't exist?

324 Customer Support: [apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, but when I search RX47B92K in our system, nothing comes up. Could you perhaps check if maybe, um, you booked with a different company? Sometimes customers confuse us with Enterprise or Hertz.

Character 1: [angrily] Different company? Are you serious? [scoffs] I have the email right here from FastTrack Rentals at 4827 Airport Boulevard—that's YOU! [more forcefully] My credit card was already charged $367.92!

325 Customer Support: Well, sir, I'm looking at every reservation for today, March 15th, and there's no booking under your name. Could you spell your last name again? Maybe it's under a different spelling or your corporate account?

Character 1: [exasperated] Thompson—T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N. [slower, condescending] My member ID is FTR-8829304, Gold status since 2019. [groans] How can you lose an entire reservation?

326 Customer Support: Okay, I see you in our system as a Gold member, but... [confused] the last reservation I show was in January, confirmation AZ66M10P. Sir, are you absolutely certain you received a confirmation email from us?

Character 1: [shouting] YES! February 23rd at 2:47 PM, I got the email! [sarcastically] Should I forward it to nowhere@fasttrackdoesntcare.com? [desperately] I have a meeting in two hours at 1500 Commerce Street!

327 Customer Support: Sir, there's no need for that tone. Let me try searching by your credit card—the last four digits? Sometimes the system, well, it doesn't sync properly between online and our counter.

Character 1: [irritated] 4-4-7-8, Visa ending in 4478. [mockingly] Maybe check your magic drawer where all the lost reservations go? [more angrily] This is absolutely unacceptable for a supposedly "premium" rental company!

328 Customer Support: Oh wait—I think I... [hesitant] Sir, did you book for March 15th or May 15th? [nervously] Because I'm seeing RX47B92K here but it's showing for May, not March. That would explain everything.

Script: 8ba5351b | Role: Customer Support

329 Customer Support: Good afternoon, thank you for calling TechNet Support, my name is Sarah. How can I assist you with your internet service today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi Sarah, I've been having serious issues with my internet speed for weeks now. [accusingly] It's like—it starts fine in the morning, but [groans] by evening it's practically crawling.

330 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I understand how frustrating that must be, sir. Let me pull up your account real quick—can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your service?

Character 1: [impatiently] It's 555-0892. [sighs heavily] Look, I pay for the premium package—150 megabits—but I'm barely getting, what, maybe 10? [more angrily] That's not even close to what I'm paying for!

331 Customer Support: Alright Mr. Johnson, I see your account here. [quickly] Now, according to our system, there aren't any reported outages in your area, but I do notice you've exceeded your monthly data allowance.

Character 1: [outraged] Exceeded my—what? [louder] Nobody told me there was a data cap on the unlimited plan! [sarcastically] How exactly is it unlimited if you're throttling me?

332 Customer Support: I understand the confusion, sir. The unlimited plan doesn't cut off your service, but after 1 terabyte of usage, speeds may be reduced during peak network congestion periods.

Character 1: [exasperated] Peak periods—you mean every evening when people actually need to use the internet? [groans] I work from home, Sarah. [desperately] My video calls are freezing, downloads taking hours—this is affecting my job!

333 Customer Support: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Johnson. Let me check if we have any other plans that might better suit your usage needs—actually, we do have a business tier with no throttling whatsoever.

Character 1: [suspiciously] Let me guess, it costs twice as much? [sighs] You know what, I've been a customer for eight years. [firmly] Shouldn't that count for something here?

334 Customer Support: Your loyalty absolutely matters to us, sir. What I can do right now is reset your current cycle—that'll restore your speeds immediately, and I'll add a courtesy credit of thirty dollars.

Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well, that's... that's something at least. [hesitantly] But what happens next month when I hit the cap again? [more firmly] I can't keep calling every month about this.

335 Customer Support: Great question—let me offer you our Speed Boost add-on. It's just fifteen dollars extra monthly, but it doubles your priority data to 2 terabytes, and most customers never hit that threshold.

Character 1: [resigned] So basically, I need to pay more to get what I thought I was already paying for. [chuckles bitterly] This feels like—like buying a car and then finding out the wheels cost extra.

336 Customer Support: I know it seems that way, Mr. Johnson. But between you and me, the Speed Boost really is worth it—especially if you're working from home and streaming.

Character 1: [contemplating] Fifteen extra... [sighs] Fine, you know what? Add it. [more assertively] But if I have any more issues, I'm switching to your competitor—they're offering fiber in my area now.

337 Customer Support: Perfect, I'll add that right away! You'll see the speed improvement within the next five minutes, and [reassuringly] I'm also noting your account for priority support going forward.

Character 1: [skeptically] Priority support—is that actually a thing or just something you say? [tiredly] Because last time I called, I was on hold for forty-five minutes.

338 Customer Support: It's absolutely real, sir—you'll have a direct number that bypasses the main queue. I'm also emailing you my direct extension, just in case you need follow-up on this specific issue.

Character 1: [relieved] Alright Sarah, I appreciate that. [more calmly] Hopefully this actually fixes things because—[chuckles] honestly, I really don't want to deal with setting up new service somewhere else.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

339 [Slow] I dunno, it's like, when I'm by myself, I can actually hear my own thoughts without all the—the noise, you know? [Sigh]

340 [Happy] Oh my god, yes, eating cereal for dinner while watching whatever I want—that's, that's freedom right there! [Laugh]

341 [Whisper] Sometimes I just need to, um, disappear for a while and not explain myself to anybody. [Slow] Is that so wrong?

342 [Sarcastic] Yeah, because apparently wanting five minutes without someone asking me "what's wrong" makes me antisocial. [Tsk] Sure, okay.

343 [Fast] Look, I'm not saying I hate people, I just—I recharge better when it's quiet, alright? [Disappointed] Nobody seems to get that.

344 [Angry] I'm so tired of having to justify this—like, why is it weird that I don't wanna hang out constantly? [Groan]

345 [Sad] The thing is—wait, how do I explain this—I feel more lonely in crowds than I ever do by myself. [Sigh]

346 [Chuckle] Honestly? [Happy] No pants, no problems—that's basically my whole philosophy right there.

347 [Slow] I can literally spend hours just, uh, thinking about stuff without anyone interrupting to ask what I'm thinking about. [Satisfied] [Sigh]

348 [Shout] Because I actually LIKE my own company! [Fast] Why is that so hard for everyone to understand?

349 [Whisper] You know those moments where everything just... stops? [Slow] I only get those when I'm completely alone.

350 [Disappointed] I mean, I tried the whole social thing, but it's—it's exhausting pretending to care about small talk. [Tsk]

351 [Fast] Okay so basically, when I'm alone I can sing badly, dance stupidly, and talk to my plants without judgment—it's great! [Laugh]

352 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me drop everything to attend another "mandatory fun" event. [Angry] That's exactly what I need. [Groan]

353 [Sad] People always assume I'm, like, broken or whatever because I choose this, but I'm not—I'm really not. [Whisper] I'm just different.

354 [Happy] You wanna know the best part? [Chuckle] I never have to compromise on pizza toppings—ever!

355 [Slow] There's this, um, this pressure to constantly perform when you're around others that just—[Sigh]—it melts away when you're alone.

356 [Angry] No, I don't need to "put myself out there more"—I'm perfectly fine in here, thanks! [Tsk] [Fast] God, why does everyone think they're my therapist?

357 [Disappointed] I guess I just thought by now people would stop treating "introvert" like it's some kinda disease that needs fixing. [Slow] But here we are.

358 [Whisper] The silence isn't empty, you know? [Happy] It's actually really full of, like, possibilities and peace and—and me, I guess. [Chuckle]

359 SCENARIO: Offhandedly mentioning a safety thing they skipped, then imagining what could have happened, then spiraling into retrospective near-miss dread

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, so today I was changing the bulb in my bathroom light fixture, and I was like, eh, I don't need to turn off the breaker, you know? It's just one little bulb. [light laugh] I mean, people change lightbulbs all the time without flipping breakers, right?

[conversational]

So I'm up there unscrewing it, and for a split second I'm like, hmm, should I have turned the power off? But then the bulb came out fine, no sparks or anything. Put the new one in, works perfectly.

[a bit thoughtful]

But now I'm thinking about it and... [pause] wait, what if the fixture had been loose or something? Like, what if there were exposed wires I couldn't see?

[growing concerned]

Oh god, I could have been electrocuted. Standing on that wobbly step stool, holding a metal fixture with wet hands because I'd just washed them and— [sharp exhale] I didn't even dry them properly.

[increasingly alarmed]

I could have gotten shocked and fallen backwards onto the tile floor! Cracked my skull open, and you wouldn't have found me until— [nervous laugh] until when? When was the next time you were coming over?

[spiraling] [panicked]

Oh my god, I almost died changing a stupid lightbulb! [whimper] Forty dollars to call an electrician versus dying alone on my bathroom floor because I was too cheap and lazy to flip a breaker switch!
