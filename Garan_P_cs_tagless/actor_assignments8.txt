Character 1: We need to talk about Saturday.

546 Character 2: Oh god, okay—look, I know you're mad about the party thing, but can we just—I mean, I told you weeks ago that wasn't gonna work for me.

Character 1: You say that about everything.

547 Character 2: That's not—that's literally not true. We hung out last week! We went to that movie, we got coffee, we did plenty of stuff.

Character 1: Just the two of us. Always just the two of us.

548 Character 2: Because that's what I'm comfortable with! [Sigh] Like, I don't get why that's suddenly this huge problem when you've known this about me forever.

Character 1: It's not sudden. I'm just tired of missing things.

549 Character 2: Missing—okay okay, so now I'm ruining your life? That's what you're saying? Because I can't just magically be okay with crowds and strangers and all that noise?

Character 1: That's not what I said.

550 Character 2: But it's what you meant, right? I mean, come on. You're basically telling me I'm a bad friend because I have anxiety, which—honestly, that's kinda messed up.

Character 1: You won't even try.

551 Character 2: I do try! I try all the [frustrated laugh] time! You just don't see it because trying for me doesn't look like—like just showing up to some random house party with fifty people I don't know.

Character 1: Twenty people. My birthday party.

552 Character 2: Your—wait, that's what this is about? That's not fair, you said you understood. You literally said "it's fine, don't worry about it" and now you're throwing it in my face?

Character 1: I lied.

553 Character 2: Well that's—I mean, what am I supposed to do with that? I can't go back and un-miss it. And honestly, I would've just had a panic attack anyway, so.

Character 1: You could've taken your meds. You could've left early. Something.

554 Character 2: Oh, so now you're my therapist? Look look, I get that you're hurt, okay? I do. But you're acting like I'm choosing this, like I wake up and decide "hey, let's disappoint everyone today."

Character 1: Aren't you?

555 Character 2: Wow. Okay. Fine fine, if that's really what you think of me, then I dunno why we're even—[scoff] I guess I'm sorry for having a mental illness that inconveniences you.

Script: daa99aa0_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So we're just pretending Monday didn't happen?

556 Character 2: What? No, I—I thought we were good. We talked it out, didn't we? I mean, you said you understood where I was coming from and I said I got your point, so...

Character 1: And then you did the exact same thing at lunch today.

557 Character 2: Okay okay, hold on—that's not the same thing at all. Today was completely different. I wasn't excluding you, I just—Mike asked me a question and I answered it. [scoff] That's literally just having a conversation.

Character 1: Right in front of me. Again.

558 Character 2: You're—come on, you're being kinda unfair here. I can't just not talk to people when you're around. That's not how friendships work, y'know?

Character 1: That's not what this is about.

559 Character 2: Then what—what is it about? Because honestly, I thought we resolved this. I apologized for making you feel left out at the party, and now you're mad that I'm... what, existing normally? [frustrated laugh] I dunno what you want from me.

Character 1: Maybe actually change something instead of just saying you will.

560 Character 2: I am—look look, I am trying, okay? But you're acting like I'm supposed to be perfect immediately. Like, these are habits I've had for years and I'm—I'm working on it, but you gotta give me more than two days.

Character 1: It's been a pattern for months.

561 Character 2: And I didn't—I didn't even know it bothered you until Monday! You never said anything before, so how was I supposed to know? I'm not a mind reader.

Character 1: Shouldn't have to tell you not to make me invisible.

562 Character 2: That's—[sigh] okay, that's dramatic. I never made you invisible. Sometimes I get excited about stuff and I talk over people, yeah, but that's not—it's not personal. I do it to everyone, ask literally anyone.

Character 1: So that makes it okay?

563 Character 2: No! No, that's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to explain that it's not about you specifically, it's just something I gotta work on in general.

Character 1: Sure. Whatever helps you sleep.

564 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So you're just gonna be like this then? Because I'm—I'm really trying here, but you're not giving me anything. You want me to grovel? Is that it?

Character 1: I want you to actually care that you hurt me.

565 Character 2: I do care! But I also—I dunno, I also think you're holding me to this impossible standard where one conversation means I'm suddenly gonna be a completely different person. And that's not—[quieter] that's not really fair either, y'know?

566 SCENARIO: noticing a typo after sending an important email

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so that's— that's sent. Great. Um, hopefully Sarah can get back to me about the, uh, the budget thing by— [pause] wait. Wait wait wait.

[slightly panicked]

Did I just— did I just write "form" instead of "from"? Oh no. Oh no no no. Let me just, um, let me just check my sent folder real quick because I swear I— [groan] yeah. Yeah, I did.

[flat]

"I look forward to hearing form you." Form. F-O-R-M. Like a— like a document. [sigh] This is, um, this is exactly the impression I wanted to make with the new client. Super professional. Really, uh, really on top of things.

[faster, working through it]

Okay but maybe— maybe she won't notice? I mean, people make typos all the time, right? It's not like I wrote something completely insane, it's just one letter. One tiny little— 

[resigned]

But it's right there at the end. Like, the very last thing she's gonna read is "form you" instead of "from you." [exhale] Cool. Just, um, just gonna pretend this never happened and hope for the best, I guess.

Character 1: We need to talk about boundaries.

567 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know what this is about. I'm sorry about yesterday, I really am. I shouldn't have just shown up at your work like that, I wasn't thinking and I—

Character 1: Or last week. Or the week before that.

568 Character 2: Right, yeah, you're—you're totally right. I keep doing this thing where I just... I dunno, I get excited about something and I wanna share it with you immediately and I don't think about whether it's appropriate timing or—[nervous laugh] wow, I'm really bad at this, aren't I?

Character 1: You read my journal.

569 Character 2: That was—okay that was completely out of line. Like, completely. It was just sitting open on your coffee table and I glanced at it without thinking but that's not—that's not an excuse, I know. I shouldn't have even looked.

Character 1: You told Jake about my therapy.

570 Character 2: Wait wait wait, I didn't tell him you were in therapy! I just mentioned that you had an appointment on Thursday so you couldn't come to drinks, and he—he figured it out himself, but yeah, I see how that's still... [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever.

Character 1: Starting to think so.

571 Character 2: No no no, please don't—I mean, I get it. I do. I keep crossing these lines and it's not okay. I just, I've never been good with the whole boundaries thing? Like growing up, my family was all up in each other's business constantly and I know that's not normal but—

Character 1: That's not my problem.

572 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right, it's not. I'm making excuses when I should just be... apologizing. And changing. Um, mostly the changing part, I guess, since apologizing clearly isn't enough anymore.

Character 1: No. It's not.

573 Character 2: I wanna—I wanna fix this. I really do. You're like, one of my best friends and I'm realizing that I've been treating you kinda terribly? Not on purpose but that doesn't matter because the result is the same and you're hurt and I—[sigh] just tell me what you need from me.

Character 1: Space. Actual space. And respect for my privacy.

574 Character 2: Yes. Absolutely. I can—I can do that. I will do that. Um, should I like, text before coming over from now on? Wait, obviously yes, that's a normal thing people do. And I won't touch your stuff or share your personal info or—basically I'll try to act like a normal human being with boundaries.

Character 1: That would be nice. For once.

575 Character 2: I know I've said this before but I really am sorry. Like, genuinely deeply sorry. You've been so patient with me and I just kept... kept pushing and pushing without realizing how much it was affecting you.

Character 1: I care about you. But I can't do this anymore if things don't change.

576 Character 2: They will. They will change, I promise. And not like—not like my usual promises where I forget after a week. I'm gonna actually work on this. Maybe even talk to my therapist about it? Because you're right, this is my problem to fix, not yours to deal with.

577 SCENARIO: noticing a stain on their shirt after leaving the house

==================================================

[muttering]

Oh, what is— what is that? Is that— [sigh] oh great. Great. There's, um, there's something on my shirt. Of course there is. I'm, like, halfway to work and now I have, uh, I have whatever this is just, like, sitting right there on my—

[slightly annoyed]

How did I not see this? I literally, um, I literally looked in the mirror before I left, I thought I looked, you know, I thought I looked fine and now there's this— this brown splotch thing right on the, uh, right on the front where everyone can see it.

[thoughtful]

Is it coffee? It might be coffee. I mean, I was drinking coffee this morning, so that would— that would make sense, right? But I don't remember spilling anything. I don't— wait, maybe when I was putting the lid on? Sometimes it, um, it kind of spatters a little when you—

[resigned]

[tsk] Okay, so what do I— what do I do here? I can't exactly go home and change, I'm already gonna be, like, barely on time. Maybe it's not that noticeable? Maybe people won't— [pause] no, who am I kidding, it's right there.

[practical]

Alright, um, there's probably a bathroom at the coffee shop on Fifth. I could try to, like, dab it with some water or something? It might make it worse, but... I mean, it can't really get much worse than having a mystery stain front and center, so...

578 SCENARIO: waiting for bread to toast

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, bread's in. Toast is, uh— toast is happening. How long does this thing usually take? Like, I feel like I've been standing here for, um, for forever already, but it's probably been what, thirty seconds? [laugh]

[slightly impatient]

I mean, I could go do something else, right? I could, um— I could go check my phone or, or fold that laundry that's been sitting there since— since yesterday. But then what if it, uh, what if it pops up and I'm not here? And it gets all cold and sad?

[conversational]

God, why am I so— why am I so invested in this piece of bread right now? It's not like it's gonna, um, it's not gonna run away if I leave for two minutes. Although, knowing my luck, it'll either burn or, or not toast enough and I'll have to— [sigh] I'll have to start over.

[slightly defeated]

Maybe I'm just hungry. That's probably— that's probably what this is. Low blood sugar makes you, um, makes you weird about toast timing, right? [hmm] That sounds like something that could be true.

[resigned]

Okay, I'm just gonna— I'm just gonna stand here and wait like a normal person. Toast guardian. That's, uh, that's my job now, apparently.

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I've got my— I've got my list, I've got everything, and, um, oh! The coupon. I brought the coupon for the, uh, for the laundry detergent because that stuff is like— it's like twelve dollars now, which is just— [sigh] Let me just find it here.

[slightly brighter] 

Oh, here it is. Okay, so it's, um, it's two dollars off the big bottle, which is— wait. Wait wait wait. [drawn out] What does this say?

[flat realization]

Expires... June fifteenth. Okay, so, um, what's today? Today is the— [pause] today is the twenty-second. Of June. So this is, uh, this is expired. Cool. This is— this is expired by like a whole week.

[frustrated but resigned]

I mean, of course it is, right? Of course the one time I actually remember to bring the stupid coupon, it's— it's not even valid anymore. I probably had this thing sitting in my, um, in my purse for like two months.

[philosophical rambling]

Should I still try it? Like, maybe they won't— maybe they won't notice? But that's, uh, that's probably not— I mean, the cashier's gonna scan it and it'll just beep all angry-like and then I'll have to do that awkward thing where I'm like, "Oh, sorry, never mind."

[resigned chuckle]

You know what? Twelve-dollar detergent it is. I'll just, um, I'll just pay full price like a responsible adult who doesn't— who doesn't let coupons expire in her purse. [laugh] Next time I'll actually check the date. Maybe.

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I need to, um— I need to respond to this email from Sarah, but like, do I start with "Hi Sarah" or do I just, uh, just jump right into it? I mean, she didn't— she didn't use a greeting when she emailed me, so maybe—

[uncertain]

But that feels weird, right? Like, I don't know, it feels kind of, um, kind of rude to just be like "Here's the report" without any, uh, without any sort of... acknowledgment? [hmm] Although, I mean, we literally just talked about this yesterday, so it's not like—

[slightly faster]

Wait, but what if she thinks I'm being too, um, too formal? Like, "Hi Sarah" might be— might be overkill for something this quick. It's just, uh, it's just an attachment, really. Super straightforward.

[indecisive]

Ugh, why am I— why am I overthinking this? [sigh] It's literally two words. "Hi Sarah." Takes half a second to type.

[resigned]

You know what? I'm just— I'm just gonna do the greeting. Better to be, um, better to be too polite than... whatever the opposite of that is. [laugh] There. Done.

[cringing slightly]

Because she had that look, you know? That, um, that polite smile thing where people are like "oh, uh-huh, yeah" but they're not really— they're not really listening because they've heard it before. And I was just, like, going on and on about the fire department and—

[faster, more worried]

Wait, when did I tell her the first time? Was it last week at, um, at the coffee thing? Or was it— no, maybe it was when we ran into each other at, uh, at Target? [sigh] I can't even remember now.

[deflated]

God, I'm that person. I'm the person who tells the same stories twice. My mom does that and I always, like, I always think "Mom, you literally just told me this" but now I'm—

[resigned]

Okay, so, um, next time I see Sarah I'm just gonna, like, pretend it never happened. Right? That's— that's a normal thing to do. [nervous laugh] Everything's fine.

[confused]

Huh. That's, um— that's weird. Nothing's happening. Like, literally nothing. I mean, they're connected, they're— wait, are they connected?

[muttering]

Let me just— okay, Bluetooth says connected, so that's not— that's not the issue. Maybe it's the, uh, the volume? No, volume's fine. This is— [sigh] this is so annoying.

[realization dawning]

Oh. Oh wait. When did I last— when did I last charge these? Because I feel like it was, um, it was like a week ago? Maybe more? [groan] Yeah, okay, they're definitely dead.

[resigned but slightly amused]

Cool. So I guess I'm just— I guess I'm gonna be listening to my own thoughts today instead of, uh, instead of literally anything else. Which is, you know, thrilling. [dry laugh] Really what I was hoping for.

[slightly nervous] 

Oh great, and there's— there's someone just standing there. Just, um, just watching. Cool. That's not, uh, that's not making this weird at all. [exhale] Okay, so I pull up next to this car and then I— wait, how far? Like a foot? Two feet?

[uncertain]

I think it's, um— I think you're supposed to line up the mirrors? Or was it the, uh, the door handles? God, I should know this. I literally have a license, I should— [sigh] okay, backing up now.

Too much. That's, um, that's way too much. Now I'm like practically in the street and this person is probably thinking I'm, uh, I'm some kind of— [groan] let me just pull forward again.

[slightly annoyed]

I mean, I checked the weather this morning, I did, but it said like, um, like light drizzle or whatever, and this is— this is not light drizzle. This is, uh, this is proper rain. Should've brought the, um, the good umbrella instead of this tiny— [tsk] this thing's useless.

[resigned]

Okay, so maybe I should just, um, maybe I should duck into that coffee shop? But then I'll miss the bus, and the next one's not for, what, fifteen minutes? Twenty? [exhale] And I'm already gonna be, uh, I'm already gonna be cutting it close for the meeting.

[brightening slightly]

Oh wait, wait, is that— no, that's not it, that's the, um, that's the 42. Wrong direction. [groan] Of course.

[slightly panicked]

Oh no. Oh no no no, that's— that's not gonna work. The dentist is gonna be, like, at least an hour, right? I mean, it's just a cleaning, but they always— they always run late, and then there's the, um, the fluoride thing, and—

[thinking out loud]

Okay, so if I— if I text Sarah now, maybe we can, uh, maybe we can push it to four? Four thirty? But didn't she say she had that, um, that thing with her mom later? [groan] Why do I do this to myself?

[resigned]

I should probably just— I should just call the dentist and see if they can, uh, if they can move me earlier. Or later. I don't know. [sigh] This is what I get for, um, for scheduling things on my phone at like midnight when I can't think straight.

Okay, so, um, I've got like fifteen minutes before I need to be there, and I'm just— I'm standing here like an idiot trying to decide if I should, uh, if I should take the usual way or try that, um, that new route I saw on the map thing.

[slightly uncertain]

I mean, the regular way takes what, like twelve minutes? Maybe thirteen if there's, uh, if there's that backup at the light. But this new way could be— I don't know, it could be faster? Or it could be, um, it could be a total disaster and I'll end up lost and late and—

[muttering]

Right, okay, but how hard can it be? It's just, like, straight down Miller instead of taking the, uh, the usual left on Oak. That's not— that's not rocket science. I mean, I've lived here for how long now?

[conflicted]

But what if there's construction? What if it's one of those streets that looks fine on the map but is actually, like, a nightmare in real life with no parking and— [sigh] God, why am I overthinking this?

[slightly restless]

Should I go ask? Like, is that— is that a thing people do? Just walk up and be like, "hey, um, did you forget about me?" [nervous laugh] That seems, uh, that seems kind of pushy though.

[matter-of-fact]

Maybe they're running behind. Doctors always run behind, that's like, that's like their thing, right? The person before me probably had something complicated, or— or maybe they had a lot of questions.

So I'm literally losing my mind over this stupid project Derek assigned me. He's like "analyze the customer feedback patterns" and I'm like— okay, which customers? What patterns? What am I even looking for?

[annoyed]

Like I sat there for two hours just staring at spreadsheets going nowhere. I felt so dumb, you know? Everyone else seems to just, like, magically understand what he wants when he gives these vague-ass instructions.

[irritated]

And I didn't want to be that person who's like constantly asking for clarification, but I was about to just— I was gonna have to email him and be like "um, can you actually explain what you mean" which is so embarrassing.

[surprised]

Oh wait, he's— he just messaged me actually. Let me... [pause] Oh. OH.

[relieved] [slightly embarrassed]

Okay so he sent me this example from last quarter where Sarah did something similar, and it's like— it's actually super clear now what he wants. Like, he wants me to look at complaint themes by product category and track how they change month to month.

[lighter] [chuckling]

God, why didn't he just say that in the first place? [half laugh] I was literally about to have a breakdown over nothing. This is actually gonna be pretty straightforward now that I, you know, actually understand what I'm doing.

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my God, so I finally did it! I packed that perfect picnic basket with all the fancy cheese and the good crackers and those little sandwiches with the crusts cut off like— like I'm in some romantic movie or whatever. [laugh] I was so ready for this perfect afternoon in the park, you know?

[enthusiastic]

And the weather was absolutely gorgeous, like not a cloud in the sky, perfect temperature. I'm walking to the park thinking this is gonna be amazing, I'm gonna read my book, eat good food, just have this whole peaceful vibe going.

[frustrated] [slight disgust]

But oh my God, the second— the literal second I spread out my blanket, it's like every bug in the entire city just descended on me. Like wasps buzzing around the food, ants crawling all over everything, and these weird little flies that kept— [groan] they kept flying right into my face.

[defeated]

I tried to stick it out for like twenty minutes but I was basically just swatting at the air the whole time, couldn't even take a bite without something landing on my sandwich. I was ready to just pack up and go home, honestly.

[surprised] [hopeful]

But wait— oh, actually as I'm walking back to my car, I notice this little spot under these big oak trees. It's got this perfect shade and there's like... there's this breeze coming through?

[delighted] [relieved]

And somehow there were zero bugs! Like the wind was just keeping them all away, and it was actually better than my original spot. So I ended up having the most amazing afternoon after all— sometimes you just gotta, you know, roll with it.

590 SCENARIO: Upset about a rejected application, then gets a call asking them to reapply for a better position

==================================================

[dejected]

So I got the rejection email this morning and I'm just— [sigh] I'm honestly pretty crushed about it. Like I knew it was competitive but I really thought I had a shot, you know? 

[frustrated]

I spent like two weeks on that application, stayed up until like midnight tweaking my cover letter, and they just— they just sent me this generic "thanks but no thanks" thing. Didn't even give me any feedback or anything.

[bitter]

And the worst part is I turned down that interview with the consulting firm for this. I was like, no, I really want this position, this is my dream job, blah blah blah. [scoff] So stupid.

[annoyed]

Now I'm back to square one and I have to start applying to all these random— Oh wait, sorry, my phone's ringing. Let me just— it's actually the same company, that's weird.

[confused] [surprised]

Um... okay so that was HR and apparently they want me to reapply? For a senior position that just opened up? Like, a better position than the one I originally applied for.

[excited] [slightly bewildered]

She said my application was really strong but they thought I was overqualified for the first role, so they held onto it and— [nervous laugh] I might actually get something even better? 

[relieved] [happy]

God, I feel like such an idiot for being so dramatic earlier. This is— this is actually amazing.

==================================================

[frustrated]

Ugh, so I've been trying to download this stupid game update since like 9 AM, and it's just— it's been sitting there at like 30% forever. Like literally forever.

[annoyed]

I kept checking every few minutes like maybe it would magically speed up, but no. Nothing. Just this little progress bar mocking me, you know?

[increasingly agitated]

And of course today's the day I actually have time to play, right? Like I cleared my whole afternoon, I got snacks, I was so ready to just— to just veg out and enjoy myself for once.

[groan] [exasperated]

Instead I'm just staring at this thing like willing it to move faster. Seventeen gigs! Who makes a seventeen gig update? That's insane, that's like— that's bigger than some entire games I have.

[ranting]

And my internet's not even that bad usually, it's just today of all days it decides to be— oh wait, wait. Hold on, it's— 

[surprised] [excited]

Oh my god, it just finished! Like right now, it just— [laugh] okay never mind, I'm good. Crisis averted.

[sheepish] [amused]

God, listen to me complaining for five minutes straight about something that literally just fixed itself. [chuckle] Okay, I'm gonna go play now before something else breaks.

592 SCENARIO: Excited about cooking a big meal, then burns part of it, then tastes it and it's still delicious

==================================================

[excited]

Oh my god, okay, so I decided to make that whole spread today, you know? Like the— the herb-crusted chicken, roasted vegetables, that fancy potato thing we saw on Instagram. I went to three different stores to get everything, I'm talking fresh thyme, baby carrots, those little fingerling potatoes that cost like eight dollars.

[enthusiastic]

I had it all planned out, like military precision. Chicken in first, then potatoes, then— oh, and I made that garlic butter sauce from scratch. From scratch! I felt like such a, like a real chef or whatever.

[disappointed] [frustrated]

But then I got distracted by this work call and I— [groan] I totally forgot about the potatoes. Like completely forgot. Twenty minutes later I'm smelling something burning and I'm like oh no, oh no no no.

[deflated]

I thought I ruined everything. The potatoes were like, black on the bottom, and I'm thinking this whole day is just— this whole beautiful meal is just destroyed.

[surprised] [lighter]

But wait, so I'm tasting it right now, and— oh my god, it's actually incredible? Like the burnt bits are kind of... smoky? And everything else turned out perfect and I'm like, maybe I'm actually better at this than I thought.

[pleased] [chuckling]

Sometimes disasters just... work out, I guess.

593 SCENARIO: Casually mentioning a small lie they told at work, then thinking about documentation, then realizing there's a paper trail that contradicts them, ending in professional lie anxiety

==================================================

[casual]

So I had this weird thing happen at work today. My manager asked if I'd finished reviewing those client contracts, and I was like, yeah, totally done. Which, you know, I wasn't completely done, but I was like ninety percent there.

[conversational]

It's not a big deal, right? I mean, everyone does that. You say you're done when you're mostly done. [light laugh] I figured I'd just wrap up the last few pages tonight and no one would know the difference.

[a bit uncertain]

But then I started thinking about it, because you know how they have us log everything in that system now? Like, every time we open a document, when we save it, all that digital footprint stuff?

[more worried]

And I'm realizing— wait. [nervous laugh] If they really wanted to check, they could just look at the timestamps, right? Like when I last accessed those files?

[growing anxiety]

Oh god. Oh no. The last entry was yesterday morning. Yesterday! [sharp exhale] If my manager pulls that report, it's gonna show I haven't even touched those contracts since before she asked me about them.

[spiraling]

What am I gonna do? I can't just— I can't go back and say "Actually, funny story..." [groan] She's gonna think I'm completely incompetent. Or worse, dishonest! Which I guess I am now? [frantic] Ugh, why did I say that?

==================================================

[casual]

So I had this, um, this meeting today with the new client, and it went, uh, it went pretty well actually. Like, they seemed really impressed with the, um, the proposal we put together, you know?

[pleased]

And then at the end, the CEO was like, "We've never seen someone so young handle a presentation like that." Which, I mean, uh, I guess that's— that's nice to hear, right? Like, um, age doesn't really matter if you know your stuff.

[getting a bit boastful]

I mean, I did nail every single question they threw at me. Like, uh, they tried to stump me with some pretty technical stuff and I just— I just had all the answers ready, you know? The whole room was just, um, just nodding along.

[realizing how it sounds]

Wait, that— that sounded really braggy, didn't it? [nervous laugh] I wasn't trying to— I mean, um, I was just telling you what happened, but— God, I sound like such a— such a show-off.

[spiraling into shame]

Oh no, I'm— I'm totally that person now. The, um, the humble-brag person who's like "Oh, they said I was so young and talented" — [groan] — ugh, I hate when people do that! And now I'm— I'm literally doing it!

[mortified]

I can't— I can't even tell a story without making it about how, uh, how amazing I apparently think I am. [defeated sigh] This is— this is so embarrassing. I'm the worst.

Oh my god, you know what's been driving me crazy all week? I keep getting this notification on my phone and I just— [light laugh] I keep swiping it away without reading it. It's like a reflex at this point, you know?

[conversational]

It pops up every day and I'm like, "Not now, mystery notification!" [chuckle] I think it's probably just some app update or something stupid. Who has time to read every little ping, right?

[slightly amused]

Actually, it's sitting there right now. Look at me being all rebellious, just letting it sit there unread. [scoff] Take that, notification overlords!

[curious]

You know what, fine, let me just— let me see what this thing even is. It's probably gonna be like "Rate our app!" or something equally annoying and I can finally delete it and—

[stopping short]

Oh. Oh wait. [exhale] This is... this is from the scholarship committee.

[growing concern]

"Final reminder: application materials due"— when was this sent? [nervous laugh] When was— oh no. Oh no no no.

[panicked] [voice rising]

The deadline was yesterday! YESTERDAY! [groan] I've been dismissing a scholarship reminder for a week! Fifteen thousand dollars! I just— [frustrated laugh] I just swiped away fifteen thousand dollars because I couldn't be bothered to read two sentences!

[spiraling] [nearly shouting]

Who does that?! Who ignores notifications about free money?! [defeated wail] I'm gonna be paying student loans until I'm sixty because I have notification ADHD!

==================================================

[casual]

So you know that call I got earlier? The one I totally ignored because I was in the middle of that Netflix thing? [light laugh] I was like, eh, if it's important they'll leave a voicemail, right?

[conversational]

Which, you know, is like my life motto at this point. I'm basically unreachable unless you text me first. [chuckle] I've become one of those people who treats their phone like a suggestion.

[slightly curious]

But okay, so now I'm curious who it was, because they didn't leave a voicemail, which is— wait, let me just... [pause] Oh. Oh, it was the vet's office.

[concern creeping in]

That's weird, why would they— [sharp intake] Oh no. Oh no no no. Today's the fifteenth.

[panic building]

The appointment! Luna's vaccination appointment was today! They were calling to confirm and I— [groan] it was at three-thirty and it's already— [checking] it's five-fifteen!

[spiraling] [frustrated]

Are you kidding me right now? I've been trying to get her in for weeks! Weeks! And they finally had an opening and I just— [huff] because I couldn't pause my stupid show for thirty seconds!

[exasperated] [angry at self]

God, I'm such an idiot! Now she's gonna be overdue and I'll have to wait another month and— [defeated groan] I'm the worst pet parent ever. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom said would happen when I got a dog!

So I had to do this background check thing today for the new job. You know how it is, just the standard stuff – they send you the link, you fill out all your addresses for the past seven years, employment history, all that fun paperwork.

[conversational] [light laugh]

I mean, what are they gonna find, right? My biggest crime is probably those library fines from college. [chuckle] Oh, and that time I got pulled over for speeding but just got a warning.

[thoughtful]

Actually, now that I think about it... seven years is a long time. There's probably stuff I'm not even remembering. Like, what if there's some random thing that—

[pause] [realization dawning]

Wait. Wait, hold on. [exhales] Seven years ago... that would include 2017, wouldn't it?

[growing concern]

Oh god. The thing with Marcus. When we— when we got arrested at that protest. [nervous laugh] I mean, it wasn't even a real arrest, right? They just detained us for like two hours and let everyone go.

[increasingly anxious]

But they— they took our names. They definitely took our names. And fingerprints? Did they take fingerprints? [panicking] I can't remember if they took fingerprints!

[spiraling] [frantic]

What if that shows up? What if they think I'm some kind of— [groan] Oh my god, what if I don't get the job because of this? I should have told them, shouldn't I have told them?

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my god, you're not gonna believe what happened at the repair shop today. So they quoted me two hundred for the brake pads last week, right? I go to pick up my car and suddenly it's three-fifty because they're like "oh well we found additional wear on the rotors."

[annoyed]

And I'm like, that's not— that's not what we agreed on? Like I specifically asked if there could be any other issues and the guy was like "nah, just the pads, easy job." So now I'm standing there like, what, do I just not have a car? Because I literally only brought two-twenty in cash.

[angry]

I was so pissed, I was like— I started getting loud about it, you know? Like this is exactly the kind of thing that gives mechanics a bad reputation, and I told them that. I was like "this is ridiculous, you can't just change the price after the work is done."

[surprised] [confused]

But then— okay this is weird— the manager comes over while I'm mid-rant and he's like "you know what, we're gonna honor the original quote." Just like that. Two hundred, exactly what they said.

[sheepish]

And now I feel kind of bad because I was, um... I was pretty rude to the front desk guy. [nervous laugh] Like, they actually did the right thing in the end, and I was just— yeah. I should probably bring them donuts or something.

[giddy]

We're doing this whole thing, dinner at that new place downtown and then maybe drinks after if it goes well, which— [nervous laugh] God I hope it goes well. I keep like rehearsing conversations in my head which is probably insane but—

[confused]

Oh wait, I'm getting a text from them right now. Hold on, let me just— um... 

[deflated]

Oh. They're canceling tonight. Great. [sigh] That's just— yeah that's perfect, that's exactly what I needed right now.

[reading more carefully] [quieter]

Wait, but they're saying— hold on, let me read the whole thing... they want to reschedule because they realized they, um, they want to plan something bigger? 

[surprised] [warming up]

Like they've been thinking about it all week and they want our first date to be really special, not just like a regular dinner, so they booked something for this weekend instead and they're being all mysterious about it.

Oh my god, so I had that interview today at Morrison & Associates? The marketing firm I was telling you about? And it went so well, like— I think it actually went really well.

[enthusiastic]

The creative director was asking me all these questions about campaign strategy and I just felt like, you know, like I was totally in my element. Like everything I said just clicked with what they were looking for.

[starting to deflate]

But then afterward I started thinking, like... I don't know, maybe I oversold myself? Like they wanted someone with five years of experience and I have eight, so maybe they're gonna think I'm gonna want too much money or that I'll get bored or—

[worried]

God, what if they think I'm gonna leave as soon as something better comes along? I should have played it down more, been less— less enthusiastic about my previous campaigns and stuff.

[surprised]

Oh wait, hold on— they're calling me right now. Should I— okay I'm gonna answer this, hold on.

[deflated] [confused]

That was... okay that was weird. They said I interviewed really well but they've decided to go with someone else because I'm— [sigh] because I'm overqualified and they're worried I won't be satisfied with the role.

[bitter] [half laugh]

So apparently being good at your job is now a bad thing? Great. Just great.
