What? Wait, what hole? I didn't—okay, hold on, where? I literally just gave it back to you like an hour ago and it was fine.
I'm looking at—oh. Oh shit. But that's—that's barely even noticeable! I swear I didn't know that was there. When did that even happen?
Don't do that. Don't be like that. I'm not lying to you, I genuinely [scoff] didn't see it. If I had, I would've told you, obviously.
Yes! God, yes, I would've. What, you think I'm just gonna—gonna damage your stuff and pretend nothing happened? That's not who I am and you know it.
Okay okay, I get that it's expensive, but you're acting like I took scissors to it or something. It's a tiny tear that I didn't even notice [frustrated laugh] which means it probably happened doing normal stuff.
Yeah, normal—look, you said I could borrow it for the weekend. You didn't say "don't wear it anywhere" or "be super careful" or whatever. I wore it like a normal jacket.
That's—wow, okay. That's really unfair. I was careful with it! I didn't, like, go mountain climbing in it or anything. Sometimes shit just happens, y'know?
Not just your—[groan] come on, don't make it sound like I'm always breaking your stuff. This is literally the first time anything's ever happened, and I'm sorry, okay? I am. But I also didn't do it on purpose.
I mean—yeah, fine, maybe I should've inspected every inch of it, but honestly? I didn't think I needed to. It's not like I knew anything happened to it.
Look look, I'll—I'll pay to fix it or whatever, alright? But can you maybe stop acting like I'm some horrible person who doesn't care about your things? Because that's kinda what this feels like right now.
I—okay, I know how this looks. I was gonna tell you, I swear, but everything happened so fast and I just—I didn't know how to bring it up, y'know?
I know, I know! God, I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. The job offer came like two weeks ago and I kept trying to find the right time to tell you but then—[nervous laugh] there's never really a right time for this kinda thing, is there?
Yeah. Two whole weeks of me being a complete coward. I just—every time I saw you I'd think "okay, tell them now" but then you'd be having a good day or a bad day and I'd just... chicken out.
Oh god, the apartment photos—I didn't even think—I'm so sorry. That's literally the worst way to find out and I just, I posted without thinking because my mom kept asking for pictures and I—[groan] I'm such an idiot.
I deserve that. I do. I just—I didn't wanna say goodbye, y'know? Like we've been friends for what, eight years? And I kept thinking if I didn't tell you then maybe it wouldn't be real yet.
I know, I know, it's stupid. But you're—you're basically my best friend and the thought of telling you I'm leaving was just... terrifying. Which is no excuse, I get that.
Um, next Friday actually. Which is—yeah, I know, that's basically no time at all and I should've told you weeks ago. Months ago, honestly, when I first started applying for jobs out there.
Wait wait wait—please don't shut me out. I know I messed up, like really badly, but we still have a week and I wanna—I need to spend it with you. [quieter] If you'll let me.
That's—that's fair. I get it. But can we at least—I dunno, get coffee tomorrow? Or whenever you're ready? I just really don't wanna leave things like this between us.
Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—I'm really, really sorry. You deserved so much better than finding out like that. I was scared of losing you and I ended up—[sigh] I ended up hurting you anyway.
Wait wait wait—what? The one you applied for like, months ago? Oh my god, that's—that's huge! When did you find out?
Thursday? Like, this Thursday? That's—okay that's really soon. Are you freaking out? I'd be totally freaking out right now, honestly.
No no no, but you're gonna be amazing! You're like—you're literally the most articulate person I know. Even when you're being all... [Laugh] you know, quiet and mysterious.
It's not—wait, is it live? I thought these things were usually pre-recorded or whatever. Either way, you won't freeze. You're way too prepared for that.
Okay so maybe don't think about the thousands of—actually, you know what? Just pretend you're talking to me. Like we're having coffee or something, right?
[Gasp] I do not—okay fine, maybe I do. But that's because I get excited! Look, the point is, you've got interesting things to say. That's why they picked you.
Oh come on, that's—no. They don't just randomly select people for TV. They saw something in your application that made them go "yes, this person, we need them." That's kinda incredible, actually.
See? See, you're already—wait, navy blue? That's perfect for TV! Very professional, very... trustworthy or whatever. [Chuckle] God, you're gonna look so good.
Then you do that thing where you pause and—you know how you get all thoughtful? That actually comes across as like, really wise. Just be yourself, basically. The quiet confidence thing totally works.
Absolutely not—no way. This is too good to pass up. Plus I already told my mom, so... you're kinda committed now. She's gonna watch and everything.
I—okay, yeah, I did, but I tried calling you like five times. Your phone was off or dead or something, and we were gonna lose the whole opportunity if I didn't just—y'know, make the call.
Could've waited? Seriously? They gave us until noon to decide, and it was already eleven-thirty. I'm not gonna [scoff] throw away something we've been working on for months just because you didn't charge your phone.
Then what—what is the point? Because from where I'm standing, I made the best decision I could with the time we had. And honestly? I think you would've done the exact same thing.
And we were! We are! I mean—look look, I get that you're pissed, okay? But I literally had no other option. What was I supposed to do, let everything fall apart because I couldn't reach you for two hours?
That's all they gave us! God, you're acting like I—like I planned this or something. [frustrated laugh] I was freaking out trying to get hold of you. Ask Jamie, ask anyone who was there.
Of course I—yes, okay? Yes. They said noon, final offer, take it or leave it. And I'm sorry, but I wasn't gonna leave it. Not after everything we put into this.
That's not—I never said it was just me. Come on, don't twist my words. You know that's not what I meant. But somebody had to make the decision, and you weren't there.
What? I didn't—[pause] you didn't tell me that. How was I supposed to know that? All I knew was that you weren't answering, and I had like twenty minutes to decide our entire future.
Okay okay, fine. You wanna be mad, be mad. But I'm not gonna apologize for doing what I thought was right. Maybe—maybe I should've waited, I dunno, but in the moment? I did what made sense.
Yeah. [quieter] I guess we do. Look, I'm—I'm sorry about your mom, I really am. But you can't blame me for not knowing something you didn't tell me.
Oh god, okay—wait, let me explain. It wasn't—I didn't mean for it to come out like that. He was grilling me about the budget thing and I just—I kinda froze up, you know?
No no no, that's not—[groan] okay yeah, it sounds bad when you say it like that. But I wasn't trying to blame you, I swear. I was trying to explain that we both worked on it and then he just... assumed things.
I know you're mad. You have every right to be mad. I should've—I should've corrected him immediately but I was so scared of getting fired and I just... I panicked. Like completely panicked.
That's—god, when you put it like that. I'm literally the worst friend ever, aren't I? [nervous laugh] I mean, I already went back to Marcus this morning to tell him the truth. Before you even got in.
Yeah, I—I couldn't sleep at all last night. Kept thinking about how I totally threw you under the bus and I just... I had to fix it. I told him everything. That it was actually my idea, that you tried to warn me about the risks, all of it.
He was, um... he wasn't happy. Obviously. But honestly? I don't even care if he fires me at this point. I just—I couldn't let you take the heat for my stupid mistake, y'know?
Maybe? Probably? I dunno, he said he needs to—to "reassess my judgment" or whatever. [sigh] But that's not your problem. I'm just... I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, deeply sorry.
First thing. Like literally sat outside his office for forty-five minutes waiting for him to get in. I know it doesn't—it doesn't erase what I did yesterday, but I had to at least try to make it right.
Yeah, well, I mean—I wasn't gonna tell you initially 'cause I didn't wanna seem like I was trying to get credit for fixing my own mess? But then I realized that's stupid and you deserve to know that I'm trying—I'm really trying to fix this.
It's literally the least I could do. And I mean that. I'm gonna—I'm gonna work on the whole freezing under pressure thing, I promise. You deserve a friend who has your back, not one who... does what I did.
[exhausted] I've already explained three times that visiting hours ended at eight. [slower, firm] Your mother is stable and sleeping peacefully right now. [Deep sigh] Please, you need to let her rest—she's been through two procedures today.
[defensive, strained] I have seven other patients tonight, two on ventilators. [quieter] Your mother received medication forty minutes ago—it's documented. [more firmly] If you'd actually listened instead of yelling, you'd know she rated her pain at two out of ten.
[flat, resigned] The charge nurse is handling a code blue right now. [Bitter laugh] But sure, I'll add your complaint to my list. [mumbling] Right after I check on the patient who's actually dying down the hall.
[voice cracking] Twenty-two years I've been doing this job. [quieter, hollow] Twenty-two years of families thinking they know better than medical professionals. [Shaky breath] Your mother is getting excellent care, whether you choose to see it or not.
[cold, measured] I held three people's hands as they died this week. [voice breaking slightly] Yesterday, a nineteen-year-old. [steadier, louder] So forgive me if I'm not devastated that your mother's ice chips aren't cold enough for your liking.
[gentler, tired] I understand you're frightened. [more patiently] But attacking the staff won't help your mother heal faster. [Soft sigh] She's genuinely doing well—her vitals are stable, and she should be home by Thursday if she continues improving.
[considering, weary] Five minutes. [more sternly] But if she wakes up agitated, you leave immediately. [warning tone] She needs uninterrupted sleep for her body to heal properly. The rules exist for medical reasons, not to punish families.
[professional but warmer] We all cope differently with stress. [matter-of-fact] Your mother mentioned you're a bit of a warrior when it comes to protecting family. [Slight chuckle] She actually warned us you might be... intense.
[encouraging] That would help everyone, including her. [instructive tone] Tomorrow's day shift starts at seven—Dr. Martinez does rounds at eight-thirty. [helpfully] If you're here then, you can ask all your questions directly and get detailed answers.
[surprised, softer] That's... actually very thoughtful. [lighter tone] The day shift would definitely appreciate it—they're coffee addicts. [Tired laugh] Just skip the decaf; we can spot that betrayal from a mile away around here.
[professionally] Well, the contribution limits depend on several factors. [clearly] For 2024, the basic 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000, not $6,500. [helpfully] However, if you're talking about an IRA, [more slowly] that would be $7,000 for most people.
[patiently] That's alright, we can look that up differently. [reassuring tone] Just to clarify though, are you asking about your employer's 401(k) plan, [slightly slower] or do you have an Individual Retirement Account with us?
[understanding] Ah, so you're referring to your workplace 401(k) plan. [informatively] The $23,000 limit I mentioned is correct for that. [encouragingly] Plus, if you're 50 or older, [emphasizing] you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution.
[confirmingly] Exactly right—$30,500 total for 2024! [cheerfully] That's the maximum you can contribute from your salary. [clarifying] Your employer's matching contributions don't count toward that limit, [more enthusiastically] so that 6% match is extra money on top.
[helpfully] Contributing $400 monthly would give you $4,800 annually, which is a great start! [explaining] Most employers deduct per paycheck though. [practically] If you're paid bi-weekly, [calculating] that would be about $185 per paycheck to reach your $400 monthly goal.
[clarifying gently] Bi-weekly means every two weeks, so 26 paychecks per year. [more precisely] Semi-monthly would be twice a month, or 24 paychecks. [reassuringly] I can check your pay frequency, [pause] but you'd need to verify that employee ID with your HR department first.
[approvingly] Perfect math—exactly $200 per paycheck! [encouragingly] That's a solid contribution amount that won't overwhelm your budget. [informatively] Remember, this reduces your taxable income too, [more enthusiastically] so your actual take-home pay won't decrease by the full $200.
[explaining clearly] Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, meaning they lower your taxable income. [illustrating] If you're in the 22% tax bracket, a $200 contribution might only reduce your take-home by about $156. [reassuringly] So yes, [confidently] the impact is less than the actual contribution amount.
[sympathetically] Yes, $1,270.83 per paycheck to be exact—that's quite substantial! [encouragingly] Most people work up to higher contributions gradually over time. [practically] As you get raises or pay off debts, [suggesting gently] you can increase your percentage slowly.
[laughing warmly] The form names can be confusing! [helpfully] You'll typically need to log into your employer's benefits portal or contact HR directly. [reassuringly] They'll have the correct change form, [concluding] and most companies now let you adjust contributions online—no paper forms needed!
[professionally] Good afternoon, this is Mike from Precision Home Inspections returning your call. [clearing throat] I understand you have some concerns about the inspection report we completed yesterday?
[defensively] Sir, I assure you I did access the attic through the pull-down stairs. [more firmly] The moisture readings were off the charts, and there were visible—[pause]—dark stains on several rafters.
[quickly, nervously] Well, sometimes these issues aren't visible in photos, especially if—if taken with flash. [more confidently] Mold can hide behind insulation, and my thermal camera picked up significant temperature variations.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, truly. [speaking faster] Perhaps we should schedule a reinspection—no charge obviously—and I can bring my moisture meter documentation from yesterday's visit.
[calmly] Sir, I've been doing this for fifteen years, and I stand by my findings. [more assertively] However, if there's been an error, we need to—to rectify this immediately. [urgently] Can we meet at the property this afternoon?
[briskly] I'll be there with my full kit and all yesterday's readings documented. [reassuringly] We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise you that.
[slightly offended] Mr. Davidson, I did access that attic, and I have the photos to—[catching himself] [more professionally] Let's review everything together at three, shall we?
[quickly] That's absolutely your right, and honestly, I'd welcome a second opinion. [confidently] Professional oversight never hurt anyone, especially when there's this much confusion.
[earnestly] Sir, I report what I see, nothing more, nothing less. [pause] If I made an error—which I doubt—but if I did, [firmly] I'll own it completely.
[professionally] Understood completely. [speaking quicker] I'll also bring contact information for remediation specialists, just in case my findings are confirmed and you need quick action for the sellers.
[Disappointed] So we're, uh, we're technically still married but like—honestly, we haven't lived together in eight months. [Sigh]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just explain this in a way that makes sense because it totally does. [Tsk] [Fast] We're exclusive except when we're not.
[Happy] Actually, you know what? Being in this weird limbo thing is kinda working for us right now! [Chuckle]
[Whisper] I still have their Netflix password and they haven't changed it, so... [Slow] that's gotta mean something, right?
[Angry] [Shout] No, we're NOT back together—we're just, I dunno, figuring things out while living in the same apartment!
[Sad] My therapist says I should—actually, never mind what she says. [Sigh] [Slow] I'm basically holding onto something that probably isn't there anymore.
[Fast] Okay so basically we broke up but then we didn't but then we did but now we text every day? [Laugh] [Happy] It's insane, I know!
[Disappointed] Their mom still calls me her daughter-in-law which is, um, which is really awkward considering everything. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] [Slow] We're in what I like to call a "quantum relationship"—simultaneously together and apart until someone observes us.
[Whisper] Between you and me, I think we're both just too scared to actually end it for real. [Sad] [Sigh]
[Happy] [Fast] Wait wait wait, did I mention the part where we adopted a dog together last week? [Laugh] After breaking up!
[Angry] I mean, they literally introduced me as their "friend" at that party, so—[Groan] I honestly don't know what we are anymore.
[Slow] Sometimes I wonder if we're just, er, comfortable with being miserable together, y'know? [Disappointed] [Sigh]
[Shout] [Angry] We're taking a break—not like a Ross and Rachel break—an actual, mature, adult break!
[Chuckle] My relationship status on Facebook has been "It's Complicated" for so long that people stopped asking. [Sarcastic] Really living up to the cliché here.
[Fast] [Happy] Honestly though? The whole undefined thing means zero pressure and I'm kinda loving it right now!
[Sad] We still say "I love you" but it's more like, um, like how you'd say it to an old friend. [Slow] Different than before.
[Whisper] [Disappointed] I found out they're on dating apps but... we never actually said we were exclusive, so.
[Sarcastic] Sure, I'll explain it—got three hours and a flowchart? [Tsk] [Fast] Because that's what it's gonna take to make sense of this mess.
[Groan] Every time I try to define what we are, we just end up, uh, making out instead of talking. [Laugh] [Happy] Maybe that's our answer?
Oh god, you heard about—okay, I was gonna tell you, I swear. It just—everything happened so fast and I meant to text you but then—wait, who told you?
No, no you're right. It doesn't. I just—I feel terrible, okay? Like genuinely awful. We were all hanging out and someone mentioned the beach house and suddenly everyone was making plans and I kept thinking I should call you but—[groan] that sounds so lame now.
I know, I know. I'm the worst friend ever. But honestly, it wasn't like we deliberately excluded you or anything. It was more like—okay that's not better. Um. I'm making this worse, aren't I?
That was—okay yeah, that looks bad. Really bad. [nervous laugh] But it was supposed to be temporary! Just to figure out dates and then I was gonna add you once we had the basics down because you know how chaotic those big group chats get and I thought—I dunno, I thought I was being helpful?
No no no, not leaving you out! More like—wait wait, let me explain properly. You know how you hate when everyone's talking over each other making plans? I wanted to have something concrete before I brought it to you. But then—then it kinda snowballed and suddenly everyone was booking flights and I realized how badly I'd messed up.
I know. God, when you put it like that it sounds—it is terrible. I kept meaning to tell you, literally every day I'd think "I gotta text them" but then I'd psyche myself out because I knew you'd be upset and the longer I waited the worse it got and—that's not an excuse. I'm not trying to make excuses.
You're right. You're—you're totally right. [sigh] I'm doing that thing where I talk and talk instead of just saying sorry, aren't I? I'm sorry. Like really, genuinely sorry. I should've included you from the start.
What? What do you—oh. Oh, the concert thing. And the—yeah. Okay. I see it now. I keep doing this, don't I? Making decisions for the group without asking you. I didn't even realize I was—no, that's a lie. Part of me knew. I just... I guess I thought I was being efficient or something but really I was just being a crappy friend.
You shouldn't have to. That's—you're part of this group, you know? Like, you're important to us. To me. And I've been treating you like you're not and that's—[quieter] I'm really, really sorry. Can we—can we figure out a way to fix this? I wanna fix this.
Yes. Yes, absolutely. Starting right now—actually, everyone's meeting tomorrow to finalize stuff and you should—you should totally be there. I mean, if you want. And maybe we can talk about, like, how to make sure this doesn't happen again? Because I don't wanna lose you as a friend over me being an idiot.
Oh my god, wait—that's huge! That's like, that's such an honor, right? How are you—I mean, how are you feeling about it?
No no no, totally, I get that. It's like—it's not just some random title, y'know? There's actual, um, responsibilities and stuff. When did she ask you?
She—wait, she asked you in front of everyone? [Groan] That's so much pressure! Like, what are you supposed to say, right? "Let me think about it" while grandma's watching?
Of course you did! I mean, what else could you—but okay, okay, so now you're kinda freaking out about what you agreed to?
Oh. Oh yeah, that's—hmm. Does your sister know that? Because like, isn't there usually some whole religious ceremony thing?
Right, because you're actually—you're actually thinking about what it means, which is honestly really thoughtful. Most people just, y'know, show up and smile for photos.
Okay wait wait wait—that's like, that's the worst-case scenario though. [Softer] But I get it, you're taking it seriously, which is... actually kinda beautiful?
No, I mean it! Like, you could just be buying presents and showing up for birthdays, but you're actually thinking about—about being there, really being there if they need you.
Oh stop, that's—that's not true and you know it. You're literally the most responsible person I know. Remember when you, um, when you watched my cat for like three weeks? [Chuckle] He was basically your son.
Okay fine, but still! Look, being scared about this just means you understand how important it is. That's—that's exactly why your sister picked you, y'know? Not in spite of the overthinking. Because of it.
I—okay, yes, that happened, but I told you I was nervous about meeting all your work friends and you just kinda... left me there with strangers while you played host.
That's not—[sigh] I didn't plan to get wasted, okay? People kept offering me drinks and I didn't wanna be that weird person who keeps saying no, and I was trying to like, loosen up, y'know?
And I'm sorry about that, I am, but honestly? You embarrassed me first. You literally introduced me as your "friend from high school" and then ditched me. Not your best friend, not—just "friend from high school" like I'm nobody.
No, it doesn't, you're right. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like I just randomly decided to ruin your party. I was uncomfortable and I—I handled it badly, fine, but [frustrated laugh] you're not exactly innocent here either.
Look look, I get why you're mad, I do. But you invited me to this thing knowing I don't do well with those kinds of people, and then you basically abandoned me to go network or whatever. What was I supposed to do?
I wasn't blackout—okay okay, I was really drunk, but I remember most of it. And yeah, throwing up was... that was bad. But come on, you've been way worse at my birthday last year.
How? How is that different? Because it wasn't in front of your fancy work friends? Because it didn't affect your image or whatever? That's—that's pretty messed up actually.
And I'm sorry about the professional thing, seriously, but I'm also kinda hurt that you care more about what those people think than about why your supposed best friend was drinking that much in the first place. [scoff] Like, did you even wonder why?
Yeah, I am an adult, and adults make mistakes sometimes. I dunno what you want me to say here—I already said I was sorry about the couch, I'll pay for cleaning, but I'm not gonna grovel because I had anxiety and dealt with it wrong.
No, see, this is what you always do. You get all cold and shut down instead of actually talking about what's really bothering you. Fine fine, be mad, but don't pretend like this is all on me when you know—you know you could've handled things differently too.
Wait wait wait—what? The big one? The one you've been like, completely stressing about for months?
Oh my god, oh my god! This is—I mean, this is huge! How much are we talking here? Actually wait, is that rude to ask? [Laugh] I don't care, tell me everything!
Three hundred—okay, I'm gonna need you to like, show some emotion here because that's literally life-changing money! Aren't you excited?
No no no, I get it, I totally get it. It's like—when something this big happens, you kinda go numb first, right? [Sigh] God, I'm so proud of you though.
Okay but like—can we just, can we celebrate for one second? You've been working on this forever! All those late nights, all those rewrites you were complaining about...
Dinner? Babe, this is champagne territory! This is like—I mean, you basically just got validated by the entire scientific community, y'know?
Just money for—are you kidding me right now? Do you know how many people applied for this thing? Actually, wait, you told me. [Groan] It was like hundreds, wasn't it?
See? See, that's what I'm talking about! Out of four hundred people, they picked you. That's... honestly that's kinda making me emotional and it's not even my grant!
I'm being—okay fine, maybe a little, but like... you gotta understand, watching you doubt yourself all this time was rough, y'know? And now look!
Yeah yeah, of course, but—hey. Before you go all business mode on me... you did it. You actually did it. Just let that sink in for a sec, okay?
I know, I know it has, okay? But you're acting like I'm just—like I forgot about it or something. I didn't forget, I just... things have been really tight, you know that.
Yeah, well, I thought it would be two weeks! I wasn't lying to you, I legitimately thought I'd have it by then. But then my hours got cut and—[sigh]—look, I'm not making excuses, I'm just telling you what happened.
That's—okay, that's not fair. Those were like forty bucks, and it was my birthday. I'm supposed to just never do anything nice for myself? Come on.
No, that's—you're twisting it. The money I owe you isn't the same as—I mean, I still gotta live my life. You're making it sound like I'm out here throwing money around when I'm literally eating ramen every night.
And I feel terrible about that, okay? I do. But you—you said it was fine, that you weren't in a rush. Now suddenly you're acting like I scammed you or something. [frustrated laugh] That's not what this was.
I don't—I dunno, maybe next month? I'm trying, alright? I've got like three bills overdue right now, my car needs fixing, and you're—honestly, you're not the only person I owe money to.
See, this is what I mean. You're being all—all cold and judgmental when you know, you know what I'm dealing with. My mom's medical bills, the layoffs... I'm drowning here and you're mad about concert tickets.
And I thought I could! God, I—I really thought I could. [scoff] But yeah, fine, I messed up. Is that what you wanna hear? I messed up and now we're both broke and you hate me for it.
Well I don't have it! I literally don't have it. So I guess we're—I dunno, we're stuck, aren't we? Unless you want me to sell my blood or something.
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Fine. I'll—I'll check with you next time I wanna spend five dollars on coffee too. Look, I'm gonna pay you back, alright? I am. Just... gimme some time. Please.
[nervously] Did you check the slides again? [faster] I swear I saw a typo on slide fourteen—or was it fifteen? [Sharp inhale] We present in thirty minutes and I can't remember if I fixed the revenue projections from yesterday's edit.
[trembling] My hands won't stop shaking. [more urgently] What if Davidson asks about the Q3 metrics that we don't have yet? [Gulp] He always asks the one question we're not prepared for—remember last quarter's disaster?
[high-pitched] The conference room's projector was broken yesterday—did anyone fix it? [Shaky breath] I can't do this presentation on my tiny laptop screen. [desperately] Maybe we should just call in sick, both of us, right now.
[whimpering] I practiced all night but now I can't remember my opening line. [Gasping breath] It's like my brain just deleted everything! [more frantically] Do you have the backup notes? Please tell me you printed the backup notes.
[quavering voice] My mouth is so dry I can barely speak. [Nervous giggle] What if my voice cracks during the important part? [hushed] Everyone will think we're incompetent—they're probably already placing bets on our failure right now.
[quietly] You're right, we've prepared for weeks. [building confidence] The content is solid even if we're falling apart. [wavering] Though I still might need you to take over if I completely freeze up there.
[in a hollow voice] This is it then. [Nervous chuckle] Time to pretend we're competent professionals who definitely aren't dying inside. [whispered] Remember to smile—but not too much or they'll know we're faking it completely.
[suddenly urgent] Wait, which version of the budget did you upload? [panicking] The one with the corrections or the draft? [Strangled gasp] Please don't tell me we're about to present completely wrong information to the entire leadership team.
[resigned] It doesn't matter now, we're out of time. [Hollow laugh] Whatever happens, at least we'll go down together in this corporate nightmare. [firmly] Let's just walk in there and pretend everything is absolutely perfect.
[breathlessly] Okay, walking to the conference room now. [more quietly] My legs feel like jelly but I'm moving forward. [Shaky inhale] Just remember, if I pass out, tell them it's part of the dramatic effect.
[professionally] Thank you for contacting FastPass Support regarding violation notice TRL-892347-X. [confused] I'm, uh, having difficulty understanding your concern—[more clearly] are you disputing the vehicle color listed on your toll violation from Highway 47?
[patiently] I can see account EZ-5739-ALPHA in our system, thank you. [more firmly] To clarify—you're saying your vehicle is burgundy, not silver as listed? [helpful tone] I'll need your license plate number to investigate this violation from Tuesday at mile marker 23.7.
[relieved] Perfect, I've located plate 4XM92KP in our system. [increasingly concerned] There's definitely a discrepancy here—your registered 2019 Honda Accord is listed as burgundy, [sighs] but the violation photo from 3:47 PM Tuesday shows what appears to be a silver Toyota Camry.
[understanding] Oh! You're suggesting someone has duplicate plates matching yours. [more seriously] This is actually a serious issue—plate cloning. [reassuringly] If you were at 482 Oak Street at 3:47 PM, do you have any proof like a receipt or security footage we could reference?
[relieved] Excellent! Transaction JC-20240315-1647 at 3:47 PM would indeed prove you weren't at the toll plaza. [professionally] I'm escalating this to our fraud department as case #FRD-098234. [warmly] We'll void violation TRL-892347-X and investigate the plate cloning issue—expect a follow-up within 48 hours.
[concerned] Three additional violations under your plate number? [typing tone] Let me pull those up... yes, I see them here, all from this week. [more decisively] Given the confirmed fraud on FRD-098234, I'm flagging all four violations for review immediately.
[reassuringly] Your account balance of $127.43 will remain untouched—we're placing a hold on all disputed charges. [more firmly] That's $140 in base violations plus $67.80 in late fees, all suspended. [helpfully] We'll also add a fraud alert flag to account EZ-5739-ALPHA.
[thoughtfully] That's an excellent point about other toll agencies. [proactively] I'll notify Bay Bridge Authority and Golden State Expressway about the plate cloning through our inter-agency alert system. [sighs] Unfortunately, each agency handles their own violations, so you may need to contact them directly.
[efficiently] I've created inter-agency alert INTER-7823-ALERT and distributed it to seven regional toll authorities. [more carefully] Each agency should flag plate 4XM92KP for manual review before issuing violations. [reassuringly] You'll receive confirmation emails at the address on file within the hour.
[advisingly] Yes, absolutely file form REG-14-B for replacement plates—that's the smartest move. [helpfully] The DMV can expedite it with our fraud case number FRD-098234 as reference. [warmly] Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or these violations?
[professionally] Good afternoon, Dr. Martinez's office, this is Rachel speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today?
[sympathetically] Oh, I understand your frustration, let me just... [briskly] pull up your file here. [pause] Can you verify your date of birth and the specialist you were referred to?
[apologetically] I see the notes here about your previous calls. [quickly] The referral was sent on the tenth, but it looks like—[hesitant] well, there might have been an insurance verification delay.
[defensively] Sir, I understand you're upset, but we process dozens of referrals daily and [more firmly] sometimes the specialist's office takes time to—[quickly] actually, let me call them right now while you're on hold.
[reassuringly] I'm going to place you on a brief hold—two minutes maximum—and [more briskly] I'll contact Dr. Chen's scheduling department directly. [firmly] We'll get this sorted today, I promise.
[pause] Actually sir, I'm looking at your file more closely here. [surprised] It shows Dr. Chen's office sent us a request for additional medical records [quickly] on the twenty-second, but we never... responded?
[apologetically] This is absolutely our error, and I'm so sorry. [more quickly] I'm marking this as urgent priority right now, and [determined] I will personally fax those records within the next ten minutes.
[professionally] Absolutely, I'll email you a confirmation with a tracking number for the referral. [quickly] Also, I'm giving you my direct extension—[clearly] two two seven—so you can reach me personally for updates.
[confidently] I'm putting a flag in our system to alert me of any incoming requests from Dr. Chen's office. [more reassuringly] Plus, I'll call them after I send the fax to [briskly] confirm receipt and get you a tentative appointment date.
[efficiently] I'll call you back within two hours with confirmation, and [quickly] Dr. Chen's office typically schedules within forty-eight hours of receiving completed referrals. [warmly] I've noted your cell number here—is that still the best way to reach you?
[Disappointed] Look, I just—I don't have that, um, that maternal instinct everyone talks about, you know? [Sigh] It's not there.
[Happy] Honestly, I love my freedom too much! [Laugh] Like, I can just pack up and go to Thailand tomorrow if I want.
[Fast] People keep saying "you'll change your mind" but I'm thirty-five and still waiting for this magical transformation, so... [Sarcastic] [Tsk]
[Angry] Why does everyone act like I'm—like I'm broken or something just because I don't wanna reproduce? [Groan]
[Slow] The planet's kinda, uh, dying? [Sad] And bringing a kid into this mess feels... I dunno, cruel maybe.
[Whisper] Between you and me, I can barely take care of myself most days. [Chuckle] A tiny human would be a disaster.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me just give up my career I worked fifteen years for to, what, watch Bluey all day? [Disappointed]
[Happy] My sister has three kids and honestly—wait, don't tell her this—but it looks absolutely exhausting. [Fast] [Laugh]
[Shout] It's my body! [Angry] I get to decide what happens with it, right?
[Sad] I grew up in a really messed up family and I'm just—I'm terrified I'd repeat those patterns, y'know? [Sigh]
[Slow] Have you seen how much college costs now? [Disappointed] [Groan] It's like a quarter million dollars or something insane.
[Fast] Okay so basically my friend just had a baby and she literally hasn't slept in—what, three months? [Whisper] She looks dead inside.
[Happy] I mean, I've got twelve houseplants and I've killed, um, probably half of them, so... [Chuckle] [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Yeah, 'cause what I really need is someone screaming at 3 AM when I finally got my insomnia under control. [Angry]
[Disappointed] The thing is—actually, you know what? [Slow] I just don't want them, and that should be enough of a reason.
[Sad] My partner and I, we're—we're not even sure we'll make it, honestly. [Sigh] Adding a kid would be... yeah.
[Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm just too selfish for it, but then I think—wait, isn't that self-aware at least? [Fast]
[Shout] Can we please stop pretending pregnancy is beautiful? [Angry] [Groan] It literally rearranges your organs!
[Happy] I've got, like, seventeen godchildren already, okay? [Laugh] I get to spoil them and send them home—it's perfect!
[Slow] You wanna know the real reason? [Sad] I'm scared I'd love them so much it would break me, and I can't—I just can't risk that.
What? No, I—wait, what did I forget? Oh god, was it the—oh NO. The allergy thing. The peanut allergy thing, I totally forgot when I brought those cookies to your sister's party, didn't I?
I know, I know, you have, and I just—my brain is like swiss cheese lately, y'know? That's not an excuse, I'm not making excuses, I'm just... [groan] I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did it again.
Oh my god. Oh my god, is she okay? Wait wait wait—she had to actually use it? I thought—I mean, I didn't think—god, I'm such an idiot. Is she at the hospital? Should I—can I do something?
I'm gonna—I'll pay for the EpiPen replacement, obviously. And the hospital bills if there are any. I just... I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. [nervous laugh] Like, you literally tell me every single time and I still somehow manage to mess it up.
Yeah. Yeah, you do. And I—I write it down sometimes, but then I forget to check what I wrote, or I leave the list at home, or I just... I dunno, I get distracted? That sounds so stupid when I say it out loud.
I know it could've. That's the—that's the worst part, right? Like, this isn't forgetting your birthday or something. This is serious, life-threatening stuff and I just... treated it like it was nothing. No no no, not like it was nothing, but like—ugh, I'm not explaining this right.
I guess I just—okay, so in my head, I know it's important. Super important. But then I'm at the store and I see these amazing cookies and I'm thinking "oh she'll love these" and somehow the allergy thing just... disappears? [sigh] Even though you've told me literally a hundred times.
No, it's not. It's really, really not, and that's—that's what makes me feel even worse about it, honestly. Like, one thing. You ask me to remember one thing and I can't even... I keep failing you. And her. I'm so sorry.
Wait, please—don't say that. I'm gonna—I'm gonna set reminders on my phone. Like, multiple reminders. And I'll put a note in my wallet, and my car, and—basically everywhere. I know I've probably said this before but this time I really—I can't lose you over this. I can't.
I know. I know I did. But seeing her have to use that EpiPen because of me? That's—I can't get that image out of my head. I swear to you, I will never, NEVER bring anything with peanuts near her again. Or tree nuts. Or any nuts. Just... please give me one more chance?
I—okay, yeah, I did, but honestly? I thought he had a point. Like, I'm sorry, but I genuinely thought you were being kinda unreasonable about the whole thing.
Don't do that. Don't just—look, I wasn't trying to gang up on you or whatever you're thinking. I just... when he explained his perspective, it made sense to me. [Sigh] That doesn't mean I don't care about your feelings.
I am your friend! But that doesn't mean I'm gonna automatically agree with everything you do. That's not—friends can disagree, y'know? I'm allowed to have my own opinion about stuff.
What, so I'm supposed to just sit there and nod along even when I think you're wrong? Come on. That's not fair and you know it. I wasn't being malicious, I was being honest.
That wasn't—[frustrated laugh]—okay, I get that it felt that way, but I wasn't trying to embarrass you. I was literally just saying what I thought. And honestly? Maybe you needed to hear it from someone who actually cares about you.
See, this is what I mean. You're being—you're acting like I betrayed you or something when all I did was disagree. Like, I'm sorry it hurt your feelings, okay? But I'm not gonna apologize for having an opinion.
Then what—what is it about? Because from where I'm standing, it seems like you're mad that I didn't just blindly take your side, which is kinda... I dunno, it's kinda messed up actually.
Loyalty doesn't mean—ugh, loyalty doesn't mean never calling you out when you're wrong. [Scoff] If anything, a real friend tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Especially then.
I—okay, okay, maybe. Maybe I should've. But it came up in the moment and I just... I said what I thought. And honestly? I still think Jake was right about most of it.
No, don't—don't do that. We're still friends, alright? Just because I disagree with you on one thing doesn't mean I'm choosing him over you or whatever narrative you're building in your head. I just... I thought you were wrong this time. That's it.
Okay, so—wait wait wait, before you get mad, just let me explain. I didn't think he was gonna be that bad, I swear. Like, when I met him at Katie's thing, he seemed totally normal.
I know! I know, that's—[nervous laugh]—that's completely insane. But like, how was I supposed to know he'd do that? He never mentioned being, y'know, that attached to her.
Oh god, she did? He didn't—okay that's worse than I thought. I'm so, so sorry. Honestly, I had no idea he was gonna—I mean, who even does that?
No no no, I didn't—okay, fine. [sigh] I maybe kinda knew he was a little quirky? But I thought quirky could be good! You're always saying you want someone different, and I just—I dunno, I thought maybe different would work.
He what? Oh my god, I'm—I'm literally dying inside right now. That's not quirky, that's—yeah, that's something else entirely. I really really messed up here.
I wasn't trying to—look, Katie said he was just shy! And you know how you sometimes intimidate guys, so I thought maybe someone more, um, gentle would be—actually never mind, that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.
No! That's not—that's not what I meant at all. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? I just wanted you to be happy and I thought—I dunno what I thought. I'm an idiot, basically.
I wanna make it up to you, okay? Like, whatever you want—drinks are on me for the next month, or—or I'll never set you up again, which honestly might be the better option here.
She WHAT? No no no, that's—okay I'm gonna need therapy just from hearing about this secondhand. I am so, so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I promise I'll screen people better—actually, y'know what? No more setups. Ever.
Yes! Absolutely, done. As many drinks as it takes to forget this ever happened. And I'm—I'm really sorry. I know I'm terrible at this matchmaking thing, but I just—I care about you, y'know? Even if I'm apparently the worst at showing it.
Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm literally the worst friend right now, I get it. But Jake had this thing come up and I—wait, that's not even a good excuse, is it?
No no no, you're right, you're totally right. I've been—I've been that person, haven't I? The one who just disappears when they get a boyfriend and I always said I'd never—[groan] I'm doing exactly what I hate.
I didn't mean to blow you off, honestly. Time just kinda... gets away from me lately? Like I'll think it's Tuesday and suddenly it's Thursday and I've missed our coffee thing again and—that sounds so stupid when I say it out loud.
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. You've been nothing but supportive about Jake and I've been—I've basically been taking you for granted, haven't I? [nervous laugh] God, I suck.
Um... I dunno, maybe—actually wait, let me think. There was the movie night, and brunch, and—oh. Oh wow. That's... that's like six times? Seven? And I canceled every single—yeah, okay, I see it now.
Eight. Jesus. That's—I didn't realize it was that bad. I mean, I knew I'd been flaky but eight times? That's not flaky, that's just... that's being a terrible friend.
Of course I remember—you literally held my hair back when I was crying so hard I threw up. You brought me ice cream at 2 AM. You—[sigh] you've always been there and I just... dropped you the second something good happened to me.
Can we—would you wanna maybe get dinner tomorrow? Just us, I promise. No Jake, no distractions, I'll literally turn my phone off. I know I know, I don't deserve it after being such a crap friend but I miss you. I miss us.
I did, didn't I? And then I—god, I bailed for that stupid concert. Look, what if you pick the place and the time and I just—I'll be there. Early, even. I'll be there stupidly early with your favorite coffee as an apology bribe.
Yeah. Yeah, me too. I want—I wanna be that friend again, y'know? The one you could actually count on. I got so caught up in the new relationship butterflies that I forgot what actually matters and that's... that's on me. Completely on me.
Oh. Oh no, is this—wait, are you upset with me? Because I feel like you've been kinda distant lately and I wasn't sure if I did something or—
I don't—what do you mean? [nervous laugh] I mean, I know I talk a lot but I'm not really following what you're getting at here.
Wait wait wait, that's not—okay maybe I do sometimes offer suggestions but it's only because I care! Like, I see you struggling with stuff and I just wanna help, y'know?
But you—you vent to me about things! And I thought that meant—I mean, aren't friends supposed to help each other? I'm honestly confused because I thought that's what we do.
Oh. Oh god. [groan] You're right. You're totally right. I just—I always jump straight into fix-it mode, don't I? Like you can't even finish a sentence without me being all "you should do this" or "have you tried that."
I know, I know. That was—yeah, that was way too much. You were literally just telling me about your bad day and I turned it into this whole thing about updating your resume and—god, I'm that friend, aren't I? The one who can't just shut up and listen.
I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. I didn't realize I was doing it that much—actually no, that's a lie. Part of me kinda knew but I kept telling myself I was being helpful.
You're right. You're absolutely right and I—[sigh] I think maybe I do it because giving advice makes me feel useful? Like if I can't fix my own mess of a life, at least I can pretend to have answers for yours. Which is super messed up, I know.
I can do that. I mean, I'm gonna try really hard to do that. Would it help if—actually, no, see? There I go again trying to solve it. Just... tell me when I'm doing it, okay? Call me out.
Every single time. I mean it. I don't wanna lose you as a friend over my big mouth. You matter more to me than being right or—or whatever need I'm filling by being everyone's unwanted therapist.
SCENARIO: waiting for the dryer to finish
[sniffling] I can't believe Mom kept all our kindergarten drawings. [voice breaking] Look at this one—you drew me as a potato with stick legs. [shaky laugh] I remember being so mad, but now I'd frame it forever.
[wailing] Remember when we carved our initials under this windowsill? [quieter] We thought we were being so rebellious. [sobbing harder] Dad knew the whole time but never said anything until last week when he mentioned it casually.
[trembling whisper] This closet still smells like your strawberry body spray from middle school. [louder, crying] You practically fumigated our room with it every morning. [choking up] Now I'll probably buy a bottle just to remember this place.
[barely audible] Found the friendship bracelet you made me in fourth grade. [voice rising hysterically] The one I swore I lost at summer camp! [gulping air] It was wedged behind my bed frame this whole time, perfectly preserved.
[rapid, panicking] What about the height marks on the doorframe? [slower] Every birthday, every first day of school. [long wail] The new family will just paint over our entire growth history like we never even existed here.
[nostalgic crying] Remember our secret knock? [demonstrating rhythm] Tap-tap-pause-tap-tap-tap. [voice faltering] We haven't used it in years but my hand still remembers exactly how hard to hit the door to make it echo right.
[determined] We should take a piece of the wallpaper from behind the dresser. [more softly] The part where we measured ourselves lying down. [snorting] You always cheated by pointing your toes but I never called you out.
[accusingly upset] You're taking the music box, right? [gentler] The one Grandma gave us to share but you always kept on your nightstand? [pleading] Please take it—I can't bear thinking of it in donation somewhere.
[philosophical sadness] Maybe the walls absorbed all our fights and make-ups and midnight conversations. [hopeful] Maybe they'll whisper our stories to whoever sleeps here next. [breaking down] God, that's stupid, walls don't remember anything, do they?
[defeated] I can't do the last corner, where we built the blanket fort. [trembling] Where you held me after my first heartbreak. [steadier] Let's just leave it exactly as it is—our final rebellion against growing up.
[patiently] Actually, Mr. Henderson, that's standard procedure. [reassuring] The 287-B is just your foundation inspection certificate, and [more clearly] once we verify completion of phase one—roughly 20% of your $225,000 loan—we release those funds.
[professionally] Well, typically contractors understand our draw schedule system. [more firmly] According to your file, account number JX-4429-B, you have five scheduled draws. [helpfully] The difference between what Dave needs and what we release—that's where your down payment comes in.
[calmly] Those reserves, that's $22,500 set aside for unexpected costs. [more enthusiastically] Think of it as your safety net! [explaining] You can't touch it unless you submit variance form VF-19 with documented overages.
[sympathetically] I understand the frustration, but these inspections protect you. [more seriously] Inspector badge number 7792, Jim Wallace, he's assigned to your region. [reassuringly] Usually he can complete inspections within 48 to 72 hours of request.
[apologetically] Unfortunately, our guidelines under regulation CC-2019.3 don't allow combined draws. [more gently] However, if your contractor completes work faster than expected, [optimistically] we can sometimes expedite with rush code R-11, though that's a $250 fee per occurrence.
[apologetically] Hey, so... I know we were supposed to be there at nine this morning. [sighs heavily] The truck broke down on the highway, and we're—we're still waiting for the tow. [more quietly] I'm really sorry about this.
[defensive] Look, I understand you're frustrated, I really do. [quickly] We've had a rough week—two guys quit, equipment issues, and now this. [more softly] Can we reschedule for tomorrow afternoon?
[hurried] Okay, okay, I hear you. [briskly] What if I personally guarantee to be there myself, first thing Saturday morning? [more earnestly] No crew, just me, and I'll knock twenty percent off the labor.
[quickly] The roof—right, the emergency repair. [more urgently] Listen, I can get my brother-in-law there today, he's excellent with roofing. [reassuring] He'll at least tarp it temporarily until we can do the full job.
[hurt] Those reviews are real, I swear. [defensively] We've just hit a bad patch this month, and you're—you're catching the worst of it. [pleading] Give me one more chance to make this right.
[Fast] Okay so, I walk in there, right, and everyone just stops talking—like, dead silence. [Tsk] It was so obvious they'd been talking about me.
[Slow] You gotta understand something here... I've never, um, I've never done anything like that before in my entire life. [Sigh]
[Angry] She literally said—and I'm quoting here—that I was being "dramatic"! [Shout] Me! Can you believe that?
[Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda knew something was off when he wouldn't look me in the eye. [Chuckle] Should've trusted my gut.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, apparently I'm the bad guy for, uh, for actually showing up on time. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Makes total sense.
[Happy] And then—wait, this is the best part—he actually apologized! [Laugh] Like, genuinely said he was wrong!
[Sad] I dunno, maybe I should've just... kept my mouth shut, y'know? [Slow] Maybe none of this would've happened.
Was I supposed to just stand there and—actually, you know what? [Fast] [Angry] Yes, I said what I said and I meant every word.
[Disappointed] The whole thing was basically a misunderstanding, but, um, nobody wanted to hear my side. [Sigh] Still don't, apparently.
[Whisper] [Fast] I'm gonna tell you something but you can't—you absolutely cannot tell anyone else, okay?
[Chuckle] Honestly? Looking back, it's kinda funny how worked up everyone got over, like, literally nothing. [Happy]
[Slow] Three times. [Angry] I asked him three times to just... to just listen for one second. [Groan]
[Sarcastic] Right, because I definitely woke up that morning thinking "hey, let's ruin everyone's day!" [Tsk] [Disappointed] That's exactly what I wanted.
[Fast] [Happy] No no no, wait—I forgot the part where she tried to blame it on the dog! The dog!
[Sad] [Whisper] I mean, if I could go back and—I dunno, maybe I wouldn't change anything actually.
[Shout] Twenty dollars! [Angry] We're having this whole argument over twenty stupid dollars! It's insane!
[Slow] You ever have one of those moments where you're like... this isn't actually happening to me right now? [Sigh] [Disappointed] Yeah.
[Happy] [Fast] So I just started laughing—couldn't help it—and that's when everyone realized how ridiculous we were being!
[Sarcastic] I'm sure my opinion doesn't matter, but, uh, since you asked so nicely... [Chuckle] Here's what really went down.
[Disappointed] Look, I tried to—actually, forget it. [Sad] [Sigh] You've already made up your mind about what happened anyway.
SCENARIO: Upset about a forgotten umbrella, then the rain stops completely
What? No! No no no, I wasn't—I mean, I was gonna bring it up, I just didn't know how to—um, I thought maybe you needed space?
Okay that came out wrong. I wasn't trying to avoid it, I swear. I just—you seemed really mad and I didn't wanna make it worse by bringing it up at the wrong time, y'know? [nervous laugh] But I guess acting normal was... also the wrong move.
I know, I know. That was—god, that was so stupid. I literally typed and deleted like fifteen different apologies before I just... panicked and sent the brunch thing instead.
Yeah. Yeah, that's—that's fair. [sigh] I kept overthinking it, like what if I said the wrong thing again? What if I made you more upset? But obviously avoiding it was worse. Way worse.
I know. And I'm—I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, deeply sorry. What I said was completely out of line and I didn't mean—actually, no, that doesn't matter. Impact over intent, right? I hurt you and that's what matters.
Because I'm—honestly? I'm terrible at confrontation. Like absolutely terrible. And I thought maybe if I just acted normal, we could kinda... ease back into being okay? [groan] Hearing it out loud, that's so dumb.
No! Oh my god, no, I care so much. I've been—I've literally been losing my mind about this for three days. Ask my roommate, I've been a complete mess. I just didn't know how to—how to fix it without making everything worse.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I should've—the second it happened, I should've apologized instead of getting defensive and then... whatever this was. Avoiding you? Pretending? I dunno what to even call it.
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. For Tuesday, for the weird texts, for acting like nothing happened—all of it. You didn't deserve any of that. You're like—you're one of my best friends and I completely fucked up.
I miss you too. So much. Can we—I mean, I know things aren't just magically fixed, but can we talk about it? Like actually talk? I wanna make this right. Whatever it takes.
I—what? That's how you're gonna start this conversation? Like, no "hey, how are you" or anything, just straight to attacking me?
Okay okay, so maybe I've been a little—I dunno, down or whatever, but you know what I'm dealing with right now. My dad's literally in the hospital and you're mad at me for not being sunshine and rainbows?
That's not—[scoff] I'm not taking anything out on anyone. I'm just trying to get through each day, and yeah, maybe I'm not exactly fun to be around, but I thought you'd understand.
Absorb my—wow. Okay. So basically what you're saying is I'm like, toxic or something? That's really what you think of me right now?
But it's what you meant, right? Look look, I get that I've been—I haven't been great company lately, fine. But you're acting like I'm doing this on purpose. Like I wake up and choose to be miserable around you.
That's—honestly, that's kind of hurtful. [frustrated laugh] I mean, I'm sorry I can't just compartmentalize my entire life for your comfort, but that's not how this works.
Try? Try what exactly? To pretend everything's fine? You know what, I have been trying. Every single day I try not to completely fall apart, and apparently that's still not good enough for you.
I don't—okay, maybe sometimes I do that, but it's not intentional. It's just hard to see anything positive when literally everything feels like it's falling apart. I'm not trying to bring everyone down with me, I'm just... struggling.
Because—because I don't need you to fix this, okay? [sigh] I just need you to be my friend. And instead you're here basically telling me I'm too much of a downer to be around.
Yeah well, neither is this whole conversation. You know what, I'm sorry I'm not handling my crisis the right way for you. I'll just—I'll try to be less negative or whatever. Fine.
SCENARIO: trying to remember the name of that song stuck in their head
[sniffling] Oh my god, Sarah, look at this one. [voice breaking] The little girl doesn't even recognize him at first, and then— [Sobbing breath] And then she just runs into his arms screaming "Daddy!"
[high-pitched crying] Why do we do this to ourselves? [more shakily] We could be watching literally anything else right now, but no—here we are, mascara completely destroyed, watching our fifteenth military reunion video today.
[trembling whisper] The dog ones get me too. [louder crying] That German Shepherd who hadn't seen his owner for two years? [Choked sob] He knocked him over and wouldn't stop licking his face!
[between sobs] Wait, wait, here comes another one. [increasingly hysterical] It's a surprise at a wedding—oh no, the bride doesn't know her brother's home! [Wailing cry] She's walking down the aisle and he's just standing there!
[quavering] We said this last time, remember? [sniffling harder] "No more soldier videos," we promised ourselves after that one with the classroom surprise. [Shuddering breath] Yet here we are, emotionally torturing ourselves again on a Tuesday night.
[whimpering] Look at this comment—someone said their dad never came home. [completely breaking down] Now I'm crying about the video AND the comments! [Sob] Why did I scroll down? Why do I always scroll down?
[barely coherent] The grandmother one is starting—she's ninety-three! [voice rising] She thinks he's still deployed but he's right behind her! [Ugly crying] She keeps saying "I prayed every night" over and over!
[exhausted crying] My face hurts from crying. [snorting laugh-cry] We look absolutely insane—red, blotchy, snot everywhere. [Hiccup] If anyone walked in right now, they'd think we got terrible news or something.
[steadying breath] Okay, last one, I promise. [immediately crying again] No wait, it's twins finding out daddy's home! [Squealing sob] They're in their little matching pajamas running down the hallway!
[sighing deeply] Same time next week? [more cheerfully] We can pretend we'll watch comedies instead, lie to ourselves about having self-control. [Soft chuckle] Then end up here again, destroying ourselves with wholesome military content.
[apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, but when I search RX47B92K in our system, nothing comes up. [calmly] Could you perhaps check if maybe, um, you booked with a different company? [hesitant] Sometimes customers confuse us with Enterprise or Hertz.
[defensive] Well, sir, I'm looking at every reservation for today, March 15th, and there's no booking under your name. [more firmly] Could you spell your last name again? [sighs] Maybe it's under a different spelling or your corporate account?
[typing tone] Okay, I see you in our system as a Gold member, but... [confused] the last reservation I show was in January, confirmation AZ66M10P. [more apologetically] Sir, are you absolutely certain you received a confirmation email from us?
[defensive] Sir, there's no need for that tone. [more calmly] Let me try searching by your credit card—the last four digits? [sighs heavily] Sometimes the system, well, it doesn't sync properly between online and our counter.
[surprised] Oh wait—I think I... [hesitant] Sir, did you book for March 15th or May 15th? [nervously] Because I'm seeing RX47B92K here but it's showing for May, not March. [quietly] That would explain everything.
[cheerfully] Good afternoon, thank you for calling TechNet Support, my name is Sarah. [quickly] How can I assist you with your internet service today?
[sympathetically] I understand how frustrating that must be, sir. [briskly] Let me pull up your account real quick—can I have your account number or the phone number associated with your service?
[professionally] Alright Mr. Johnson, I see your account here. [quickly] Now, according to our system, there aren't any reported outages in your area, but [more carefully] I do notice you've exceeded your monthly data allowance.
[apologetically] I understand the confusion, sir. [rapidly] The unlimited plan doesn't cut off your service, but after 1 terabyte of usage, [more slowly] speeds may be reduced during peak network congestion periods.
[reassuringly] I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Johnson. [briskly] Let me check if we have any other plans that might better suit your usage needs—actually, [more enthusiastically] we do have a business tier with no throttling whatsoever.
[warmly] Your loyalty absolutely matters to us, sir. [quickly] What I can do right now is reset your current cycle—that'll restore your speeds immediately, [more quietly] and I'll add a courtesy credit of thirty dollars.
[confidently] Great question—let me offer you our Speed Boost add-on. [rapidly] It's just fifteen dollars extra monthly, but it doubles your priority data to 2 terabytes, [encouragingly] and most customers never hit that threshold.
[sympathetically] I know it seems that way, Mr. Johnson. [more earnestly] But between you and me, the Speed Boost really is worth it—[quickly] especially if you're working from home and streaming.
[enthusiastically] Perfect, I'll add that right away! [briskly] You'll see the speed improvement within the next five minutes, and [reassuringly] I'm also noting your account for priority support going forward.
[confidently] It's absolutely real, sir—you'll have a direct number that bypasses the main queue. [quickly] I'm also emailing you my direct extension, [more personally] just in case you need follow-up on this specific issue.
[Slow] I dunno, it's like, when I'm by myself, I can actually hear my own thoughts without all the—the noise, you know? [Sigh]
[Happy] Oh my god, yes, eating cereal for dinner while watching whatever I want—that's, that's freedom right there! [Laugh]
[Whisper] Sometimes I just need to, um, disappear for a while and not explain myself to anybody. [Slow] Is that so wrong?
[Sarcastic] Yeah, because apparently wanting five minutes without someone asking me "what's wrong" makes me antisocial. [Tsk] Sure, okay.
[Fast] Look, I'm not saying I hate people, I just—I recharge better when it's quiet, alright? [Disappointed] Nobody seems to get that.
[Angry] I'm so tired of having to justify this—like, why is it weird that I don't wanna hang out constantly? [Groan]
[Sad] The thing is—wait, how do I explain this—I feel more lonely in crowds than I ever do by myself. [Sigh]
[Chuckle] Honestly? [Happy] No pants, no problems—that's basically my whole philosophy right there.
[Slow] I can literally spend hours just, uh, thinking about stuff without anyone interrupting to ask what I'm thinking about. [Satisfied] [Sigh]
[Shout] Because I actually LIKE my own company! [Fast] Why is that so hard for everyone to understand?
[Whisper] You know those moments where everything just... stops? [Slow] I only get those when I'm completely alone.
[Disappointed] I mean, I tried the whole social thing, but it's—it's exhausting pretending to care about small talk. [Tsk]
[Fast] Okay so basically, when I'm alone I can sing badly, dance stupidly, and talk to my plants without judgment—it's great! [Laugh]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let me drop everything to attend another "mandatory fun" event. [Angry] That's exactly what I need. [Groan]
[Sad] People always assume I'm, like, broken or whatever because I choose this, but I'm not—I'm really not. [Whisper] I'm just different.
[Happy] You wanna know the best part? [Chuckle] I never have to compromise on pizza toppings—ever!
[Slow] There's this, um, this pressure to constantly perform when you're around others that just—[Sigh]—it melts away when you're alone.
[Angry] No, I don't need to "put myself out there more"—I'm perfectly fine in here, thanks! [Tsk] [Fast] God, why does everyone think they're my therapist?
[Disappointed] I guess I just thought by now people would stop treating "introvert" like it's some kinda disease that needs fixing. [Slow] But here we are.
[Whisper] The silence isn't empty, you know? [Happy] It's actually really full of, like, possibilities and peace and—and me, I guess. [Chuckle]
SCENARIO: Offhandedly mentioning a safety thing they skipped, then imagining what could have happened, then spiraling into retrospective near-miss dread
Oh. Um, yeah—look, I was gonna tell you about it, but it wasn't like a real party or anything. It was literally just my family, my mom planned the whole thing.
Don't—don't do that. Come on. You know how my parents are, they wanted this whole traditional family dinner thing and I couldn't just [sigh] invite people. It wasn't my call.
I mean, what was I supposed to say? "Hey, we're having this dinner but you can't come"? That seemed—honestly that seemed worse. I wasn't trying to hide it from you.
That's not—okay okay, fine, technically I didn't tell you, but it's not like I was being malicious about it. You're acting like I threw some huge party and deliberately excluded you.
It was my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, and like three cousins! That's it! I didn't even wanna—[frustrated laugh] half of them I barely talk to. You think I chose them over you?
Because I knew you'd react like this! And look—look, I'm sorry you're hurt, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're making my family dinner about you.
Yeah, actually, you are. My mom planned this whole thing, I had zero input, and now I gotta defend myself for—what? For having dinner with my relatives? That's not fair.
What did you want me to say? I was already stressed about the whole thing, my family was being—ugh, you know how they get. [scoff] I just didn't wanna deal with making you feel bad too.
I didn't lie! I just—I omitted it, fine, whatever. But honestly? The way you're reacting right now is exactly why I didn't bring it up. This isn't—this isn't how friends should handle stuff like this.
Okay, y'know what? Fine fine, be mad at me. But when you calm down and realize you're being kinda unreasonable about a family dinner—a family dinner—I'll still be here. Because that's what actual friends do.
SCENARIO: discovering their printer is out of ink
[Sharp gasp] WHAT?! [voice cracking] Oh my God, oh my God! [suddenly quiet] Wait, this is insane because I literally have a test in my purse right now. I've been too scared to take it alone.
[shaky breath] Okay, okay, I'm doing it. [determined] Three minutes never felt so long. [mumbling quickly] What if it's positive? What if it's negative? What if the test is broken? Oh God, my hands won't stop shaking!
[hysterical laugh] Don't make me laugh right now! [panicked whisper] Oh my God, it's been three minutes. [trembling] I can't look. You look for me. Please? Just tell me what you see. I can't do this.
[sobbing] I can't believe this! [laughing through tears] Our kids are going to be best friends! [getting louder] They're going to grow up together! Built-in playmates! Oh my God, we need to tell our husbands immediately!
[warmly] You're right, this moment is ours. [quiet amazement] Nine months from now, everything changes. [giggling softly] Can you imagine us pregnant at the same time? The mood swings alone will be legendary. Our poor, poor husbands.
[mock serious] Hold up, I call dibs on not finding out the gender. [playfully] You can find out yours if you want. [sing-song voice] But I want the surprise! Also, we're definitely getting those pregnancy pillows immediately.
[contemplative] You know what's crazy? [slowly] We always joked about doing everything together. [getting emotional] College, weddings, and now this. Sometimes I think we share the same cosmic timing or something. It's beautiful and terrifying.
[reassuring tone] Of course I'm scared! [firm voice] But we're doing this together, like always. [chuckling] Remember our pact from high school? [tenderly] "No major life event alone." Well, we're definitely keeping that promise now.
[breathless] Stop, you're going to make me cry again! [snorting laugh] My mascara is already ruined. [whimpering] But yes, they're getting the best aunt ever. Both of them. This is the beginning of everything.
[exhausted but happy] Yes to everything. [peaceful sigh] But first, let's just sit here another minute. [whispered awe] Two best friends, two babies, one incredible journey. [soft laugh] This is going to be the adventure of our lives.
[professionally] Thank you for calling, Mr. Richardson, let me pull up your account. [sympathetic] I see you're on our Premium Plus package with 240 channels. [reassuringly] Let's definitely get this resolved—are you seeing any error codes on your screen?
[understanding] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [in a helpful tone] Can you check the cable connection at the back of your box—model DCX3400, right? [more slowly] Sometimes a loose coaxial cable at the input port can cause this exact issue.
[pleased] Excellent! That's progress. [more enthusiastically] However, channels 51 through 58 might need a signal refresh from our end. [professionally] I'm sending that now—authorization code SR-9982-X should appear on your screen momentarily.
[warmly] We appreciate your loyalty, Mr. Richardson! [cheerfully] Since you've been with us four years, I can actually apply a $15 monthly discount. [more quietly] That'll bring your bill down to $112.99, retroactive for three months.
[enthusiastically] Those launch January 15th for all Premium Plus subscribers! [informatively] You'll get NFL RedZone on 505, NBA TV on 507. [friendly] Is there anything else I can help you with today, reference number TK-20231209-1847 for this call?
[cheerfully] Good afternoon, MealExpress customer service, this is Jamie speaking! [quickly] How can I assist you with your order today? [warmly] I'm here to help make things right.
[apologetically] Oh my goodness, I am so, so sorry about this recurring issue. [concerned] Let me just... pull up your account right away. [sighs] This is absolutely unacceptable on our part.
[quickly] No, no, this is definitely not a joke, and I completely understand your frustration. [more firmly] I'm escalating this to management immediately. [reassuringly] We'll get you a full refund plus a credit for future orders.
[briskly] Right, absolutely valid point there. [decisively] Here's what I'm doing—refunding all three orders, sending the correct meal within the hour. [more softly] And honestly? The credit's yours whether you use it or not.
[confidently] I'm personally flagging this with our kitchen supervisor right now—literally as we speak. [quickly] Red priority tag, double-checked by two people. [earnestly] Plus, I'm... I'm staying on until your order arrives correctly.
[warmly] Hey, no apologies needed—three wrong orders would make anyone upset! [chuckles softly] Between you and me? I'd probably have thrown the lasagna at someone by now. [more professionally] Your patience has been remarkable.
[quickly] We've had some issues with our new ordering system, unfortunately. [honestly] It's been... well, it's been mixing up dietary preferences. [firmly] But three times to the same customer? That's a special level of failure.
[laughing] A monument to our incompetence—I'm definitely sharing that with the team! [more seriously] But genuinely, your order's being prepared now. [reassuringly] Sarah, our best cook, is personally handling it.
[brightly] Message delivered to Sarah! [quickly] She says—and I quote—"Tell them the chicken's so good, they'll forget the lasagna nightmare." [confidently] Twenty-five minutes out now.
[proudly] That's what real service looks like! [briskly] Your driver Marcus is en route, should be there in fifteen now. [warmly] And hey—definitely keep my direct extension for any future issues.
[Laugh] Oh god, you heard that? I was just, um, testing the acoustics in here—totally not belting out show tunes or anything. [Fast] [Chuckle]
[Whisper] How long have you been standing there? [Slow] Because I may have done, like, choreography too.
[Sarcastic] Yeah, no, this is great—just what I needed, an audience for my shower performance. [Tsk]
[Happy] You know what? I don't even care anymore! [Shout] That song is a banger and I'm not gonna apologize!
[Disappointed] I specifically waited until everyone left so I could—ugh, this is so embarrassing. [Sigh]
[Fast] I wasn't singing, I was just, uh, clearing my throat in a very melodic way, okay?
[Sad] Please don't tell anyone about this—I'm literally gonna die if this gets out. [Groan] [Whisper] I'm begging you.
[Angry] Can't a person have five minutes of privacy in their own—wait, is that your phone? [Fast] You better not be recording this!
[Chuckle] Well, I mean, at least you caught me during the good part, right? [Happy] Could've been way worse, honestly.
[Slow] So... we're just gonna pretend this never happened? [Sarcastic] Because that would be super cool of you.
[Disappointed] And here I thought I was alone—guess the universe just loves to humble me, huh? [Tsk] [Sigh]
[Whisper] [Fast] Okay but like, you gotta admit, I kinda nailed that high note though?
[Shout] You scared the hell out of me! [Angry] [Groan] I almost had a heart attack—knock next time!
[Happy] [Laugh] Fine, you caught me! I'm basically a one-person concert when nobody's around, sue me!
[Sarcastic] Oh perfect, just perfect—now you know about my secret career as a, um, bathroom pop star. [Slow]
[Sad] This is literally my worst nightmare coming true right now. [Whisper] I can't even look at you.
[Fast] [Chuckle] That wasn't me, that was the, uh, the radio—yeah, the radio that sounds exactly like me somehow.
[Disappointed] I used to do this all the time before you moved in, and now I can't even—whatever, forget it. [Angry]
[Slow] You're smiling, so either you're impressed or you're gonna mock me forever. [Sigh] [Sarcastic] Can't wait to find out which one.
[Happy] [Fast] Actually, y'know what? Join me! We could do a duet—unless you're too cool for that or whatever.
SCENARIO: Upset about a cold shower, then finding the hot water heater just needed to be reset
Wait wait wait—ten thousand what? Are you talking about the podcast? Because if you're telling me what I think you're telling me, I'm gonna literally lose my mind right now.
Oh my god, okay—okay this is huge! This is like, this is actually huge! When you started weren't you hoping for like, what, a hundred people? [Gasp] Dude, ten THOUSAND humans chose to subscribe!
No no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you downplay everything. This isn't just a number, this is like... you built something people actually want, y'know?
Weird how? Like imposter syndrome weird or like—wait, are you freaking out? Because honestly I'd be freaking out. That's so many people listening to your voice.
I'm sorry—quit? Did you just— [Laugh] okay that's the most you thing I've ever heard. You hit a milestone and your brain goes straight to "time to bail."
Um, hello? Nobody knows what they're doing! That's like—that's literally the whole point. You think Joe Rogan knew what he was doing? Actually wait, bad example, but you know what I mean.
Hold on—you stress about fonts? In the show notes? Babe, I guarantee you like, maybe three people have ever even opened those. [Chuckle] You're such a perfectionist, I can't.
See, there's that humor! That's—that's exactly why people love your show, right? You're like, you're real. Not trying to be all polished and fake and whatever.
Your mom also thinks podcasts are "those computer radio things," so maybe—I mean, I love her, but maybe she's not exactly your target demographic here?
Okay but like—ten thousand people aren't stupid, y'know? They chose you. They literally clicked subscribe because something about what you're doing... it works. That's not a trick, that's just—that's you being good at something. [Sigh] Let yourself have this win, please?
Wait, what? I didn't—oh god, are you talking about the thing I said yesterday? That wasn't me trying to spoil it, I literally thought you'd finished the season already.
No, you said you were watching it! You said—okay okay, you said you started it like two weeks ago, so I just assumed... [sigh] I mean, who takes two weeks to watch eight episodes?
That's—come on, that's not fair. I have a job too. And honestly, you're kinda always talking about shows you're "totally gonna watch" and then never do, so how was I supposed to know this was different?
Right, but I didn't—look, I'm sorry it got spoiled, okay? But you're acting like I did this to be mean or something. It was literally just me being excited about the twist and wanting to talk about it with someone.
Oh, so now you're gonna be—fine. [frustrated laugh] Be sarcastic. But y'know what? Maybe if you actually finished shows when they came out instead of taking forever, this wouldn't happen.
And everyone else managed to—okay, that sounded worse than I meant. But seriously, the entire internet is talking about it. I've been dodging spoilers for you for days, and then I slip up once...
Because I thought you knew! God, I was being careful literally everywhere else—Twitter, work, with my roommate—and then with you, I just... I dunno, I relaxed because I figured we were safe to actually discuss it.
Yeah, I get that now. And I am—I am sorry it happened. [scoff] But you could also maybe cut me some slack here? Like, it was an honest mistake, not some deliberate betrayal.
Okay but—that's what I mean. You're being kinda harsh about this. I didn't mean to, and yeah yeah, impact over intent or whatever, but... I dunno, feels like you care more about your show than the fact that I feel terrible about this.
Do I—wow. Yeah, actually, I do. But apparently that doesn't matter because I committed the unforgivable sin of accidentally discussing a TV show. Y'know what? Fine. Be mad. I'm gonna go.
Wait wait wait—you WON? The whole—the whole competition? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna do amazing but like, this is huge! What did you make?
Lemon lav—okay that sounds absolutely incredible. Like, honestly? I'm not even surprised because remember that practice one you made last week? I literally [Gasp] ate half of it by myself.
No no no, but it still tasted like—I mean, who cares about structure when it tastes that good, right? So wait, what happens now? Is there like a prize or something?
FIVE HUNDRED—sorry, I just—wow. And a mixer? Those things are like, what, another three hundred? That's basically rent money! Are you gonna celebrate or...?
Just baking? Um, excuse me? You literally just beat—how many people were there? Like twenty? Thirty? This is not a "just" situation, this is a big [Laugh] freaking deal!
FORTY—okay now you're just being ridiculous. Forty-two people and you won? That's like, that's actually insane. You gotta let yourself be proud of this, y'know?
Oh... oh wait, is that—that's her recipe? The one you were telling me about? From when you were little? That makes it even more special, doesn't it?
Oh babe... she—I mean, in a way she kinda did? Through you? Like you're keeping her memory alive with every cake you make. That's really beautiful actually.
Transcendent! That's like—that's basically fancy judge speak for "this cake changed my life," right? [Chuckle] I'm telling everyone about this. My friend, the transcendent baker.
Too late, it's already a thing! I'm gonna—actually, we're gonna go out tonight, okay? My treat. You can sit there all modest if you want but we're definitely celebrating.
Comments? What—oh. Oh no. Is this about the thing I said at dinner? Because I was just joking around, you know? I didn't mean anything by it, honestly.
That's not—okay, maybe I've made a few jokes but like, I make jokes about everything, right? That's just how I am. I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. [nervous laugh] I mean, I should've noticed, shouldn't I?
Oh god, I did say that. I—wait wait wait, but I was being sarcastic! You know I don't actually think that. I was just—everyone makes those jokes about government jobs, I didn't think—
No no no, that's not what I meant. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I know those comments were stupid. Really stupid. I guess I was kinda... I dunno, maybe jealous? Of your benefits and stability and—that's not an excuse though.
Yeah, I mean—my job is such a mess right now and yours seems so... together? And instead of being happy for you I was being a jerk about it. Which is literally the worst way to handle it, I know.
You're right. You're completely right. I should've—god, I should've just been honest instead of making those dumb passive-aggressive comments. I think I was trying to make myself feel better but obviously that's [sigh] that's so messed up. I'm really, really sorry.
I know you did! That's what makes it worse—like, you studied for that exam for months, and you've been working your way up, and I just... minimized all of that. With stupid jokes that weren't even funny.
They were terrible. Honestly, they were mean and I—I hate that I made you feel bad about something you should be proud of. Because you should be proud. Your job is important and you're really good at it.
No, I know—I mean, I see how passionate you are when you talk about your projects. When you're not around me being an idiot about it. [quieter] I'm gonna stop with the comments, I promise. Like, completely done. No more jokes about it.
You deserve that. You deserve so much better than how I've been acting. And I—I wanna be better. I will be better. Your friendship means everything to me and I've been such a crappy friend lately. Can we—can we maybe start over with this?
I didn't—okay, wait wait wait, that's not exactly what happened. You asked me what I thought and I—I mean, what was I supposed to say? "Yeah, your new boyfriend seems like a total jerk"?
Oh come on, that's—you're seriously telling me you would've been fine with that? You were so happy, like literally glowing, and I just... [sigh] I didn't wanna be the one to ruin that for you.
I wasn't pretending, I was—okay okay, maybe I was being overly positive about some stuff, but it's not like I was completely making things up. I was trying to be supportive, y'know?
That's not—ugh, you're making it sound so black and white. Look, I get that you're pissed, I do, but honestly? You kinda put me in an impossible position here.
No, you asked for validation. There's a difference. Every time I even hinted at something negative, you'd get all defensive and—[frustrated laugh] whatever, apparently I'm the bad guy for trying to protect your feelings.
What? No—that's not what I was trying to do at all. How does me not trashing your boyfriend make you look stupid? That doesn't even make sense.
Okay but that's—that's on Alex for being fake, not on me for not wanting to burst your bubble. And honestly? I'm a little disappointed that you think I'd deliberately let you get hurt like that.
By trying not to hurt you? That's—[scoff] fine fine, I messed up, but at least my intentions were good. You're acting like I wanted this to happen.
They don't—wow, okay. So basically nothing I say matters because you've already decided I'm the villain here. Cool. Really mature way to handle this.
I'm not—I'm not turning anything around, I'm just... y'know what? I'm sorry I didn't tell you Alex sucked. I'm sorry I tried to be a supportive friend. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like I did this malicious thing when we both know that's not what happened.
SCENARIO: waiting for their phone to charge enough to turn on
[cheerfully] Sweetie, I've reorganized your entire apartment while you were at work! [getting faster] I color-coded your closet, meal-prepped for two weeks, and [giggling] even scheduled your dentist appointment for tomorrow at nine.
[wounded] But darling, I was just trying to help! [quivering] The place was such a mess, and you never answer my calls anymore. [Soft sob] I worry about you constantly since you moved out.
[frantically] Fifteen times isn't that much when you think about it! [defensive] Your father thinks I'm being perfectly reasonable. [pleading whisper] Can't a mother just check if her baby ate breakfast and took vitamins?
[accusingly] Well, someone has to remember when you were sweet! [bitter laugh] Now you act like I'm some kind of burden. [dramatically] I gave up everything for you, my entire career, my whole identity!
[sarcastically] Oh, wonderful advice from someone who can't even fold fitted sheets properly! [getting louder] You still need me, whether you admit it or not. [Nervous giggle] Who else would notice you're dating that terrible person?
[hysterically] A break? From your own mother? [Choking sob] This is exactly what happened with cousin Janet and look how that turned out! [whimpering] She died alone, probably calling for her ungrateful children!
[desperately] But what if there's an emergency and I can't reach you immediately? [rapid words] What if you choke on dinner, or slip in the shower, or [Gasp] get kidnapped by internet people?
[offended whisper] You think I'm crazy now? [building volume] First I'm a stalker, now I need therapy? [Bitter chuckle] Maybe I should just pretend you don't exist like those modern parents do!
[quietly] You and your father have been discussing me behind my back? [hurt] I suppose everyone thinks poor Mom is just pathetic now. [Shaky breath] Fine, maybe I have been a tiny bit overwhelming.
[reluctantly] I suppose calling three times daily would be excessive too? [Nervous laugh] The watercolor class does meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. [thoughtfully] Margaret from book club mentioned she's taking it; maybe I could actually join her.
[professionally] Well, the contribution limits depend on several factors. [clearly] For 2024, the basic 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000, not $6,500. [helpfully] However, if you're talking about an IRA, [more slowly] that would be $7,000 for most people.
[patiently] That's alright, we can look that up differently. [reassuring tone] Just to clarify though, are you asking about your employer's 401(k) plan, [slightly slower] or do you have an Individual Retirement Account with us?
[understanding] Ah, so you're referring to your workplace 401(k) plan. [informatively] The $23,000 limit I mentioned is correct for that. [encouragingly] Plus, if you're 50 or older, [emphasizing] you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution.
[confirmingly] Exactly right—$30,500 total for 2024! [cheerfully] That's the maximum you can contribute from your salary. [clarifying] Your employer's matching contributions don't count toward that limit, [more enthusiastically] so that 6% match is extra money on top.
[helpfully] Contributing $400 monthly would give you $4,800 annually, which is a great start! [explaining] Most employers deduct per paycheck though. [practically] If you're paid bi-weekly, [calculating] that would be about $185 per paycheck to reach your $400 monthly goal.
[clarifying gently] Bi-weekly means every two weeks, so 26 paychecks per year. [more precisely] Semi-monthly would be twice a month, or 24 paychecks. [reassuringly] I can check your pay frequency, [pause] but you'd need to verify that employee ID with your HR department first.
[approvingly] Perfect math—exactly $200 per paycheck! [encouragingly] That's a solid contribution amount that won't overwhelm your budget. [informatively] Remember, this reduces your taxable income too, [more enthusiastically] so your actual take-home pay won't decrease by the full $200.
[explaining clearly] Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, meaning they lower your taxable income. [illustrating] If you're in the 22% tax bracket, a $200 contribution might only reduce your take-home by about $156. [reassuringly] So yes, [confidently] the impact is less than the actual contribution amount.
[sympathetically] Yes, $1,270.83 per paycheck to be exact—that's quite substantial! [encouragingly] Most people work up to higher contributions gradually over time. [practically] As you get raises or pay off debts, [suggesting gently] you can increase your percentage slowly.
[laughing warmly] The form names can be confusing! [helpfully] You'll typically need to log into your employer's benefits portal or contact HR directly. [reassuringly] They'll have the correct change form, [concluding] and most companies now let you adjust contributions online—no paper forms needed!
[apologetically] I understand you're upset about the advertised item, sir. [quickly] Unfortunately, our—our weekly special on the flat-screen TVs sold out this morning. [sighs] We had limited quantities, and they went faster than anticipated.
[calmly] You're absolutely right to be frustrated, and I... I genuinely apologize for the inconvenience. [more firmly] We can offer you a rain check at the sale price, or [quickly] perhaps look at comparable models with a discount.
[sympathetically] Forty-five minutes—that's quite a drive, and I can see why you'd be upset. [briskly] Let me check with our district inventory system. Sometimes [hopefully] we can transfer items from nearby stores within twenty-four hours.
[defensively] Sir, I assure you there's no bait-and-switch here. [more reassuringly] We genuinely ran out due to unexpected demand. [quickly] I'm pulling up our inventory now—just, um, give me one moment please.
[conceding] You make a valid point about the advertising. [briskly] Good news though—our Riverside location has three units left. [more enthusiastically] I can reserve one right now and, given your drive today, offer an additional ten percent off.
[confidently] Riverside is twenty minutes east, and yes, once I complete this reservation, it's guaranteed yours. [rapidly] I'll need your name and phone number, and they'll hold it for forty-eight hours. [warmly] Would that work for you?
[professionally] Perfect, Mr. Morrison, I'm entering that now. [quickly] The confirmation number is—is TV4521, and [helpfully] I'll also email you directions to Riverside with the manager's name who'll be expecting you.
[reassuringly] Absolutely no hassle—I'm noting everything in our system right now. [more firmly] Jessica, their manager, will have all the details, and [briskly] I'm also printing you a copy of this agreement with my signature.
[understanding] No apology necessary—I'd be frustrated too in your position. [warmly] These things shouldn't happen, and we're, um, actually reviewing our inventory forecasting because of situations like this. [quickly] Here's your paperwork.
[pleased] That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Morrison. [enthusiastically] Don't forget to ask Jessica about our loyalty program—with purchases like this, you'll earn [briskly] significant points toward future discounts.
[Disappointed] My boss literally told me I was, uh, "too ambitious" for wanting a promotion after three years. [Tsk] Can you believe that?
[Happy] [Laugh] You know what? Walking out of there was the most liberating thing I've done in—god, probably ever!
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, working sixty hours a week for a "pizza party" reward was totally worth it. [Groan]
[Angry] They promoted his nephew over me—his nephew who doesn't even know how to use Excel! [Shout] It's ridiculous!
[Whisper] Between you and me, I found out they were gonna lay off half our department anyway. [Fast] So I got out first.
[Sad] I just couldn't keep pretending everything was fine when I'd literally cry in my car every morning, you know? [Sigh]
[Slow] The commute was, um, slowly destroying my soul—two hours each way, every single day. [Disappointed]
[Fast] [Happy] I got this amazing offer and they wanted me to start immediately so I just—boom, two weeks notice, done!
[Chuckle] My coworker microwaved fish for the hundredth time and I thought, "That's it, I'm done." [Sarcastic] Best decision ever.
[Angry] [Fast] They kept piling on responsibilities without—I mean, zero extra pay, zero recognition, just more and more work!
[Disappointed] Honestly? The company values were just, like, words on a poster that nobody actually—they didn't mean anything. [Tsk]
[Slow] [Sad] When my dad got sick, they wouldn't give me time off to—to be with him, so...
[Whisper] I kinda discovered they were doing some pretty shady stuff with the books. [Fast] Had to get out before it blew up.
[Happy] Life's too short to be miserable eight hours a day, right? [Laugh] I'm gonna travel instead!
[Sarcastic] [Groan] Apparently suggesting improvements made me "not a team player"—sorry for trying to help, I guess?
[Shout] Five years without a single raise! [Angry] Not even cost of living adjustments—nothing!
[Slow] I realized I was becoming someone I didn't like—bitter, exhausted, just... not myself anymore. [Sigh]
[Fast] [Disappointed] The new management came in and basically gutted everything that made the place special, y'know?
[Chuckle] Would you believe I quit because of the coffee? [Happy] Nah, but seriously, that was definitely the last straw.
[Sad] [Whisper] I had a panic attack in the bathroom and thought—I can't, I just can't do this anymore.
SCENARIO: Casually describing a cough they've had, then counting the days, then realizing it's been weeks, ending in persistent symptom anxiety
I—okay, hold on. What was I supposed to do? Start a fight with your boss in the middle of the meeting? That's not—that wouldn't have helped anything.
Like what? Seriously, like what? "Hey, stop being mean to my friend"? [Scoff] That would've made you look worse, not better. I was trying to—I dunno, keep things from escalating.
That's not—I wasn't doing nothing. I was literally biting my tongue so I wouldn't say something that would get us both in trouble. You think I liked sitting there? You think that was fun for me?
Oh, come on. That's—that's bullshit and you know it. I was trying to be strategic about it, okay? Sometimes the smart move is to not—look, if I'd jumped in, it would've become this whole thing. [Frustrated laugh] And then we'd both be screwed.
Yes, strategic! I mean—Jesus, you're acting like I threw you under the bus or something. I texted you right after, didn't I? I was gonna talk to him separately, when things cooled down.
What damage? He was being a dick, everyone could see that. Nobody thought less of you because—okay okay, I get that you're hurt, but honestly? You're kinda being unfair here.
And I—look, I'm sorry you felt alone in there, I am. But you didn't exactly give me a heads up that you were gonna push back on the project timeline either, so I was just as blindsided as everyone else.
That's not what I'm—[groan] stop twisting everything I say. I'm just saying there's context here that you're ignoring. We're supposed to be a team, but you went rogue and then expected me to what, read your mind?
I do have your back! But having your back doesn't mean—it doesn't mean I'm gonna commit career suicide every time someone's mean to you. That's not—I mean, is that really what you want from me?
No, don't—don't do that. Don't just shut down because I'm not giving you the perfect apology you want. I'm trying to—look, I could've handled it better, okay? But you could also try to understand why I didn't.
SCENARIO: waiting for their turn at the DMV
[nervously] Thanks for coming, Sarah. I wasn't sure you'd show up. [clearing throat] I know twenty years is... [trailing off] well, it's a lifetime, especially when it's most of yours.
[defensive] That's not fair—I never forgot about you. [softer] Your mother made it clear I wasn't welcome, and [long exhale] maybe I was too proud or too stupid to fight harder.
[pained whisper] Every single one haunts me. [stronger] I sent cards, gifts—your mother returned them all unopened. [cracking voice] I tried, Sarah, but I should've tried harder, I know that now.
[urgently] I did come! [frustrated groan] Three times I drove to your house, but I'd just sit in the car, paralyzed. [defeated] What could I say to make up for lost time?
[pleading tone] I was terrified you'd reject me, that you'd already forgotten who I was. [steadier] But I'm here now, trying. [hopeful] Can't we at least attempt to build something from this?
[surprised gasp] Married? [warmly] That's wonderful news, sweetheart—I mean, Sarah. [hesitant] I'd be honored to be there, in whatever capacity you'd have me, even just as a guest.
[eagerly] Yes, absolutely, whatever you need. [relieved laugh] Coffee, lunch, just a phone call—I'll take any chance you give me. [emotionally] I promise I won't waste this opportunity, not this time.
[solemnly] I understand completely. [deep breath] I've been seeing a therapist, actually, working through why I ran. [quietly determined] I'm not that same coward anymore, or at least I'm trying not to be.
[gently] I know, and I'm not asking for instant forgiveness. [thoughtful] But maybe we could exchange phone numbers? [hopefully] Start with texts, work our way up to actual conversations when you're ready?
[grateful whisper] Thank you, Sarah, this means everything. [choking up] I know I don't deserve this second chance, but [stronger] I swear I'll do whatever it takes to earn your trust back.
[nervously] Oh, hi! You must be Sarah. [voice getting higher] I've heard so much about you from Emma—she talks about her mom all the time. [rushed] I'm Jessica, I've been seeing Mark for a few months now.
[defensive] Actually, I teach Pilates. [quieter] But yes, I'm getting used to the schedule. Emma's such a sweet girl, [warmly] she makes it easy. We've been bonding over her art projects lately at home.
[apologetically] Of course, I didn't mean to overstep. [stammering] I just wanted to help when she asked. [more confidently] Mark thought it would be good for us to spend time together, building our relationship naturally.
[uncomfortable whisper] We're taking things slow with Emma. [steadier] She seems to be adjusting well, actually. [hesitant] Maybe we could all work together to make this transition easier? For her sake, I mean.
[hurt] I'm not trying to replace you. [pleading] Nobody could ever do that. [softer] I just want Emma to feel comfortable when she's with us. [genuine] You've raised an amazing daughter—that's obvious to everyone.
[relieved exhale] I appreciate you saying that. [carefully] I know this must be incredibly hard for you. [sympathetic] If it helps, I grew up with divorced parents too—I understand how complicated it gets.
Oh god, okay—look, I know you're mad about the party thing, but can we just—I mean, I told you weeks ago that wasn't gonna work for me.
That's not—that's literally not true. We hung out last week! We went to that movie, we got coffee, we did plenty of stuff.
Because that's what I'm comfortable with! [Sigh] Like, I don't get why that's suddenly this huge problem when you've known this about me forever.
Missing—okay okay, so now I'm ruining your life? That's what you're saying? Because I can't just magically be okay with crowds and strangers and all that noise?
But it's what you meant, right? I mean, come on. You're basically telling me I'm a bad friend because I have anxiety, which—honestly, that's kinda messed up.
I do try! I try all the [frustrated laugh] time! You just don't see it because trying for me doesn't look like—like just showing up to some random house party with fifty people I don't know.
Your—wait, that's what this is about? That's not fair, you said you understood. You literally said "it's fine, don't worry about it" and now you're throwing it in my face?
Well that's—I mean, what am I supposed to do with that? I can't go back and un-miss it. And honestly, I would've just had a panic attack anyway, so.
Oh, so now you're my therapist? Look look, I get that you're hurt, okay? I do. But you're acting like I'm choosing this, like I wake up and decide "hey, let's disappoint everyone today."
Wow. Okay. Fine fine, if that's really what you think of me, then I dunno why we're even—[scoff] I guess I'm sorry for having a mental illness that inconveniences you.
What? No, I—I thought we were good. We talked it out, didn't we? I mean, you said you understood where I was coming from and I said I got your point, so...
Okay okay, hold on—that's not the same thing at all. Today was completely different. I wasn't excluding you, I just—Mike asked me a question and I answered it. [scoff] That's literally just having a conversation.
You're—come on, you're being kinda unfair here. I can't just not talk to people when you're around. That's not how friendships work, y'know?
Then what—what is it about? Because honestly, I thought we resolved this. I apologized for making you feel left out at the party, and now you're mad that I'm... what, existing normally? [frustrated laugh] I dunno what you want from me.
I am—look look, I am trying, okay? But you're acting like I'm supposed to be perfect immediately. Like, these are habits I've had for years and I'm—I'm working on it, but you gotta give me more than two days.
And I didn't—I didn't even know it bothered you until Monday! You never said anything before, so how was I supposed to know? I'm not a mind reader.
That's—[sigh] okay, that's dramatic. I never made you invisible. Sometimes I get excited about stuff and I talk over people, yeah, but that's not—it's not personal. I do it to everyone, ask literally anyone.
No! No, that's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to explain that it's not about you specifically, it's just something I gotta work on in general.
Wow. Okay. So you're just gonna be like this then? Because I'm—I'm really trying here, but you're not giving me anything. You want me to grovel? Is that it?
I do care! But I also—I dunno, I also think you're holding me to this impossible standard where one conversation means I'm suddenly gonna be a completely different person. And that's not—[quieter] that's not really fair either, y'know?
SCENARIO: noticing a typo after sending an important email
Oh god, okay—I know what this is about. I'm sorry about yesterday, I really am. I shouldn't have just shown up at your work like that, I wasn't thinking and I—
Right, yeah, you're—you're totally right. I keep doing this thing where I just... I dunno, I get excited about something and I wanna share it with you immediately and I don't think about whether it's appropriate timing or—[nervous laugh] wow, I'm really bad at this, aren't I?
That was—okay that was completely out of line. Like, completely. It was just sitting open on your coffee table and I glanced at it without thinking but that's not—that's not an excuse, I know. I shouldn't have even looked.
Wait wait wait, I didn't tell him you were in therapy! I just mentioned that you had an appointment on Thursday so you couldn't come to drinks, and he—he figured it out himself, but yeah, I see how that's still... [groan] I'm literally the worst friend ever.
No no no, please don't—I mean, I get it. I do. I keep crossing these lines and it's not okay. I just, I've never been good with the whole boundaries thing? Like growing up, my family was all up in each other's business constantly and I know that's not normal but—
You're right. You're absolutely right, it's not. I'm making excuses when I should just be... apologizing. And changing. Um, mostly the changing part, I guess, since apologizing clearly isn't enough anymore.
I wanna—I wanna fix this. I really do. You're like, one of my best friends and I'm realizing that I've been treating you kinda terribly? Not on purpose but that doesn't matter because the result is the same and you're hurt and I—[sigh] just tell me what you need from me.
Yes. Absolutely. I can—I can do that. I will do that. Um, should I like, text before coming over from now on? Wait, obviously yes, that's a normal thing people do. And I won't touch your stuff or share your personal info or—basically I'll try to act like a normal human being with boundaries.
I know I've said this before but I really am sorry. Like, genuinely deeply sorry. You've been so patient with me and I just kept... kept pushing and pushing without realizing how much it was affecting you.
They will. They will change, I promise. And not like—not like my usual promises where I forget after a week. I'm gonna actually work on this. Maybe even talk to my therapist about it? Because you're right, this is my problem to fix, not yours to deal with.
