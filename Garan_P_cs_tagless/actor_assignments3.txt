Character 1: You forgot again.

201 Character 2: What? No, I—wait, what did I forget? Oh god, was it the—oh NO. The allergy thing. The peanut allergy thing, I totally forgot when I brought those cookies to your sister's party, didn't I?

Character 1: I've told you a hundred times.

202 Character 2: I know, I know, you have, and I just—my brain is like swiss cheese lately, y'know? That's not an excuse, I'm not making excuses, I'm just... [groan] I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did it again.

Character 1: She had to use her EpiPen.

203 Character 2: Oh my god. Oh my god, is she okay? Wait wait wait—she had to actually use it? I thought—I mean, I didn't think—god, I'm such an idiot. Is she at the hospital? Should I—can I do something?

Character 1: She's fine. No thanks to you.

204 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'll pay for the EpiPen replacement, obviously. And the hospital bills if there are any. I just... I honestly don't know what's wrong with me. [nervous laugh] Like, you literally tell me every single time and I still somehow manage to mess it up.

Character 1: Every. Single. Time.

205 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, you do. And I—I write it down sometimes, but then I forget to check what I wrote, or I leave the list at home, or I just... I dunno, I get distracted? That sounds so stupid when I say it out loud.

Character 1: It could've been really bad.

206 Character 2: I know it could've. That's the—that's the worst part, right? Like, this isn't forgetting your birthday or something. This is serious, life-threatening stuff and I just... treated it like it was nothing. No no no, not like it was nothing, but like—ugh, I'm not explaining this right.

Character 1: Then explain it better.

207 Character 2: I guess I just—okay, so in my head, I know it's important. Super important. But then I'm at the store and I see these amazing cookies and I'm thinking "oh she'll love these" and somehow the allergy thing just... disappears? [sigh] Even though you've told me literally a hundred times.

Character 1: It's not that hard to remember.

208 Character 2: No, it's not. It's really, really not, and that's—that's what makes me feel even worse about it, honestly. Like, one thing. You ask me to remember one thing and I can't even... I keep failing you. And her. I'm so sorry.

Character 1: I don't know if I can keep doing this.

209 Character 2: Wait, please—don't say that. I'm gonna—I'm gonna set reminders on my phone. Like, multiple reminders. And I'll put a note in my wallet, and my car, and—basically everywhere. I know I've probably said this before but this time I really—I can't lose you over this. I can't.

Character 1: You said you'd try harder last time too.

210 Character 2: I know. I know I did. But seeing her have to use that EpiPen because of me? That's—I can't get that image out of my head. I swear to you, I will never, NEVER bring anything with peanuts near her again. Or tree nuts. Or any nuts. Just... please give me one more chance?

Script: 8cff7528_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You took Jake's side.

211 Character 2: I—okay, yeah, I did, but honestly? I thought he had a point. Like, I'm sorry, but I genuinely thought you were being kinda unreasonable about the whole thing.

Character 1: Unreasonable. Right.

212 Character 2: Don't do that. Don't just—look, I wasn't trying to gang up on you or whatever you're thinking. I just... when he explained his perspective, it made sense to me. [Sigh] That doesn't mean I don't care about your feelings.

Character 1: You're supposed to be my friend.

213 Character 2: I am your friend! But that doesn't mean I'm gonna automatically agree with everything you do. That's not—friends can disagree, y'know? I'm allowed to have my own opinion about stuff.

Character 1: In private, maybe.

214 Character 2: What, so I'm supposed to just sit there and nod along even when I think you're wrong? Come on. That's not fair and you know it. I wasn't being malicious, I was being honest.

Character 1: You embarrassed me. In front of everyone.

215 Character 2: That wasn't—[frustrated laugh]—okay, I get that it felt that way, but I wasn't trying to embarrass you. I was literally just saying what I thought. And honestly? Maybe you needed to hear it from someone who actually cares about you.

Character 1: How considerate of you.

216 Character 2: See, this is what I mean. You're being—you're acting like I betrayed you or something when all I did was disagree. Like, I'm sorry it hurt your feelings, okay? But I'm not gonna apologize for having an opinion.

Character 1: It's not about the opinion.

217 Character 2: Then what—what is it about? Because from where I'm standing, it seems like you're mad that I didn't just blindly take your side, which is kinda... I dunno, it's kinda messed up actually.

Character 1: It's about loyalty.

218 Character 2: Loyalty doesn't mean—ugh, loyalty doesn't mean never calling you out when you're wrong. [Scoff] If anything, a real friend tells you the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. Especially then.

Character 1: You could've talked to me first. Privately.

219 Character 2: I—okay, okay, maybe. Maybe I should've. But it came up in the moment and I just... I said what I thought. And honestly? I still think Jake was right about most of it.

Character 1: Good to know where we stand.

220 Character 2: No, don't—don't do that. We're still friends, alright? Just because I disagree with you on one thing doesn't mean I'm choosing him over you or whatever narrative you're building in your head. I just... I thought you were wrong this time. That's it.

Script: 50fdd5ab_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You knew exactly what Marcus was like.

221 Character 2: Okay, so—wait wait wait, before you get mad, just let me explain. I didn't think he was gonna be that bad, I swear. Like, when I met him at Katie's thing, he seemed totally normal.

Character 1: He brought his mother.

222 Character 2: I know! I know, that's—[nervous laugh]—that's completely insane. But like, how was I supposed to know he'd do that? He never mentioned being, y'know, that attached to her.

Character 1: She ordered for him.

223 Character 2: Oh god, she did? He didn't—okay that's worse than I thought. I'm so, so sorry. Honestly, I had no idea he was gonna—I mean, who even does that?

Character 1: You set me up with him on purpose. Don't lie.

224 Character 2: No no no, I didn't—okay, fine. [sigh] I maybe kinda knew he was a little quirky? But I thought quirky could be good! You're always saying you want someone different, and I just—I dunno, I thought maybe different would work.

Character 1: Quirky? He asked the waiter if the chicken had a name.

225 Character 2: He what? Oh my god, I'm—I'm literally dying inside right now. That's not quirky, that's—yeah, that's something else entirely. I really really messed up here.

Character 1: You think?

226 Character 2: I wasn't trying to—look, Katie said he was just shy! And you know how you sometimes intimidate guys, so I thought maybe someone more, um, gentle would be—actually never mind, that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.

Character 1: So you thought I needed someone pathetic.

227 Character 2: No! That's not—that's not what I meant at all. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? I just wanted you to be happy and I thought—I dunno what I thought. I'm an idiot, basically.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

228 Character 2: I wanna make it up to you, okay? Like, whatever you want—drinks are on me for the next month, or—or I'll never set you up again, which honestly might be the better option here.

Character 1: His mother asked me about my fertility.

229 Character 2: She WHAT? No no no, that's—okay I'm gonna need therapy just from hearing about this secondhand. I am so, so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I promise I'll screen people better—actually, y'know what? No more setups. Ever.

Character 1: That's probably for the best. You're buying drinks tonight.

230 Character 2: Yes! Absolutely, done. As many drinks as it takes to forget this ever happened. And I'm—I'm really sorry. I know I'm terrible at this matchmaking thing, but I just—I care about you, y'know? Even if I'm apparently the worst at showing it.

Script: 3a5ab2ef_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Third time this week.

231 Character 2: Oh god, I know—I know how this looks. I'm literally the worst friend right now, I get it. But Jake had this thing come up and I—wait, that's not even a good excuse, is it?

Character 1: It never is.

232 Character 2: No no no, you're right, you're totally right. I've been—I've been that person, haven't I? The one who just disappears when they get a boyfriend and I always said I'd never—[groan] I'm doing exactly what I hate.

Character 1: Glad you noticed.

233 Character 2: I didn't mean to blow you off, honestly. Time just kinda... gets away from me lately? Like I'll think it's Tuesday and suddenly it's Thursday and I've missed our coffee thing again and—that sounds so stupid when I say it out loud.

Character 1: Yeah. It does.

234 Character 2: I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. You've been nothing but supportive about Jake and I've been—I've basically been taking you for granted, haven't I? [nervous laugh] God, I suck.

Character 1: How many times have we had plans this month?

235 Character 2: Um... I dunno, maybe—actually wait, let me think. There was the movie night, and brunch, and—oh. Oh wow. That's... that's like six times? Seven? And I canceled every single—yeah, okay, I see it now.

Character 1: Eight times. But who's counting.

236 Character 2: Eight. Jesus. That's—I didn't realize it was that bad. I mean, I knew I'd been flaky but eight times? That's not flaky, that's just... that's being a terrible friend.

Character 1: I was there for you through the breakup with Tom. Remember?

237 Character 2: Of course I remember—you literally held my hair back when I was crying so hard I threw up. You brought me ice cream at 2 AM. You—[sigh] you've always been there and I just... dropped you the second something good happened to me.

Character 1: Pretty much, yeah.

238 Character 2: Can we—would you wanna maybe get dinner tomorrow? Just us, I promise. No Jake, no distractions, I'll literally turn my phone off. I know I know, I don't deserve it after being such a crap friend but I miss you. I miss us.

Character 1: You said that last week too.

239 Character 2: I did, didn't I? And then I—god, I bailed for that stupid concert. Look, what if you pick the place and the time and I just—I'll be there. Early, even. I'll be there stupidly early with your favorite coffee as an apology bribe.

Character 1: I don't want apology coffee. I just want my friend back.

240 Character 2: Yeah. Yeah, me too. I want—I wanna be that friend again, y'know? The one you could actually count on. I got so caught up in the new relationship butterflies that I forgot what actually matters and that's... that's on me. Completely on me.

Script: c8ef5636_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about your constant advice.

241 Character 2: Oh. Oh no, is this—wait, are you upset with me? Because I feel like you've been kinda distant lately and I wasn't sure if I did something or—

Character 1: Every conversation. Every single one.

242 Character 2: I don't—what do you mean? [nervous laugh] I mean, I know I talk a lot but I'm not really following what you're getting at here.

Character 1: You always tell me what I should do. Always.

243 Character 2: Wait wait wait, that's not—okay maybe I do sometimes offer suggestions but it's only because I care! Like, I see you struggling with stuff and I just wanna help, y'know?

Character 1: I never asked for your help.

244 Character 2: But you—you vent to me about things! And I thought that meant—I mean, aren't friends supposed to help each other? I'm honestly confused because I thought that's what we do.

Character 1: Sometimes people just need to be heard.

245 Character 2: Oh. Oh god. [groan] You're right. You're totally right. I just—I always jump straight into fix-it mode, don't I? Like you can't even finish a sentence without me being all "you should do this" or "have you tried that."

Character 1: Yesterday. About my job. You gave me a whole career plan.

246 Character 2: I know, I know. That was—yeah, that was way too much. You were literally just telling me about your bad day and I turned it into this whole thing about updating your resume and—god, I'm that friend, aren't I? The one who can't just shut up and listen.

Character 1: It's exhausting.

247 Character 2: I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry. I didn't realize I was doing it that much—actually no, that's a lie. Part of me kinda knew but I kept telling myself I was being helpful.

Character 1: You're not my life coach. You're supposed to be my friend.

248 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right and I—[sigh] I think maybe I do it because giving advice makes me feel useful? Like if I can't fix my own mess of a life, at least I can pretend to have answers for yours. Which is super messed up, I know.

Character 1: I just want you to listen sometimes. That's all.

249 Character 2: I can do that. I mean, I'm gonna try really hard to do that. Would it help if—actually, no, see? There I go again trying to solve it. Just... tell me when I'm doing it, okay? Call me out.

Character 1: Every time?

250 Character 2: Every single time. I mean it. I don't wanna lose you as a friend over my big mouth. You matter more to me than being right or—or whatever need I'm filling by being everyone's unwanted therapist.

251 SCENARIO: waiting for the dryer to finish

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, twenty minutes? Thirty? I feel like it's been— it's been forever, but it's probably, uh, probably not even close to done yet.

[slightly impatient]

These things always take, what, like an hour? Maybe more? I should've, um, I should've checked the timer when I started it, but I was just— I was in a rush to get it going and now I'm just, uh, just standing here like an idiot.

[conversational]

I mean, I could go do something else, right? Like, I don't have to just— just hover around the laundry room like some kind of, um, some kind of dryer stalker. [laugh] That's weird. That's a weird thing to say.

[second-guessing]

But what if it's almost done and I miss it? Then my clothes are just gonna sit there getting all wrinkled and— and I hate ironing. I really, really hate ironing.

[listening intently]

Wait, is it— is it slowing down? It sounds different. Or maybe I'm just, uh, maybe I'm just imagining things because I want it to be done.

[resigned]

You know what, I'm just gonna— I'm gonna go make some coffee and check back in like fifteen minutes. Yeah. That's, um, that's the adult thing to do here.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: e55326aa | Role: Character 1 (A)

252 Character 1: [sniffling] I can't believe Mom kept all our kindergarten drawings. [voice breaking] Look at this one—you drew me as a potato with stick legs. [shaky laugh] I remember being so mad, but now I'd frame it forever.

Character 2: [through tears] Oh God, and here's the diary where I wrote about hating you for three pages. [hiccupping] "Sarah is the WORST sister because she ate my Halloween candy." [voice cracking] I was so dramatic about those stupid Reese's cups.

253 Character 1: [wailing] Remember when we carved our initials under this windowsill? [quieter] We thought we were being so rebellious. [sobbing harder] Dad knew the whole time but never said anything until last week when he mentioned it casually.

Character 2: [gasping] The glow-in-the-dark stars! [more desperately] We can't take them down, they've been up there for fifteen years! [whimpering] You made me count them every night when I couldn't sleep after watching that scary movie.

254 Character 1: [trembling whisper] This closet still smells like your strawberry body spray from middle school. [louder, crying] You practically fumigated our room with it every morning. [choking up] Now I'll probably buy a bottle just to remember this place.

Character 2: [angry sobbing] Why did they have to sell the house NOW? [softer] Couldn't they wait until we were emotionally prepared—like never? [bitter laugh] Twenty-three years in this room and we get two boxes to pack our entire childhood.

255 Character 1: [barely audible] Found the friendship bracelet you made me in fourth grade. [voice rising hysterically] The one I swore I lost at summer camp! [gulping air] It was wedged behind my bed frame this whole time, perfectly preserved.

Character 2: [monotone] I'm keeping this carpet stain from when I spilled nail polish. [suddenly yelling] I'll cut it out if I have to! [whimpering] It's the pink blob that started our biggest fight and ended with us laughing.

256 Character 1: [rapid, panicking] What about the height marks on the doorframe? [slower] Every birthday, every first day of school. [long wail] The new family will just paint over our entire growth history like we never even existed here.

Character 2: [exhausted whisper] Mom says they're turning this into a home gym. [building rage] A HOME GYM, Sarah! [defeated sob] Where we had sleepovers and told secrets and practiced kissing on our pillows—it'll be some stranger's treadmill room.

257 Character 1: [nostalgic crying] Remember our secret knock? [demonstrating rhythm] Tap-tap-pause-tap-tap-tap. [voice faltering] We haven't used it in years but my hand still remembers exactly how hard to hit the door to make it echo right.

Character 2: [shrieking] I just found the list of boys we liked in seventh grade! [quieter giggling] Marcus Thompson is number one with hearts everywhere. [groaning] He's married with twins now and I still can't look him in the eye.

258 Character 1: [determined] We should take a piece of the wallpaper from behind the dresser. [more softly] The part where we measured ourselves lying down. [snorting] You always cheated by pointing your toes but I never called you out.

Character 2: [hollow voice] This afternoon sunlight through the window. [increasingly emotional] How it hits the wall at exactly four-thirty in summer. [weeping] No one else will know to sit right here in this spot when they need comfort.

259 Character 1: [accusingly upset] You're taking the music box, right? [gentler] The one Grandma gave us to share but you always kept on your nightstand? [pleading] Please take it—I can't bear thinking of it in donation somewhere.

Character 2: [fierce whisper] Of course I'm taking it. [loudly sobbing] And the broken ballerina inside that we superglued wrong so she spins backwards. [laughing through tears] She's been pirouetting in reverse for a decade like our own little rebel.

260 Character 1: [philosophical sadness] Maybe the walls absorbed all our fights and make-ups and midnight conversations. [hopeful] Maybe they'll whisper our stories to whoever sleeps here next. [breaking down] God, that's stupid, walls don't remember anything, do they?

Character 2: [firmly] They remember everything. [voice splintering] Every poster we hung, every song we blasted, every time we cried into our pillows. [desperate whisper] This room is more us than anything we could possibly pack in boxes.

261 Character 1: [defeated] I can't do the last corner, where we built the blanket fort. [trembling] Where you held me after my first heartbreak. [steadier] Let's just leave it exactly as it is—our final rebellion against growing up.

Character 2: [quiet acceptance] Okay, we'll leave it. [stronger] A tiny museum of who we were before life got complicated. [breaking completely] Come here, let's do our secret handshake one more time before this stops being our room forever.

Script: 89081496 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] So wait, this draw schedule thing... [hesitant] it says I need to submit form 287-B before getting the first $45,000? [increasingly frustrated] Nobody mentioned forms when I signed that massive contract at 1247 Oak Street last Tuesday.

262 Customer Support: Actually, Mr. Henderson, that's standard procedure. The 287-B is just your foundation inspection certificate, and [more clearly] once we verify completion of phase one—roughly 20% of your $225,000 loan—we release those funds.

Character 1: [skeptical] Twenty percent for just the foundation? [groans] My contractor, uh, Dave from BuildRight LLC, he's saying he needs $62,000 upfront. [worried] How am I supposed to pay him if you're only releasing forty-five?

263 Customer Support: Well, typically contractors understand our draw schedule system. According to your file, account number JX-4429-B, you have five scheduled draws. The difference between what Dave needs and what we release—that's where your down payment comes in.

Character 1: [exasperated] My down payment already went to the land purchase! [sighs heavily] Look, page seventeen of this schedule mentions something about, um... [reading slowly] "contingency reserves of 10%"—what even is that?

264 Customer Support: [calmly] Those reserves, that's $22,500 set aside for unexpected costs. Think of it as your safety net! You can't touch it unless you submit variance form VF-19 with documented overages.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, more forms. [muttering] VF-19, 287-B... [louder and frustrated] And apparently there's also an inspection at each draw? My project at 3864 Willow Lane can't wait for five separate inspector visits!

265 Customer Support: I understand the frustration, but these inspections protect you. Inspector badge number 7792, Jim Wallace, he's assigned to your region. [reassuringly] Usually he can complete inspections within 48 to 72 hours of request.

Character 1: [desperately] Forty-eight to seventy-two hours each time? [calculating anxiously] That's potentially fifteen days of just waiting! [pleading] Can't we just, I don't know, combine draws two and three since they're both for framing?

266 Customer Support: Unfortunately, our guidelines under regulation CC-2019.3 don't allow combined draws. However, if your contractor completes work faster than expected, we can sometimes expedite with rush code R-11, though that's a $250 fee per occurrence.

Script: c4132787 | Role: Customer Support

267 Customer Support: Hey, so... I know we were supposed to be there at nine this morning. The truck broke down on the highway, and we're—we're still waiting for the tow. [more quietly] I'm really sorry about this.

Character 1: [exhausted] This is the third time, Mike. [pause] Third. Time. [getting louder] I took off work again, rearranged my entire schedule, and [groans] you're telling me the truck broke down?

268 Customer Support: [defensive] Look, I understand you're frustrated, I really do. We've had a rough week—two guys quit, equipment issues, and now this. Can we reschedule for tomorrow afternoon?

Character 1: [sarcastically] Tomorrow? Oh sure, let me just call my boss and explain why I need a fourth day off. [bitter laugh] "Sorry, the contractor who hasn't shown up three times might come tomorrow." [firmly] This is unacceptable.

269 Customer Support: Okay, okay, I hear you. What if I personally guarantee to be there myself, first thing Saturday morning? No crew, just me, and I'll knock twenty percent off the labor.

Character 1: [skeptically] Twenty percent doesn't fix my leaking roof that's been dripping for two weeks now. [sighs] Every time it rains, I'm... I'm putting buckets everywhere. [frustrated] My ceiling has water stains!

270 Customer Support: The roof—right, the emergency repair. Listen, I can get my brother-in-law there today, he's excellent with roofing. He'll at least tarp it temporarily until we can do the full job.

Character 1: [wearily] Your brother-in-law. [pause] [incredulous] So now we're bringing in random family members? [more firmly] I hired your company because of your reviews, which [bitterly] I'm starting to think were fake.

271 Customer Support: Those reviews are real, I swear. We've just hit a bad patch this month, and you're—you're catching the worst of it. Give me one more chance to make this right.

Character 1: [resigned] Fine. [long exhale] Send your brother-in-law for the tarp today. [more sternly] But if he doesn't show, I'm calling another contractor and [slowly] leaving reviews on every single platform I can find.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

272 [Fast] Okay so, I walk in there, right, and everyone just stops talking—like, dead silence. [Tsk] It was so obvious they'd been talking about me.

273 [Slow] You gotta understand something here... I've never, um, I've never done anything like that before in my entire life. [Sigh]

274 [Angry] She literally said—and I'm quoting here—that I was being "dramatic"! [Shout] Me! Can you believe that?

275 [Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda knew something was off when he wouldn't look me in the eye. [Chuckle] Should've trusted my gut.

276 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, apparently I'm the bad guy for, uh, for actually showing up on time. [Tsk] [Disappointed] Makes total sense.

277 [Happy] And then—wait, this is the best part—he actually apologized! [Laugh] Like, genuinely said he was wrong!

278 [Sad] I dunno, maybe I should've just... kept my mouth shut, y'know? [Slow] Maybe none of this would've happened.

279 Was I supposed to just stand there and—actually, you know what? [Fast] [Angry] Yes, I said what I said and I meant every word.

280 [Disappointed] The whole thing was basically a misunderstanding, but, um, nobody wanted to hear my side. [Sigh] Still don't, apparently.

281 [Whisper] [Fast] I'm gonna tell you something but you can't—you absolutely cannot tell anyone else, okay?

282 [Chuckle] Honestly? Looking back, it's kinda funny how worked up everyone got over, like, literally nothing. [Happy]

283 [Slow] Three times. [Angry] I asked him three times to just... to just listen for one second. [Groan]

284 [Sarcastic] Right, because I definitely woke up that morning thinking "hey, let's ruin everyone's day!" [Tsk] [Disappointed] That's exactly what I wanted.

285 [Fast] [Happy] No no no, wait—I forgot the part where she tried to blame it on the dog! The dog!

286 [Sad] [Whisper] I mean, if I could go back and—I dunno, maybe I wouldn't change anything actually.

287 [Shout] Twenty dollars! [Angry] We're having this whole argument over twenty stupid dollars! It's insane!

288 [Slow] You ever have one of those moments where you're like... this isn't actually happening to me right now? [Sigh] [Disappointed] Yeah.

289 [Happy] [Fast] So I just started laughing—couldn't help it—and that's when everyone realized how ridiculous we were being!

290 [Sarcastic] I'm sure my opinion doesn't matter, but, uh, since you asked so nicely... [Chuckle] Here's what really went down.

291 [Disappointed] Look, I tried to—actually, forget it. [Sad] [Sigh] You've already made up your mind about what happened anyway.

292 SCENARIO: Upset about a forgotten umbrella, then the rain stops completely

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my god, I am so annoyed right now. I cannot believe I forgot my umbrella this morning—like, I checked the weather, I saw it was gonna rain, and then I just... [groan] I just walked right out the door without it.

[irritated]

So of course it starts pouring the second I get to campus, and I'm just standing there under this tiny little overhang with like fifteen other people, all of us just staring at the sky like idiots. And I'm supposed to meet Professor Chen in twenty minutes but I can't even make it across the quad without getting completely soaked.

[exasperated]

I'm literally watching people with umbrellas just walking by all casual, and I'm like—ugh, that could be me right now if I wasn't such a— if I just remembered to grab the stupid thing from by the door where I literally keep it for this exact reason.
