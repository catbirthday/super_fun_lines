Character 1: Hit ten thousand yesterday.

417 Character 2: Wait wait wait—ten thousand what? Are you talking about the podcast? Because if you're telling me what I think you're telling me, I'm gonna literally lose my mind right now.

Character 1: Yeah. Ten thousand subscribers.

418 Character 2: Oh my god, okay—okay this is huge! This is like, this is actually huge! When you started weren't you hoping for like, what, a hundred people? [Gasp] Dude, ten THOUSAND humans chose to subscribe!

Character 1: It's just a number.

419 Character 2: No no no, don't you dare do that thing where you—where you downplay everything. This isn't just a number, this is like... you built something people actually want, y'know?

Character 1: I guess. Feels weird though.

420 Character 2: Weird how? Like imposter syndrome weird or like—wait, are you freaking out? Because honestly I'd be freaking out. That's so many people listening to your voice.

Character 1: Both? I don't know. Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.

421 Character 2: I'm sorry—quit? Did you just— [Laugh] okay that's the most you thing I've ever heard. You hit a milestone and your brain goes straight to "time to bail."

Character 1: What if they figure out I have no idea what I'm doing?

422 Character 2: Um, hello? Nobody knows what they're doing! That's like—that's literally the whole point. You think Joe Rogan knew what he was doing? Actually wait, bad example, but you know what I mean.

Character 1: He probably didn't stress about fonts in his show notes.

423 Character 2: Hold on—you stress about fonts? In the show notes? Babe, I guarantee you like, maybe three people have ever even opened those. [Chuckle] You're such a perfectionist, I can't.

Character 1: Three people is generous.

424 Character 2: See, there's that humor! That's—that's exactly why people love your show, right? You're like, you're real. Not trying to be all polished and fake and whatever.

Character 1: My mom says it's too depressing.

425 Character 2: Your mom also thinks podcasts are "those computer radio things," so maybe—I mean, I love her, but maybe she's not exactly your target demographic here?

Character 1: Fair point. Still feels like I'm tricking people somehow.

426 Character 2: Okay but like—ten thousand people aren't stupid, y'know? They chose you. They literally clicked subscribe because something about what you're doing... it works. That's not a trick, that's just—that's you being good at something. [Sigh] Let yourself have this win, please?

Script: f1011210_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told me how it ends.

427 Character 2: Wait, what? I didn't—oh god, are you talking about the thing I said yesterday? That wasn't me trying to spoil it, I literally thought you'd finished the season already.

Character 1: I told you I was on episode three.

428 Character 2: No, you said you were watching it! You said—okay okay, you said you started it like two weeks ago, so I just assumed... [sigh] I mean, who takes two weeks to watch eight episodes?

Character 1: People with jobs.

429 Character 2: That's—come on, that's not fair. I have a job too. And honestly, you're kinda always talking about shows you're "totally gonna watch" and then never do, so how was I supposed to know this was different?

Character 1: Because I was actually watching this one.

430 Character 2: Right, but I didn't—look, I'm sorry it got spoiled, okay? But you're acting like I did this to be mean or something. It was literally just me being excited about the twist and wanting to talk about it with someone.

Character 1: Cool. Thanks for that.

431 Character 2: Oh, so now you're gonna be—fine. [frustrated laugh] Be sarcastic. But y'know what? Maybe if you actually finished shows when they came out instead of taking forever, this wouldn't happen.

Character 1: It came out five days ago.

432 Character 2: And everyone else managed to—okay, that sounded worse than I meant. But seriously, the entire internet is talking about it. I've been dodging spoilers for you for days, and then I slip up once...

Character 1: You didn't slip up. You straight up told me.

433 Character 2: Because I thought you knew! God, I was being careful literally everywhere else—Twitter, work, with my roommate—and then with you, I just... I dunno, I relaxed because I figured we were safe to actually discuss it.

Character 1: Well. We weren't.

434 Character 2: Yeah, I get that now. And I am—I am sorry it happened. [scoff] But you could also maybe cut me some slack here? Like, it was an honest mistake, not some deliberate betrayal.

Character 1: Still ruined it.

435 Character 2: Okay but—that's what I mean. You're being kinda harsh about this. I didn't mean to, and yeah yeah, impact over intent or whatever, but... I dunno, feels like you care more about your show than the fact that I feel terrible about this.

Character 1: Do you though?

436 Character 2: Do I—wow. Yeah, actually, I do. But apparently that doesn't matter because I committed the unforgivable sin of accidentally discussing a TV show. Y'know what? Fine. Be mad. I'm gonna go.

Script: 98290310_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I won that baking thing yesterday.

437 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you WON? The whole—the whole competition? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna do amazing but like, this is huge! What did you make?

Character 1: Lemon lavender cake. Three layers.

438 Character 2: Lemon lav—okay that sounds absolutely incredible. Like, honestly? I'm not even surprised because remember that practice one you made last week? I literally [Gasp] ate half of it by myself.

Character 1: That one collapsed in the middle.

439 Character 2: No no no, but it still tasted like—I mean, who cares about structure when it tastes that good, right? So wait, what happens now? Is there like a prize or something?

Character 1: Five hundred dollars and a mixer. The fancy kind.

440 Character 2: FIVE HUNDRED—sorry, I just—wow. And a mixer? Those things are like, what, another three hundred? That's basically rent money! Are you gonna celebrate or...?

Character 1: I don't know. It's just baking.

441 Character 2: Just baking? Um, excuse me? You literally just beat—how many people were there? Like twenty? Thirty? This is not a "just" situation, this is a big [Laugh] freaking deal!

Character 1: Forty-two people entered. So.

442 Character 2: FORTY—okay now you're just being ridiculous. Forty-two people and you won? That's like, that's actually insane. You gotta let yourself be proud of this, y'know?

Character 1: My grandma used to make the same recipe.

443 Character 2: Oh... oh wait, is that—that's her recipe? The one you were telling me about? From when you were little? That makes it even more special, doesn't it?

Character 1: Yeah. Wish she could've seen it.

444 Character 2: Oh babe... she—I mean, in a way she kinda did? Through you? Like you're keeping her memory alive with every cake you make. That's really beautiful actually.

Character 1: The judge said it was "transcendent." Whatever that means.

445 Character 2: Transcendent! That's like—that's basically fancy judge speak for "this cake changed my life," right? [Chuckle] I'm telling everyone about this. My friend, the transcendent baker.

Character 1: Please don't make this a thing.

446 Character 2: Too late, it's already a thing! I'm gonna—actually, we're gonna go out tonight, okay? My treat. You can sit there all modest if you want but we're definitely celebrating.

Script: d449c9b3_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about the comments.

447 Character 2: Comments? What—oh. Oh no. Is this about the thing I said at dinner? Because I was just joking around, you know? I didn't mean anything by it, honestly.

Character 1: Every time we hang out, you have something to say.

448 Character 2: That's not—okay, maybe I've made a few jokes but like, I make jokes about everything, right? That's just how I am. I didn't realize it was bothering you this much. [nervous laugh] I mean, I should've noticed, shouldn't I?

Character 1: "Must be nice to have so much free time." "Government workers barely do anything." Ring a bell?

449 Character 2: Oh god, I did say that. I—wait wait wait, but I was being sarcastic! You know I don't actually think that. I was just—everyone makes those jokes about government jobs, I didn't think—

Character 1: Right. Everyone does it. So that makes it fine.

450 Character 2: No no no, that's not what I meant. [groan] I'm making this worse, aren't I? Look, I know those comments were stupid. Really stupid. I guess I was kinda... I dunno, maybe jealous? Of your benefits and stability and—that's not an excuse though.

Character 1: Jealous.

451 Character 2: Yeah, I mean—my job is such a mess right now and yours seems so... together? And instead of being happy for you I was being a jerk about it. Which is literally the worst way to handle it, I know.

Character 1: You could have just said that. Instead of making me feel like crap about my career.

452 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right. I should've—god, I should've just been honest instead of making those dumb passive-aggressive comments. I think I was trying to make myself feel better but obviously that's [sigh] that's so messed up. I'm really, really sorry.

Character 1: I worked hard to get this position.

453 Character 2: I know you did! That's what makes it worse—like, you studied for that exam for months, and you've been working your way up, and I just... minimized all of that. With stupid jokes that weren't even funny.

Character 1: They really weren't.

454 Character 2: They were terrible. Honestly, they were mean and I—I hate that I made you feel bad about something you should be proud of. Because you should be proud. Your job is important and you're really good at it.

Character 1: I actually do like what I do. Despite what you apparently think.

455 Character 2: No, I know—I mean, I see how passionate you are when you talk about your projects. When you're not around me being an idiot about it. [quieter] I'm gonna stop with the comments, I promise. Like, completely done. No more jokes about it.

Character 1: I just want you to respect what I do. That's all.

456 Character 2: You deserve that. You deserve so much better than how I've been acting. And I—I wanna be better. I will be better. Your friendship means everything to me and I've been such a crappy friend lately. Can we—can we maybe start over with this?

Script: 9551f637_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You lied to me about Alex.

457 Character 2: I didn't—okay, wait wait wait, that's not exactly what happened. You asked me what I thought and I—I mean, what was I supposed to say? "Yeah, your new boyfriend seems like a total jerk"?

Character 1: Yes. That's exactly what you should've said.

458 Character 2: Oh come on, that's—you're seriously telling me you would've been fine with that? You were so happy, like literally glowing, and I just... [sigh] I didn't wanna be the one to ruin that for you.

Character 1: So you pretended. For months.

459 Character 2: I wasn't pretending, I was—okay okay, maybe I was being overly positive about some stuff, but it's not like I was completely making things up. I was trying to be supportive, y'know?

Character 1: By lying to my face.

460 Character 2: That's not—ugh, you're making it sound so black and white. Look, I get that you're pissed, I do, but honestly? You kinda put me in an impossible position here.

Character 1: I asked for your honest opinion.

461 Character 2: No, you asked for validation. There's a difference. Every time I even hinted at something negative, you'd get all defensive and—[frustrated laugh] whatever, apparently I'm the bad guy for trying to protect your feelings.

Character 1: You made me look stupid.

462 Character 2: What? No—that's not what I was trying to do at all. How does me not trashing your boyfriend make you look stupid? That doesn't even make sense.

Character 1: Everyone else saw it. You saw it. I didn't.

463 Character 2: Okay but that's—that's on Alex for being fake, not on me for not wanting to burst your bubble. And honestly? I'm a little disappointed that you think I'd deliberately let you get hurt like that.

Character 1: You did let me get hurt.

464 Character 2: By trying not to hurt you? That's—[scoff] fine fine, I messed up, but at least my intentions were good. You're acting like I wanted this to happen.

Character 1: Your intentions don't matter now.

465 Character 2: They don't—wow, okay. So basically nothing I say matters because you've already decided I'm the villain here. Cool. Really mature way to handle this.

Character 1: Don't turn this around on me.

466 Character 2: I'm not—I'm not turning anything around, I'm just... y'know what? I'm sorry I didn't tell you Alex sucked. I'm sorry I tried to be a supportive friend. But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend like I did this malicious thing when we both know that's not what happened.

467 SCENARIO: waiting for their phone to charge enough to turn on

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, how long has it been? Like, five minutes? Ten? I plugged it in and then I— I don't know, I got distracted by, uh, by whatever. [sigh] Come on, phone. Just— just give me something here.

[slightly impatient]

I mean, it was completely dead, so that's— that's on me, I guess. But like, shouldn't there be enough juice by now to at least, um, to at least turn on? Even for like two seconds? [tsk] I just need to check if— if Sarah texted me back about tonight.

[hopeful]

Let me just— let me try pressing the button again. Maybe it'll— [pause] nope. Still nothing. Just that stupid black screen judging me for my, uh, for my poor charging habits. Which, okay, fair enough.

[resigned but chatty]

I should probably just, um, just leave it alone for like ten more minutes, right? That's what normal people would do. Patient people. But I'm not— I'm clearly not patient people because here I am talking to a dead phone like it's gonna, uh, like it's gonna suddenly care about my schedule.

[trailing off]

Maybe I should find a book or something. Do I even— do I even remember how to just... sit? Without scrolling? [laugh] This is gonna be interesting.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 47162168 | Role: Character 1 (A)

468 Character 1: [cheerfully] Sweetie, I've reorganized your entire apartment while you were at work! [getting faster] I color-coded your closet, meal-prepped for two weeks, and [giggling] even scheduled your dentist appointment for tomorrow at nine.

Character 2: [stunned] Mom, you... you broke into my apartment? [voice rising] I gave you that key for emergencies only. [firmly] This isn't okay—I'm twenty-eight years old and perfectly capable of managing my own life.

469 Character 1: [wounded] But darling, I was just trying to help! [quivering] The place was such a mess, and you never answer my calls anymore. [Soft sob] I worry about you constantly since you moved out.

Character 2: [exhausted sigh] I don't answer because you call fifteen times a day. [steadier] Look, I love you, but [pause] I need you to respect my space. These surprise visits have to stop immediately.

470 Character 1: [frantically] Fifteen times isn't that much when you think about it! [defensive] Your father thinks I'm being perfectly reasonable. [pleading whisper] Can't a mother just check if her baby ate breakfast and took vitamins?

Character 2: [controlled anger] Dad asked me to talk to you about this, actually. [slower] He said you've been sleeping in my old room, [shakily] crying over my baby photos every single night for months.

471 Character 1: [accusingly] Well, someone has to remember when you were sweet! [bitter laugh] Now you act like I'm some kind of burden. [dramatically] I gave up everything for you, my entire career, my whole identity!

Character 2: [gently] Mom, I never asked you to give up anything. [more firmly] You made those choices yourself. [Deep breath] Maybe it's time you found something new to focus on—a hobby, volunteering, literally anything else.

472 Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, wonderful advice from someone who can't even fold fitted sheets properly! [getting louder] You still need me, whether you admit it or not. [Nervous giggle] Who else would notice you're dating that terrible person?

Character 2: [shocked] You've been following me on dates? [voice cracking] Mom, that's stalking. [determined whisper] I'm changing my locks tomorrow, and if you don't respect these boundaries, we'll need to take a real break.

473 Character 1: [hysterically] A break? From your own mother? [Choking sob] This is exactly what happened with cousin Janet and look how that turned out! [whimpering] She died alone, probably calling for her ungrateful children!

Character 2: [calmly] Janet died peacefully surrounded by family who visited on healthy terms. [pause] Mom, I'm not abandoning you. [reassuringly] I'm asking for normal adult boundaries—weekly dinners, planned visits, maybe one daily text exchange.

474 Character 1: [desperately] But what if there's an emergency and I can't reach you immediately? [rapid words] What if you choke on dinner, or slip in the shower, or [Gasp] get kidnapped by internet people?

Character 2: [slight laugh] The internet people aren't coming for me, Mom. [seriously] Listen, I know empty nest is hard. [softer] Would you consider talking to someone professional about this anxiety you're experiencing lately?

475 Character 1: [offended whisper] You think I'm crazy now? [building volume] First I'm a stalker, now I need therapy? [Bitter chuckle] Maybe I should just pretend you don't exist like those modern parents do!

Character 2: [firmly] That's manipulative and you know it. [measured tone] Therapy isn't punishment—it's support during life transitions. [warmly] Dad mentioned you used to love painting; why not take that watercolor class at the community center?

476 Character 1: [quietly] You and your father have been discussing me behind my back? [hurt] I suppose everyone thinks poor Mom is just pathetic now. [Shaky breath] Fine, maybe I have been a tiny bit overwhelming.

Character 2: [relieved] Thank you for hearing me. [lovingly] Mom, you're not pathetic—you're just lost without your main job. [hopefully] Being my parent doesn't end, but the role has to evolve now.

477 Character 1: [reluctantly] I suppose calling three times daily would be excessive too? [Nervous laugh] The watercolor class does meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. [thoughtfully] Margaret from book club mentioned she's taking it; maybe I could actually join her.

Character 2: [warmly] That sounds perfect, and I'd love to see your paintings. [enthusiastically] How about Sunday dinners at your place? [tenderly] I'll even bring dessert—but Mom, you have to promise to return my apartment key.

Script: c713e50a | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] So I've been trying to figure out, um, how much I can put into my retirement thing for 2024? [hesitant] My friend Jerry said it's like $6,500 or maybe $7,500, but [trails off] I honestly can't remember if that's right.

478 Customer Support: Well, the contribution limits depend on several factors. For 2024, the basic 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000, not $6,500. [helpfully] However, if you're talking about an IRA, that would be $7,000 for most people.

Character 1: [surprised] Wait, twenty-three thousand? [laughs nervously] That's way more than I thought! My account number is, uh, let me see... R4589-something. [frustrated] Sorry, I can't find the rest of it right now.

479 Customer Support: [patiently] That's alright, we can look that up differently. Just to clarify though, are you asking about your employer's 401(k) plan, or do you have an Individual Retirement Account with us?

Character 1: [uncertain] I think it's the one through my work at 1247 Maple Drive—that's where I work, not where I live. [chuckles] Sometimes I get those mixed up! [more confidently] My boss said something about matching up to 6%.

480 Customer Support: [understanding] Ah, so you're referring to your workplace 401(k) plan. The $23,000 limit I mentioned is correct for that. [encouragingly] Plus, if you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution.

Character 1: [excited] Oh, I just turned 52 last month on the 14th! [calculating out loud] So that means I could do, what, thirty thousand and... [groans] math was never my strong suit. Is that $30,500 total then?

481 Customer Support: Exactly right—$30,500 total for 2024! That's the maximum you can contribute from your salary. [clarifying] Your employer's matching contributions don't count toward that limit, so that 6% match is extra money on top.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] Wow, okay, but like, I definitely can't afford to put in that much. [thoughtfully] Maybe I could do $400 a month? [sighs] Or is it better to do it per paycheck, like code it as B12 or something on my form?

482 Customer Support: Contributing $400 monthly would give you $4,800 annually, which is a great start! Most employers deduct per paycheck though. [practically] If you're paid bi-weekly, that would be about $185 per paycheck to reach your $400 monthly goal.

Character 1: [confused again] Bi-weekly means twice a month, right? [quickly] Or wait, is that semi-monthly? [frustrated laugh] These terms always confuse me—my employee ID is EMP78234, if that helps you see my pay schedule somehow.

483 Customer Support: Bi-weekly means every two weeks, so 26 paychecks per year. Semi-monthly would be twice a month, or 24 paychecks. I can check your pay frequency, but you'd need to verify that employee ID with your HR department first.

Character 1: [relieved] Oh good, I get paid on the 15th and 30th, so that's the semi one then. [calculating] So for $4,800 a year, divided by 24... [sighs heavily] that's $200 per paycheck, right? That seems doable.

484 Customer Support: Perfect math—exactly $200 per paycheck! That's a solid contribution amount that won't overwhelm your budget. Remember, this reduces your taxable income too, so your actual take-home pay won't decrease by the full $200.

Character 1: [interested] Really? How does that work exactly? [skeptically] My friend at 445 Pine Street, sorry, random detail, but she said she barely noticed when she increased her contribution to 8%. [hopefully] Is that true?

485 Customer Support: Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax, meaning they lower your taxable income. If you're in the 22% tax bracket, a $200 contribution might only reduce your take-home by about $156. So yes, the impact is less than the actual contribution amount.

Character 1: [amazed] That's actually pretty cool! [thinking aloud] So if I wanted to max out that catch-up thing eventually, with the $30,500 limit, [chuckles] I'd need to contribute what, like $1,270 per paycheck? [overwhelmed] That's basically my mortgage payment at 2890 Oak Lane!

486 Customer Support: Yes, $1,270.83 per paycheck to be exact—that's quite substantial! Most people work up to higher contributions gradually over time. As you get raises or pay off debts, [suggesting gently] you can increase your percentage slowly.

Character 1: [decisively] Okay, let's start with the $200 per paycheck then. [nervously] Do I need to fill out form 401K-CHG-2024 or something? [laughs] I'm just making up form names, but there's always so many forms with weird codes!

487 Customer Support: The form names can be confusing! [helpfully] You'll typically need to log into your employer's benefits portal or contact HR directly. [reassuringly] They'll have the correct change form, and most companies now let you adjust contributions online—no paper forms needed!

Script: d8004feb | Role: Customer Support

488 Customer Support: I understand you're upset about the advertised item, sir. Unfortunately, our—our weekly special on the flat-screen TVs sold out this morning. We had limited quantities, and they went faster than anticipated.

Character 1: [angrily] This is ridiculous! [raising voice] Your flyer says the sale runs through Sunday—it's only Thursday! How can you advertise something [frustrated pause] and not have it available for the entire sale period?

489 Customer Support: You're absolutely right to be frustrated, and I... I genuinely apologize for the inconvenience. We can offer you a rain check at the sale price, or perhaps look at comparable models with a discount.

Character 1: [sarcastically] A rain check? [groans] That's your solution? I drove forty-five minutes here [getting louder] specifically for this deal because your ad promised it would be available!

490 Customer Support: Forty-five minutes—that's quite a drive, and I can see why you'd be upset. Let me check with our district inventory system. Sometimes we can transfer items from nearby stores within twenty-four hours.

Character 1: [skeptically] Oh, now suddenly you can check other stores? [sharp exhale] Why wasn't this the first thing you offered? This feels like [bitterly] classic bait-and-switch tactics to me.

491 Customer Support: Sir, I assure you there's no bait-and-switch here. [more reassuringly] We genuinely ran out due to unexpected demand. I'm pulling up our inventory now—just, um, give me one moment please.

Character 1: [impatiently] Unexpected demand for an advertised sale item? [scoffs] That's literally the opposite of unexpected! You should've stocked more, or [accusingly] at least put "while supplies last" in giant letters!

492 Customer Support: You make a valid point about the advertising. Good news though—our Riverside location has three units left. I can reserve one right now and, given your drive today, offer an additional ten percent off.

Character 1: [cautiously] Ten percent off the sale price? [pause] [more calmly] Well, that's... that's actually somewhat reasonable. How far is Riverside from here, and [quickly] can you guarantee it'll be there when I arrive?

493 Customer Support: Riverside is twenty minutes east, and yes, once I complete this reservation, it's guaranteed yours. I'll need your name and phone number, and they'll hold it for forty-eight hours. [warmly] Would that work for you?

Character 1: [relieved sigh] Fine, yes, that would work. [more appreciatively] Thank you for actually finding a solution instead of just... apologizing repeatedly. The name's David Morrison, and [clearly] my number is 555-0147.

494 Customer Support: [professionally] Perfect, Mr. Morrison, I'm entering that now. The confirmation number is—is TV4521, and I'll also email you directions to Riverside with the manager's name who'll be expecting you.

Character 1: [curiously] Will they honor the extra discount without any hassle? [slightly worried] Because I really don't want to drive there and have another argument about this whole situation.

495 Customer Support: Absolutely no hassle—I'm noting everything in our system right now. Jessica, their manager, will have all the details, and [briskly] I'm also printing you a copy of this agreement with my signature.

Character 1: [appreciatively] Well, that's... that's very thorough of you. [chuckles softly] I'm sorry for getting so heated earlier, but [honestly] this kind of thing happens too often with sales nowadays.

496 Customer Support: No apology necessary—I'd be frustrated too in your position. These things shouldn't happen, and we're, um, actually reviewing our inventory forecasting because of situations like this. Here's your paperwork.

Character 1: [satisfied] Thank you for making this right. [more casually] The extra discount definitely helps with the inconvenience of driving to two stores. Maybe I'll [thoughtfully] actually become a regular customer after all.

497 Customer Support: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Morrison. Don't forget to ask Jessica about our loyalty program—with purchases like this, you'll earn significant points toward future discounts.

Character 1: [friendly] I'll definitely do that. [chuckles] Who knows, maybe this frustrating experience will turn into [optimistically] a better deal than I originally planned. Thanks again for your help today.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

498 [Disappointed] My boss literally told me I was, uh, "too ambitious" for wanting a promotion after three years. [Tsk] Can you believe that?

499 [Happy] [Laugh] You know what? Walking out of there was the most liberating thing I've done in—god, probably ever!

500 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, working sixty hours a week for a "pizza party" reward was totally worth it. [Groan]

501 [Angry] They promoted his nephew over me—his nephew who doesn't even know how to use Excel! [Shout] It's ridiculous!

502 [Whisper] Between you and me, I found out they were gonna lay off half our department anyway. [Fast] So I got out first.

503 [Sad] I just couldn't keep pretending everything was fine when I'd literally cry in my car every morning, you know? [Sigh]

504 [Slow] The commute was, um, slowly destroying my soul—two hours each way, every single day. [Disappointed]

505 [Fast] [Happy] I got this amazing offer and they wanted me to start immediately so I just—boom, two weeks notice, done!

506 [Chuckle] My coworker microwaved fish for the hundredth time and I thought, "That's it, I'm done." [Sarcastic] Best decision ever.

507 [Angry] [Fast] They kept piling on responsibilities without—I mean, zero extra pay, zero recognition, just more and more work!

508 [Disappointed] Honestly? The company values were just, like, words on a poster that nobody actually—they didn't mean anything. [Tsk]

509 [Slow] [Sad] When my dad got sick, they wouldn't give me time off to—to be with him, so...

510 [Whisper] I kinda discovered they were doing some pretty shady stuff with the books. [Fast] Had to get out before it blew up.

511 [Happy] Life's too short to be miserable eight hours a day, right? [Laugh] I'm gonna travel instead!

512 [Sarcastic] [Groan] Apparently suggesting improvements made me "not a team player"—sorry for trying to help, I guess?

513 [Shout] Five years without a single raise! [Angry] Not even cost of living adjustments—nothing!

514 [Slow] I realized I was becoming someone I didn't like—bitter, exhausted, just... not myself anymore. [Sigh]

515 [Fast] [Disappointed] The new management came in and basically gutted everything that made the place special, y'know?

516 [Chuckle] Would you believe I quit because of the coffee? [Happy] Nah, but seriously, that was definitely the last straw.

517 [Sad] [Whisper] I had a panic attack in the bathroom and thought—I can't, I just can't do this anymore.

518 SCENARIO: Casually describing a cough they've had, then counting the days, then realizing it's been weeks, ending in persistent symptom anxiety

==================================================

[casual]

Oh, I've had this weird little cough lately. Nothing major, you know? Just like a dry tickle thing that comes and goes.

[conversational]

I think it started when we went to that outdoor concert? Or maybe it was from the dust when I was cleaning out my closet. One of those things.

[matter-of-fact]

It's not even that bad, really. Just annoying sometimes, especially at night. I keep meaning to pick up some cough drops or whatever.

[thoughtful]

Actually, when did we go to that concert? That was... [pause] wait, that was like two weeks ago, wasn't it? Hm.

[a bit concerned]

Hold on, let me think about this. The closet thing was definitely before that, so that's not— [trailing off] When did this actually start?

[realization dawning]

Oh god. Oh no. The concert was three weeks ago. Three weeks. And I was coughing before that because I remember Sarah asking if I was getting sick.

[growing anxiety]

That's— that's over a month. I've had this cough for over a month and I just kept thinking it would go away and— [sharp exhale] what if it's not just a cough?

[spiraling] [nervous laugh]

What if it's something serious? People always say if you have a persistent cough you should get it checked and I've just been ignoring it like an idiot. [whimper] Oh my god, what if I'm dying?
