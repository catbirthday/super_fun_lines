Character 1: So you're taking Marcus to the wedding.

233 Character 2: I—okay, how did you even find out about that? Look, I was gonna tell you, I just... I knew you'd react like this and I wanted to find the right time.

Character 1: The right time. Sure.

234 Character 2: Don't do that. Don't—[sigh] I only had one plus one, alright? One. And Marcus is literally dating my cousin now, so there's this whole family thing where—

Character 1: We've been planning to go together for months.

235 Character 2: No no no, we talked about it, yeah, but we never like... officially planned it. You said "wouldn't it be fun" and I said "totally" but that's not—I mean, come on, that's not the same as making actual plans.

Character 1: Right. My mistake.

236 Character 2: That's not—ugh, you're twisting this. Look, I'm sorry you're hurt, okay? I am. But you're acting like I deliberately chose him over you to be mean, which is just... [frustrated laugh] that's not what happened.

Character 1: Then what happened?

237 Character 2: What happened is my mom called me last week—last week!—and basically informed me that Marcus needs to come because of some family drama I don't even wanna get into. And I tried to—I literally tried to get a second spot but they said no.

Character 1: You could've fought harder. Or told your mom no.

238 Character 2: Oh, okay, sure. Tell my mom no. Have you met my mother? She would've—god, she would've made my life hell for months. And honestly? You're being kinda unfair here.

Character 1: I'm being unfair?

239 Character 2: Yeah! Yeah, you are. Because I'm stuck between—look, I'm stuck between disappointing you or dealing with a massive family thing, and either way someone's pissed at me. [scoff] And you're supposed to be my friend, you're supposed to understand.

Character 1: Friends don't bail on each other.

240 Character 2: I'm not bailing! Jesus, it's one wedding. One. And it's not even—I mean, you don't even know the bride that well, so I don't get why this is such a huge deal.

Character 1: It was a big deal to me.

241 Character 2: Okay okay, fine. I get that now. But you gotta understand—I didn't know it meant that much to you. You never said. You just assumed I'd know, which isn't... that's not totally fair either.

Character 1: Whatever. Take Marcus. Have fun.

242 Character 2: Don't—come on, don't be like that. Look, I know I messed up, alright? I should've told you sooner, I should've... I dunno, handled it better. But I'm not gonna apologize for dealing with my family's crap the only way I could.

Script: f7579045_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You told my parents.

243 Character 2: I—yeah, okay, I did. But listen, you weren't eating for like three days straight and I was—I mean, what else was I supposed to do? You wouldn't talk to anyone.

Character 1: That wasn't your call to make.

244 Character 2: Maybe not, but you were literally passing out in class. Like, actually fainting. And you're gonna sit there and tell me I should've just... what? Watched it happen? [scoff] Come on.

Character 1: I had it under control.

245 Character 2: No, you didn't. You really, really didn't. And I'm not—look, I'm not gonna apologize for being worried about you dying or something, okay? That's not happening.

Character 1: So you just decided to ruin everything instead.

246 Character 2: Ruin—okay, that's not... [frustrated laugh] I was trying to help you. You get that, right? Like, I wasn't trying to get you in trouble or whatever you think this was about.

Character 1: Well, congratulations. You helped.

247 Character 2: Fine, be sarcastic. But you know what? At least your parents actually know now. At least someone's—I dunno, someone's actually doing something instead of just pretending everything's fine when it's obviously not.

Character 1: I never asked you to get involved.

248 Character 2: You didn't have to ask! That's—that's what friends do, they look out for each other. And honestly? I'm kinda disappointed that you can't see that. Like, you're more upset about your parents knowing than the fact that I was scared for you.

Character 1: You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.

249 Character 2: I know, and I—look, I know I broke that promise, okay? I do. But some promises... I mean, come on, you were asking me to basically watch you hurt yourself. That's not fair either.

Character 1: So your word means nothing.

250 Character 2: That's not—[sigh] okay, if that's how you wanna see it, fine. But I had to choose between keeping a secret and keeping you alive, and I'm not—I'm not gonna feel bad about which one I picked.

Character 1: You don't get to make that choice for me.

251 Character 2: Maybe not, but you weren't exactly making great choices yourself, were you? And I'm—look look, I'm sorry it happened this way, I am. But I'm not sorry I told them.

Character 1: Right. Got it.

252 Character 2: Don't—don't do that. Don't shut me out like this. I know you're mad, and you have every right to be, but I did it because I care about you. That's gotta count for something, doesn't it?

Script: 3ba9391b_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I got selected for that reality show.

253 Character 2: Wait wait wait—WHAT? You're kidding me right now. Which one? The one you applied for like, months ago? I thought you were just—oh my god, this is actually happening?

Character 1: The dating one. Yeah.

254 Character 2: The dating—okay, okay, I'm gonna need you to like, not be so casual about this because I'm literally freaking out [Laugh] for you right now. When do you leave?

Character 1: Three weeks. They want me there for two months.

255 Character 2: Two MONTHS? That's—wow, that's actually kinda terrifying, right? Like exciting but also... are you nervous? I'd be so nervous. Actually no, I'd be beyond nervous, I'd be like—

Character 1: I haven't told my parents yet.

256 Character 2: Oh. Oh no no no, that's—yeah, that's gonna be a whole conversation. Are they gonna watch? Can you imagine your mom seeing you on TV making out with someone? [Groan]

Character 1: Thanks for that image.

257 Character 2: Sorry, sorry! I'm just—my brain is going like a million miles an hour right now. But honestly? This is huge. You're gonna be famous. Like, people are gonna recognize you at Starbucks and stuff.

Character 1: It might not even air. Sometimes they don't.

258 Character 2: Okay but like—even if it doesn't, you still get to go! To wherever they're filming! Is it somewhere good? Please tell me it's somewhere tropical and not like, I dunno, Nebraska or something.

Character 1: Fiji.

259 Character 2: FIJI? Are you—[Gasp] okay I take back everything I said about being nervous. You HAVE to go. This is literally a free vacation where they film you... kissing strangers. Hmm.

Character 1: When you put it like that.

260 Character 2: No but seriously though, like—this is what you wanted, right? You seemed pretty excited when you first applied. Or are you having second thoughts now that it's... real?

Character 1: It's just a lot. The contracts alone are forty pages.

261 Character 2: Forty pages of—wait, what kind of stuff? Like, they own your soul forever type contracts or just boring legal whatever?

Character 1: Can't talk about production for five years. No phones. They control everything.

262 Character 2: That's... okay that's actually pretty intense. But you know what? You're gonna be amazing. And if you hate it, at least you tried, y'know? Better than always wondering what if.

Script: e33c36d7_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: That photo you posted. Really?

263 Character 2: What? The one from last night? I thought it was cute! We were having fun and you looked—okay, what's wrong with it exactly?

Character 1: I look terrible.

264 Character 2: You don't though! That's—that's what I don't get. You look fine, you look normal, you look like yourself having a good time. I wouldn't have posted it if I thought [scoff] you looked bad.

Character 1: Delete it.

265 Character 2: Are you serious right now? It's been up for like twelve hours, everyone's already seen it. And honestly? I still don't see what the problem is. You're being kinda—I dunno, dramatic about this.

Character 1: My eyes are half closed. My face looks puffy.

266 Character 2: Okay okay, maybe your eyes are a little—but that's just 'cause you were laughing! That's what people look like when they're actually having fun, not posing for some perfect Instagram thing. I mean, come on.

Character 1: You could've asked first.

267 Character 2: Since when do we—we never ask each other before posting stuff. We literally never do that. Last week you posted that video of me singing karaoke and did you ask? No. But I didn't freak out about it.

Character 1: That was different.

268 Character 2: How? How was that different? 'Cause from where I'm standing, it's exactly the same thing except you actually looked good in this photo and I looked [frustrated laugh] like a drunk idiot in that video.

Character 1: So now you're saying I'm overreacting.

269 Character 2: I'm not—ugh, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I genuinely, honestly thought you looked great. Like, I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't. I'm not trying to sabotage you or whatever you think this is.

Character 1: Three people already commented about how rough I look.

270 Character 2: What? No they didn't. Katie said we looked fun, Mark just put fire emojis, and—okay, who said you looked rough? 'Cause I didn't see that at all.

Character 1: Check again. Lauren's comment.

271 Character 2: Lauren's always—she's just jealous we didn't invite her. You know how she is. And one passive aggressive comment doesn't mean—look look, if it really bothers you that much, fine, I'll take it down. [sigh] But I still think you're wrong about how you look in it.

Character 1: Whatever. Just take it down.

272 Character 2: I will, okay? I'm gonna do it right now. But I'm also kinda—y'know what, never mind. It's fine. I'll delete it. But next time maybe tell me you wanna approve every photo before I post, since apparently that's what we're doing now.

Script: 85632852_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Everyone at work knows about my therapy now.

273 Character 2: Wait, what? I—okay, I mentioned you were seeing someone, but I didn't think that was like, a secret secret. You talk about your appointments all the time!

Character 1: To you. Not to them.

274 Character 2: But you never said—look, you literally told me about it at lunch with other people around! How was I supposed to know it was off limits? [frustrated laugh] I'm not a mind reader.

Character 1: Common sense would've been nice.

275 Character 2: That's—wow, okay. That's kinda harsh. I mean, you tell me everything and I'm supposed to just guess which things are private? You gotta communicate that stuff.

Character 1: I shouldn't have to.

276 Character 2: Yes, you should! Come on, that's not—you can't just assume I know what's okay to share and what's not. Especially when you're so open about it with me. That's literally not fair.

Character 1: So this is my fault?

277 Character 2: I'm not saying—[sigh] no, that's not what I'm saying. I'm sorry it got out, I am. But you're acting like I deliberately betrayed you when I honestly, honestly didn't know.

Character 1: You should've asked first.

278 Character 2: Maybe, yeah, but—okay okay, in hindsight, sure. But we share stuff about each other all the time! Remember when you told Jake about my promotion before I could? I didn't flip out on you.

Character 1: That's completely different.

279 Character 2: How? How is that different? It's—no, seriously, explain to me how that's different. Because from where I'm standing, it seems pretty similar, except I didn't make you feel like garbage about it.

Character 1: A promotion isn't therapy.

280 Character 2: Fine, you're right, it's not the same thing. But I'm just—I dunno, I'm frustrated that you won't even consider that this was an honest mistake. Like, do you really think I'd hurt you on purpose?

Character 1: Doesn't matter if it was on purpose.

281 Character 2: It does though! Intent matters—it has to matter. [scoff] I've been your friend for six years and you're ready to throw that away because I didn't realize something was a secret when you never told me?

Character 1: I need some time.

282 Character 2: Yeah, fine. Take your time. But just—I hope you remember all the secrets I have kept for you. Because there's been a lot, and I never once threw those in your face.

283 SCENARIO: waiting for glue to set

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, how long has it been now? Like, five minutes? The bottle says, uh, it says fifteen to twenty minutes for full bond, but I don't know if that's— if that's like, don't touch it at all, or just don't, um, don't put stress on it.

[slightly impatient]

I mean, it's just a stupid mug handle. How long could it possibly— [sigh] but if I check it too early and it, like, it falls off again, then I'm back to square one. Which is, um, which is annoying because this is my favorite mug and I really don't want to throw it away.

[contemplative]

Maybe I should set a timer? But then I have to find my phone, and I'm pretty sure it's upstairs somewhere. Or I could just, uh, I could just wait until that show I put on is over. That's probably close to fifteen minutes, right?

[fidgety]

God, why is waiting so— it's like watching paint dry, except worse because at least with paint you can see it happening. This is just... nothing. Just sitting here, staring at a mug, hoping some invisible chemical process is, um, is doing its thing.

[resigned but lighter]

Okay, okay, I'll just— I'll give it another ten minutes. Maybe do some dishes or something. Try to be, uh, try to be productive while my mug gets its life back together.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: 6a2442c7 | Role: Character 1 (A)

284 Character 1: [broken voice] We promised them freedom, Mikhail. [Choking sob] We swore on our mothers' graves that this would be different—that we'd build something beautiful. [quieter] Look at it burn... everything we fought for is just ash now.

Character 2: [hollow] The people trusted us. [Bitter laugh] They gave us their sons, their bread, their last kopecks. [voice cracking] And for what? So we could watch tyrants in new uniforms dance on the same old bones?

285 Character 1: [trembling whisper] Do you remember that first meeting in the cellar? [stronger] We were so certain, so pure in our conviction! [Gasping breath] Now I can't even recognize what we've become—murderers dressed as liberators.

Character 2: [accusingly] You signed the execution orders too, comrade. [softer, broken] But God, I never thought—children, Ana. [Ragged breath] We became the very monsters we sought to destroy, and I can't wash their blood away.

286 Character 1: [desperately fast] Maybe if we'd been more patient, more careful with the transition— [Sob] No, who am I fooling? [defeated whisper] The revolution devoured itself the moment we picked up those first rifles.

Character 2: [in disbelief] Three hundred years that palace stood. [louder, anguished] Three hundred years! And we burned it in three hours! [Muffled cry] All that history, that art, those libraries—gone because we couldn't control our own mob.

287 Character 1: [quivering] My sister died believing we'd create paradise. [more firmly] She bled out on these very stones, smiling, whispering about the future. [Shuddering breath] What do I tell her children when they ask why she's gone?

Character 2: [coldly] Tell them their mother died for an illusion. [warming, sad] Or better—lie. [Bitter chuckle] Say she died for something noble, something real, not this grotesque carnival of violence and betrayal we unleashed.

288 Character 1: [shouting] It wasn't supposed to end like this! [quieter each word] The philosophy, the ideals, the brotherhood of man... [trailing off] When did we trade our dreams for blood? When did justice become just revenge?

Character 2: [exhausted] The moment we stopped seeing faces and started counting bodies. [Dry laugh] Statistics, we called them. [in disgust] As if reducing humans to numbers somehow made the killing cleaner, more revolutionary, more justified.

289 Character 1: [pleading] There must be something we can salvage, some seed of good in all this ruin. [more desperate] Please, tell me those deaths meant something—that history will remember us as more than butchers!

Character 2: [sarcastically] Oh, they'll remember us alright. [serious, slow] As cautionary tales, as proof that good intentions pave roads to hell. [Weak laugh] Our names will be curses that mothers whisper to frighten naughty children.

290 Character 1: [in wonder] Look how beautifully it burns though. [horrified realization] God, what's wrong with me? [Strangled sob] I'm admiring the aesthetics of our failure while innocent people are probably still trapped inside those flames.

Character 2: [philosophically] Perhaps destruction is all we were ever capable of. [increasingly agitated] We knew how to tear down, to rage, to destroy! [deflating] But building? Creating? That required wisdom we never possessed, only arrogance disguised as conviction.

291 Character 1: [whispering] Do you think they'll forgive us? [louder] The next generation, I mean—when they see these ruins. [Shaky breath] Or will they curse our names every time they walk past these blackened stones?

Character 2: [gently] Forgiveness isn't for us to hope for, Ana. [harsher] We made our choices with open eyes and willing hands. [Long sigh] The best we can pray for is that someone learns from our spectacular failure.

292 Character 1: [suddenly urgent] We should leave—tonight—before the loyalists regroup. [quieter, resigned] Though where would we go? [Bitter laugh] What nation would harbor architects of such magnificent disaster? We're prisoners of our own making.

Character 2: [contemplatively] Running would be the final cowardice. [firmly] No, we stay and face whatever comes. [softer] At least in that, we can show the courage we lacked when it mattered—when we could have stopped this.

293 Character 1: [through tears] Hold my hand? [more steadily] If we're going to watch our dreams turn to ash, I don't want to do it alone. [Sob] Strange how the revolution gave us brotherhood only in its failure.

Character 2: [tenderly] Here, take it. [with finality] We'll stand witness to what we've done, together. [Shuddering breath] And when they write their histories, at least they'll say we didn't look away from the horror we created.

Script: c1a058cc | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my son Marcus—student ID 47329B—and I've been waiting [voice rising] three months for his IEP evaluation! [exhales sharply] This is completely unacceptable, we submitted everything back in September.

294 Customer Support: [apologetic] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about this delay, let me pull up Marcus's file right away. Can you verify the address we have on file—is it still 2847 Oak Ridge Drive?

Character 1: [impatiently] Yes, yes, that's correct, but that's not—look, [more forcefully] his teacher Mrs. Henderson even sent three follow-up emails with case number E-5521M. [sighs heavily] He's falling behind in math and reading without proper support!

295 Customer Support: I see the case number here, and you're absolutely right, this shouldn't have taken this long. [professionally] The evaluation request shows it was received September 14th, but somehow got stuck in processing—I'm escalating this immediately.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh wonderful, stuck in processing while my eight-year-old struggles every single day! [voice breaking] Do you know what it's like watching your child cry because he can't keep up? [more angrily] The law says 60 days maximum!

296 Customer Support: You're absolutely right about the timeline, and I can't imagine how difficult this has been. [more firmly] I'm putting you directly through to our Special Services Coordinator, Dr. Williams—she can schedule an emergency evaluation within 5 business days.

Character 1: [skeptically] Five business days? [laughs bitterly] That's what they said last time when I called reference number R-7789A. [demanding] I want this in writing, emailed to parker.mom42@email.com, with a guaranteed date!

297 Customer Support: I'm documenting everything right now and sending that confirmation email as we speak. Dr. Williams has an opening this Thursday, November 2nd at 10:30 AM—Can you come to the district office at 1500 Education Boulevard?

Character 1: [surprised] This Thursday? [cautiously optimistic] I mean, yes, absolutely, I'll rearrange everything to be there. [more seriously] But if this gets postponed again, I'm contacting the state board—complaint form 22-A is already half-filled out!

298 Customer Support: It won't be postponed, I'm personally guaranteeing that and putting priority code P1-URGENT on Marcus's file. You'll receive confirmation text to 555-0147 within the hour, and I genuinely apologize for everything your family has experienced.

Character 1: [softening slightly] Well, I—thank you for actually listening and doing something. [still wary] I've kept every email, every document since August 28th when we started this process. [sighs] I just want Marcus to get the help he deserves.

299 Customer Support: [understanding] Of course, and that's exactly what should have happened months ago. [informatively] Dr. Williams will review all your documentation at Thursday's meeting—bring any teacher observations or work samples you think would help the evaluation.

Character 1: [more calmly] I have a whole binder organized by subject with samples from the last semester. [thoughtfully] His pediatrician Dr. Kumar also wrote a letter—reference number MED-8834K—should I bring that too?

300 Customer Support: Yes, absolutely bring Dr. Kumar's letter, that medical documentation is incredibly helpful! I'm adding a note to your file about that right now—also updating your contact preference to email and text, is that correct?

Character 1: [relieved] Yes, that's perfect, email is best during work hours. [gratefully] Listen, I'm sorry for being so upset earlier, but—[emotionally] we've been fighting this system for so long, and Marcus asks me every day why school is so hard.

301 Customer Support: Please don't apologize, your frustration is completely justified and your advocacy for Marcus is admirable. After Thursday's evaluation, the full IEP team meeting will happen within 15 days—that's November 17th at the latest.

Character 1: [hopefully] November 17th, okay, I'm writing that down in my calendar right now. [more firmly] And Dr. Williams will be there Thursday, not some substitute or assistant, right? [nervously] Because that happened at Lincoln Elementary last year.

302 Customer Support: Dr. Williams herself will conduct the evaluation, I have her confirmation right here on my screen. She specializes in learning differences for elementary students—she's actually won three state awards for her innovative support programs.

Character 1: [impressed] Oh wow, I didn't know that about her credentials. [more positively] Maybe—maybe this delay will work out if we get someone that qualified. [decisively] Thursday, 10:30, district office, we'll be there twenty minutes early!

303 Customer Support: Perfect, and I'll be here if you need anything before then—ask for Janet, extension 4421. Marcus is lucky to have such a dedicated advocate—[sincerely] we'll make sure he gets every resource he needs to succeed.

Script: c4fe00f3 | Role: Customer Support

304 Customer Support: Good morning, this is Sarah from SolarBright Solutions. I'm calling regarding your installation scheduled for—um—last Tuesday. Unfortunately, we've encountered some delays with the permitting process.

Character 1: [frustrated] Wait, what? [louder] This is the third delay this month! [sighs heavily] I already took time off work, rearranged everything—my whole week was planned around this.

305 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. The city inspector flagged an issue with the electrical panel documentation, so we need to—well—resubmit everything. Should only be another week or two.

Character 1: [incredulous] Another week or two? [sarcastically] That's what you said last time, and the time before that. [exasperated] Do you people even know what you're doing over there?

306 Customer Support: Sir, I assure you we're doing everything possible to expedite this. Our team is working directly with the permit office daily—sometimes twice daily. These municipal delays are beyond our control.

Character 1: [bitterly] Beyond your control. [groans] That's convenient, isn't it? [demanding] I want to speak to someone who can actually give me a real date, not just excuses.

307 Customer Support: Of course, I can transfer you to my supervisor, but—um—let me first offer you something. We'd like to provide a $500 credit for the inconvenience. [hopefully] Would that help make this situation better?

Character 1: [skeptically] Five hundred dollars? [laughs bitterly] I've been waiting two months already! [firmly] My electricity bills are through the roof while your panels sit in some warehouse somewhere.

308 Customer Support: Actually, Mr. Johnson, your panels are already at our local facility, ready to go. Once we get the green light—which should be by Friday—we can install within 48 hours. [earnestly] I promise you're our top priority.

Character 1: [tiredly] You know what, Sarah? [sighs deeply] Fine, but I want that promise in writing—the Friday deadline, the installation within 48 hours, all of it. [resigned] And that credit better show up on my account.

Character 1: [cautiously] Also, what happens if Friday comes and goes with no permit? [more forcefully] Because I'm starting to think I should just cancel this whole thing and go with your competitor.

309 Customer Support: No, no, please don't do that, Mr. Johnson. If we miss Friday, I'll personally—um—escalate this to our regional manager. [more firmly] We'll increase the credit to $750 and guarantee a weekend installation.

Character 1: [considering] Weekend installation means overtime rates for your crews, doesn't it? [suspiciously] You're really going to eat that cost? [chuckles dryly] Something tells me Friday's deadline isn't as uncertain as you're making it sound.

310 Customer Support: [caught off guard] Well, I—we have strong indications from the permit office that— Look, between you and me, we're 90% sure it'll be approved Thursday. I just can't officially promise that yet.

Character 1: [irritated] So you've been stringing me along with maybes when you knew it was almost certain? [loudly] This is exactly the kind of runaround that drives customers crazy! [groans] Unbelievable.

311 Customer Support: I'm sorry, I should have been more transparent. Company policy prevents us from making guarantees until permits are in hand, but—yes—Thursday looks very likely. I understand why you're upset.

Character 1: [firmly] Alright, here's what's going to happen. [deliberately] You're going to email me right now—while I'm on the phone—confirming everything we discussed. [more sternly] The dates, the credits, everything.

312 Customer Support: Absolutely, I'm typing it up right now. Installation by Sunday at the latest, $750 credit, and—um—I'll include my direct line so you can bypass the call center. Does that work for you?

Character 1: [grudgingly] Yeah, that'll do. [sighs] But Sarah, if this falls through again, I'm not just canceling—I'm leaving reviews everywhere. [warningly] Your company can't keep treating customers like this.

313 Customer Support: [earnestly] I completely understand, and you have every right to feel that way. [quickly] The email's sent—please confirm you received it. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Johnson, we'll make this right.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

314 [Fast] So, uh, do you know the host or are you just—actually, I don't even know the host that well myself, I kinda got dragged here by my roommate. [Nervous laugh]

315 [Whisper] Is it just me or is the music, like, aggressively loud? [Tsk] I can barely hear myself think.

316 [Happy] Oh my god, I love your dress! [Fast] Where did you—sorry, that's probably weird, I just really like fashion.

317 [Sarcastic] Yeah, I'm having a blast standing by the snack table for twenty minutes. [Sigh] Peak party performance right here.

318 [Slow] Have you, um, have you tried the spinach dip thing? [Disappointed] It's... interesting.

319 [Shout] What? [Laugh] Sorry, I literally cannot hear you over this song!

320 [Sad] I used to be good at this whole mingling thing, but honestly, after lockdown, I'm just—I dunno how to talk to strangers anymore. [Sigh]

321 [Happy] Wait, you work in marketing too? [Fast] [Chuckle] Small world, I guess—which agency?

322 [Angry] My friend literally promised she'd be here by nine and it's—what time is it even? [Groan] She always does this.

323 [Slow] So... [Tsk] come here often? [Laugh] Sorry, that was terrible, I'm really bad at this.

324 [Whisper] Do you know if there's, like, a bathroom upstairs or—? [Fast] I've been wandering around for ten minutes looking.

325 [Disappointed] I thought this was gonna be more of a casual thing, but everyone's so dressed up and I'm just in jeans. [Sigh] [Slow] Story of my life.

326 [Happy] Your dog videos on Instagram are literally the only reason I survived Monday! [Laugh] [Fast] Sorry, that sounded less creepy in my head.

327 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, I always discuss cryptocurrency with random people at parties. [Tsk] It's, uh, it's my favorite topic.

328 [Shout] [Angry] Can someone please tell Brad to stop monopolizing the aux cord? [Groan] Nobody wants to hear his DJ mixtape!

329 [Slow] I'm trying this thing where I say yes to more invitations, but honestly—[Sad] [Sigh] I kinda just wanna go home and watch Netflix.

330 [Fast] Quick question: is it weird that I've been pretending to text for the last five minutes? [Chuckle] [Whisper] Because I definitely have been.

331 [Happy] No way, you're from Portland? [Fast] I went to Reed for like two years before I—well, before I dropped out, actually. [Laugh]

332 [Disappointed] The invite said "light refreshments" but I thought that meant, y'know, actual food? [Tsk] [Slow] These three crackers aren't really cutting it.

333 [Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, I'm totally the person who shows up alone to parties where I know nobody—it's kinda my thing. [Sigh] Living the dream.

334 SCENARIO: Frustrated about a gym membership charge, then remembers they never actually canceled it

==================================================

[frustrated]

Oh my god, you're not gonna believe this. I just checked my bank statement and there's another charge from that stupid gym— Fitness Plus or whatever it's called. Forty-nine ninety-nine, just sitting there like, like it belongs there.

[annoyed]

I haven't been to that place in like six months! I don't even— I think I went maybe three times total? And now they're just stealing money from me basically. [scoff] This is exactly why I hate gym memberships, they're such a scam.

[getting worked up]

I'm gonna call them right now and just— I'm gonna lose it on whoever answers. Like how is this even legal? I'm not using their stupid treadmills, I'm not— I don't even live near there anymore!

[trailing off, uncertain]

I mean, I definitely canceled it when I moved, I remember being really... really...

[realization dawning, quieter]

Oh. Oh no. Wait, did I actually— I remember thinking about canceling it. I remember being annoyed about having to go in person to cancel because of course they make you do that, but did I actually...?

[embarrassed] [half laugh]

Oh god. I think I just... forgot. I think I literally just forgot to cancel my gym membership. [groan] I've been paying for a gym I forgot I still belonged to.

[sheepish]

Okay so maybe I can't exactly call them and yell at them about stealing my money.
