I—okay, yes, but before you freak out, he's literally the nicest guy. He works at my office and he's been asking about you for weeks, super respectfully. I thought—I mean, I really thought you'd like him.
Look look, I know, but you keep saying you wanna meet someone and then you never actually—you never put yourself out there. And Jake's genuinely [sigh] a good person. I wouldn't have done it if I didn't trust him completely.
Okay okay, I get that, but it's not like I gave it to some random creep. This is someone I've known for two years who—honestly, who treats everyone with respect. I was trying to help.
No, you didn't. But you also—I mean, come on, you've been complaining about being single for months and then when I actually try to do something about it, you act like I committed some huge betrayal.
That's—that's really dramatic. I gave one trustworthy guy your number. One. [scoff] I'm not out here posting it on Craigslist or something. I used my judgment and yeah, maybe I shoulda asked first, but calling it betrayal is kinda harsh.
I didn't go behind—ugh, okay fine, technically yes, but I was gonna tell you! I just wanted him to text you first so it'd be like, I dunno, a nice surprise? Which sounds dumb now but at the time it seemed romantic.
And I'm sorry it feels that way, I am, but you're acting like I don't know you at all. Like I haven't been your best friend for eight years. I know what you like in a guy and Jake is literally—he's exactly your type.
Then what is the point? Because I'm trying to understand why you're this mad when—[frustrated laugh] when honestly, you seemed pretty happy when you told me about his texts yesterday. Before you found out I gave him your number, you were all excited.
Right, and suddenly he's what, contaminated? Come on. You liked him until you found out I helped make it happen. That's—that's kinda messed up actually. Like you'd rather stay single than admit I did something good.
Fine. Fine fine. I violated your privacy with good intentions and a trustworthy person who you actually like. I'm not gonna apologize for trying to—y'know what, whatever. Be mad. Block his number. I was trying to help but clearly that was stupid of me.
Oh my god, oh my god—I'm so sorry. I completely—I had it in my calendar, I swear I did, but then my mom called about this thing with my brother and I just... I totally spaced. That's not an excuse, I know.
Wait, what? The interview was—oh no. No no no, that was today? I thought—I thought it was next week? [groan] God, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I did this to you.
I did. I did know, you're right. I just—everything's been so crazy lately and I've been trying to juggle like seventeen different things and I—that doesn't matter. None of that matters because I promised you I'd be there.
Shit. It was raining? Of course it was raining. Because I couldn't just—I couldn't just forget on a nice day, right? [nervous laugh] Sorry, that's not funny. I'm gonna make this up to you, I swear.
I'll call them! The company, I mean. I'll call and explain it was my fault—wait, no, that's stupid, they won't care. Um, maybe I could—do they have other openings? Or I could reach out to my cousin, y'know, the one who works in HR somewhere?
Different cousin! I have—okay, yeah, she's actually between jobs right now but she used to know people. Look, I'm trying here. Just... please let me fix this somehow?
Don't say that. Please don't—I mean, I get it, you're mad and you have every right to be, but we've been friends for what, six years? Seven? This can't just be... done.
I know. I know I have. It's been—honestly, I've been kinda falling apart since the breakup and I keep dropping the ball on everything. But that's my problem, not yours, and I shouldn't have—I shouldn't let it affect you like this. [sigh] I'm really, really sorry.
Yeah, well, I'm not—I'm not handling it great, okay? But that's still not... you needed me and I wasn't there. And that's—that's not okay. I wanna be the friend you deserve, I really do.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I don't—I don't have any more excuses. All I can say is I'm sorry and I'll do better. Actually do better, not just say it. If you'll give me another chance.
Oh my god, oh my god—I'm so sorry. I just—I totally spaced, and I know that's not an excuse but I've been so scattered lately and—wait, third time?
No no no, you're right, you're totally right. I'm—god, I'm the worst friend ever. I literally had it in my calendar and then I just—I don't know what happened, I got caught up with work stuff and [groan] that sounds so lame even saying it out loud.
An hour? You waited—oh my god, why didn't you call me? Actually no, that's—that's on me, not you. Of course you shouldn't have to call me to remind me of plans we already made. I'm so, so sorry.
I know, I know it does and I hate that I keep doing this to you. Like, genuinely, I don't mean to—I'm not trying to be flaky, I swear. My brain's just been like... everywhere except where it needs to be lately [nervous laugh] which isn't your problem, I know.
What? No! No no no, absolutely not. You're—you're literally one of my favorite people, I just—I'm really bad at managing my time and keeping track of things and that's completely on me, not you. Never you.
I know. God, I know and I—I get why you'd think that. But honestly, it's not about you at all, I've been forgetting everything lately. My mom's birthday, my dentist appointment—I even missed a job interview last week. [sigh] I'm kinda falling apart, basically.
Yeah, um—the one I told you about? For that marketing position? I just... completely blanked. Woke up the next day and realized. But that's—we're not talking about me right now. I wanna make this right with you.
Maybe I—yeah. Yeah, you're probably right. I've been thinking maybe I should like, I dunno, see someone or get one of those planner apps or something because clearly whatever I'm doing isn't working and I'm hurting people I care about.
I know. And I—I really wanna do better. Like, actually do better, not just say it. Would you maybe wanna help me figure out a system or something? So I stop being such a disaster of a human being?
Deal. Absolutely deal. And um—thank you. For not just writing me off completely. I know I don't deserve—just, thank you. [quieter] I really am gonna try harder, I promise.
Bought—wait, bought what? Oh my god, you didn't. Did you actually—did you get the car?
Shut up shut up shut UP! Are you—I can't believe you actually did it! You've been talking about that car since, like, literally since we were kids. This is—[Gasp] this is huge!
Okay, so we're gonna need to—I mean, obviously I'm coming over right now. Like right now. Have you driven it yet? Please tell me you've driven it.
That's—that's it? You got your literal dream car and you drove it around the block? Twice? What are you even—why aren't you on the highway right now?
Weird like... good weird or like, oh-shit-what-did-I-do weird? Because honestly, dropping that kind of money would make me [Nervous laugh] kinda freak out too.
Oh babe, no no no, that's—okay, that's actually really normal. It's like, when something you've wanted forever finally happens, your brain just... doesn't know what to do with it, y'know?
Oh. Oh honey, yeah, he—he really would've. Remember how he used to take us to those car shows? And he'd always stop at the Mustangs and just... [Sigh] I bet he's proud of you right now.
Because you can't—you can't share it with him? God, that's... I mean, that makes total sense. It's like the happy and the sad are all mixed up together.
You know what though? I think—okay, this might sound dumb, but like, maybe take him for a drive anyway? In spirit or whatever. Play his music, go to that scenic route he liked?
See? That's—that's perfect. And hey, I'll come with if you want. Or not, totally up to you. But either way, that car isn't gonna disappear, okay? It's yours. You did this.
[high-pitched] Oh my god, did you feel that? [trembling] The plane just dropped like—like a stone! [Gasping breath] We're all going to die, aren't we? I knew I should've taken the train instead of flying today.
[whimpering] Sorry, sorry, I just—[Sharp intake] WHAT WAS THAT? [frantically] The lights flickered! Do lights flicker before crashes? My cousin's friend's neighbor said that lights flickering means electrical failure and then we plummet!
[shakily] I don't have a paper bag! [getting higher] Should I have brought one? [Nervous laugh] The safety card doesn't mention paper bags anywhere—I've read it seventeen times since boarding. Is seventeen unlucky?
[desperately] You fly twice a week? [louder] How are you not terrified? [quivering whisper] Every bump feels like the wing's about to snap off. Can wings snap? They look so thin and bendy from here!
[panicked squeak] THREE HOURS? [breathlessly] I thought we only had one more! [moaning] Oh no, oh no, I can't do three more hours of this death trap bouncing around like popcorn in a microwave!
[hopefully] A game? [suspiciously] Like what kind of game? [faster] Not twenty questions about plane crashes, right? Because my mind's already playing that on repeat with extremely vivid graphics and sound effects!
[uncertainly] The bathroom? [horrified whisper] People use the bathroom during turbulence? [getting louder] What if they get thrown around in there? What if the door gets stuck and they're trapped when we crash?
[weakly] Vending machines? [confused] That's supposed to be comforting? [Hysterical giggle] Now I'm scared of vending machines AND planes! Thanks for doubling my anxiety! What's next, escalators are secretly plotting humanity's demise too?
[softer] You're right, you're right. [shaky breath] I'm being ridiculous, aren't I? [Nervous chuckle] My therapist did say I catastrophize. Sorry for being such a nightmare seatmate on your business trip.
[gratefully] That's really nice, thank you. [steadier] Mint or cinnamon? [Small laugh] See, I can have normal conversations when I'm not convinced we're plummeting! Though that bump just now made my heart skip seventeen beats.
[apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, but when I search RX47B92K in our system, nothing comes up. [calmly] Could you perhaps check if maybe, um, you booked with a different company? [hesitant] Sometimes customers confuse us with Enterprise or Hertz.
[defensive] Well, sir, I'm looking at every reservation for today, March 15th, and there's no booking under your name. [more firmly] Could you spell your last name again? [sighs] Maybe it's under a different spelling or your corporate account?
[typing tone] Okay, I see you in our system as a Gold member, but... [confused] the last reservation I show was in January, confirmation AZ66M10P. [more apologetically] Sir, are you absolutely certain you received a confirmation email from us?
[defensive] Sir, there's no need for that tone. [more calmly] Let me try searching by your credit card—the last four digits? [sighs heavily] Sometimes the system, well, it doesn't sync properly between online and our counter.
[surprised] Oh wait—I think I... [hesitant] Sir, did you book for March 15th or May 15th? [nervously] Because I'm seeing RX47B92K here but it's showing for May, not March. [quietly] That would explain everything.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration completely, and I'm so sorry about the delay. [quickly] Our maintenance team has been overwhelmed with, uh, emergency repairs, but [more reassuringly] I'll escalate this to priority status right now.
[briskly] You're absolutely right, this isn't acceptable at all. [more firmly] Let me check the system... okay, I see the work orders were never properly assigned. [quickly] I'm personally scheduling someone for tomorrow morning, guaranteed.
[earnestly] I completely understand why you don't trust us right now. [speaking faster] Here's what I'll do—I'm sending you the technician's direct number, and [more confidently] if they don't show by noon, I'll authorize a rent reduction.
[quickly] The mold issue, yes, I see those reports here too. [professionally] Since we're already sending maintenance tomorrow, I'll—I'll make sure they assess both problems. [reassuringly] One visit, both issues addressed, no more runaround.
[efficiently] Absolutely, I'm drafting the email right now as we speak. [rapidly] You'll have it within ten minutes with all details, my supervisor's signature, and [more slowly] our sincere apologies for this unacceptable situation.
[chuckles softly] Actually, I'm the regional manager filling in today. [seriously] These complaints reached my desk this morning, and honestly, [disappointed] I'm not happy with how my team handled this.
[confidently] Not only will it happen, but I'll be there personally to ensure everything's done right. [briskly] Eight AM sharp, both repairs, plus [more warmly] I'm bringing space heaters for tonight.
[sympathetically] As a parent myself, I completely understand that frustration. [quickly] The heaters will arrive within two hours, and [firmly] this won't happen again on my watch, I promise.
[decisively] You're right to ask about long-term solutions. [rapidly] We're implementing a new maintenance response system, quarterly unit inspections, and [more deliberately] a direct hotline to my office for urgent issues.
[urgently] Please don't make any decisions until after tomorrow's repairs. [earnestly] We value you as a tenant, and I think—no, I know—we can restore your confidence. [warmly] See you at eight AM sharp.
[Angry] This is—oh come ON, not now, not TODAY of all days! [Groan] They're gonna be here in, what, twenty minutes?
[Fast] Okay okay okay, where's the plunger, where did I—it's gotta be around here somewhere, right? [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, yeah, this is exactly how I wanted to spend my afternoon. [Sigh] Just me and the toilet having a moment.
[Whisper] Please, please just go down, I'm literally begging you right now.
[Happy] Wait, I think it's actually—yes! [Laugh] Oh thank god, it's finally working!
[Disappointed] I, um, I really thought that would fix it, but it's still just... sitting there. [Sigh]
[Shout] Can someone grab me the—actually, never mind, I'll get it myself!
[Slow] You know what, maybe if I just, like, wait a few minutes it'll kinda resolve itself?
[Sad] This is so embarrassing, I mean, what am I gonna tell them when they need to use the bathroom? [Groan]
[Fast] [Angry] I don't have time for this, I really don't have—ugh, why is nothing working?!
[Chuckle] Honestly, this would be funny if it wasn't, you know, literally about to ruin my entire party.
[Whisper] [Slow] Just gonna try one more time, nice and easy, no sudden movements.
[Disappointed] The plumber said he can't get here until tomorrow, so that's, uh, that's not gonna help. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] [Laugh] Great, now there's water on the floor too—this just keeps getting better!
[Happy] [Fast] My neighbor has a snake thingy, she said I can borrow it right now!
[Angry] [Shout] Who puts an entire roll of paper towels in here?! WHO DOES THAT?!
[Slow] [Sad] I guess we could just, um, put an out of order sign on it?
[Fast] Google says baking soda and vinegar, but like, do I even have time to—okay, worth a shot.
[Disappointed] [Sigh] Seven people coming over and one working bathroom—this is gonna be a disaster, isn't it?
[Happy] [Chuckle] You know what, forget it, we're just gonna laugh about this later, right?
I didn't—okay, wait, that's not what happened. I wasn't taking anyone's side, I was just trying to help. You guys were both upset and I thought—I dunno, I thought maybe I could fix things.
Because I thought I knew! She told me the whole story and it sounded like—[sigh] look, it sounded pretty straightforward. Was I supposed to assume she was lying?
Okay okay, but you weren't answering your phone! And she was like, crying, and I—what, I'm just gonna tell her to wait while I track you down? Come on.
I mean... yeah? She's my friend too, y'know? And honestly, the way she described it made sense. I'm not saying you're wrong, but like—I had to make a judgment call [frustrated laugh] and apparently I made the wrong one.
That's—wow, okay. You're really gonna be like this? I was trying to help. Maybe I messed up, fine, but I wasn't trying to hurt you or—or betray you or whatever you think this is.
No no no, that's not—I said maybe you both needed space to cool off. That's different. You're twisting what I—[groan] this is exactly what I was trying to avoid.
I wasn't picking—! Ugh, you know what? Fine. Maybe I should've waited to hear your version. But you're acting like I did this maliciously when I literally just wanted everyone to stop fighting.
That's not fair. That's really not fair. I've had your back so many times, and now—one time—I make a call without consulting you first and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever? Seriously?
I didn't mean to! God, I—look look, I'm sorry that's how it came across, okay? But I'm also kinda frustrated that you won't even consider that maybe I was in an impossible situation here. Like, what was the right move? Tell me.
Yeah, well... [scoff] hindsight's pretty convenient, isn't it? I'm sorry I'm not perfect. I'm sorry I tried to help and made things worse. But I'm not gonna apologize for caring about both of you.
Oh god, okay—I know, I know what you're gonna say. I was being a total jerk about the movie thing, wasn't I? Like, I just kept going on and on about how the book was better and—ugh, I'm doing it again, aren't I?
Wait, every time? That's—okay no, you're right. You're totally right. I do, don't I? [nervous laugh] It's just like, I get so caught up in wanting to explain my point that I don't even realize I'm—I'm basically steamrolling everyone else.
Oh my god, Jake's story—I literally corrected him about his own vacation. That's... that's actually insane. Like who does that? I just—I heard him say Prague was in Poland and my brain just went into autopilot mode, y'know?
I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. It's not—I don't think I'm better than everyone, I swear. My mom used to do this exact same thing and I hated it [groan] and now I'm literally turning into her.
That's not—no wait, that is true, isn't it? God, you must feel like you're walking on eggshells around me. Like you can't just... talk without me jumping in with some "well actually" bullshit. That's so messed up.
I think maybe I just—okay this isn't an excuse, but like, growing up I always felt kinda stupid? And now when I know something, I just... I dunno, I wanna prove I'm not? But that's not fair to you. Or anyone.
Ha, yeah that's—that's actually worse somehow. Um, look, I know saying sorry doesn't fix it, but I genuinely wanna work on this. Like, maybe you could... I dunno, give me a signal when I'm doing it? [nervous laugh]
Oh. Oh shit, really? I just—I completely missed that, didn't I? God, I'm so sorry. You've been trying to tell me and I just kept... being me. That must've been so frustrating.
Yes. Yes, absolutely. I'm gonna—I'll literally bite my tongue if I have to. And if I slip up, which I probably will at first 'cause habits are hard—but just, just call me out immediately, okay? I promise I won't get defensive.
Thank you for—for telling me. I know that wasn't easy. And I know I've probably made you feel like your thoughts don't matter, but they do. They really, really do. I'm gonna do better, I promise.
Oh god, I—I was gonna tell you, I swear. It's just been so crazy lately and I kept waiting for the right time to—okay that sounds terrible when I say it out loud.
I know, I know, that's—that's way too long. I just kept chickening out because I knew you'd be upset and then the longer I waited the worse it got, y'know? Like I'd think about telling you and then [nervous laugh] I'd literally just panic.
No no no, that's not—Marcus only knows because he saw the boxes when he came over. I didn't mean for him to find out before you, honestly. You're literally the person I wanted to tell most but also the person I was most scared to tell? If that makes sense?
Right. Yeah, no, you're right. I'm—I'm really messing this up. [Sigh] Look, I've been terrified of this exact conversation because you mean so much to me and I didn't wanna—I couldn't handle the thought of you hating me.
It wasn't lying! It was—okay, fine, omission is basically lying. You're right. I just kept telling myself I'd tell you tomorrow, and then tomorrow would come and I'd be like "oh but we're having such a good time, I don't wanna ruin it" and—god, I'm such a coward.
Um, end of next month. But wait wait wait—I'm gonna visit all the time! Like, seriously, I already looked up flights and they're super cheap if you book in advance, and my new job is remote three days a week so I can basically work from here sometimes.
That's—that's actually why I'm moving. They offered me this insane position and I couldn't turn it down but—I shoulda talked to you about it. [Groan] You've always been the person I go to for big decisions and I completely shut you out of this one.
I'm sorry. Like, genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I know those are just words and they probably don't mean much right now but—I dunno, I guess I was so scared of losing you that I ended up doing exactly the thing that would make me lose you anyway.
I know. I know you wouldn't have, you're—you're literally the most supportive friend I've ever had. That's what makes this worse, honestly. You woulda been happy for me even though it meant me leaving and I just... I robbed us both of that, didn't I?
Yeah, totally, of course. Take all the time you need. I just—can we maybe get coffee before I leave? Even if you're still mad? I promise I'll tell you everything, like every single detail about the job and the apartment and—everything. No more secrets, I swear.
Oh... oh no. Listen, I—I know how this looks, okay? I know I haven't texted you back and that's—that's really shitty of me, I get it.
I know, I know! And I kept meaning to—like, I literally opened it so many times but then I'd get distracted or someone would call me or—[groan] that sounds so lame. I'm sorry, that's such a bad excuse.
That's not—okay, yeah, I see how that looks really bad. It's just, posting is like... mindless? Y'know? But texting you back, I wanted to give you like a real response, not just some half-assed thing while I'm—wait, that's making it worse, isn't it?
No no no! That's not what I meant at all! You're not—god, I'm really messing this up. [nervous laugh] You're important to me, like really important, which is why I wanted to... to actually have the mental energy to respond properly? But then I just kept putting it off and—ugh, I'm the worst.
I deserve that. I really—I totally deserve that. Look, I've been doing this thing where I just... scroll mindlessly when I'm anxious? And posting stories is like, two taps, but actually having conversations feels... overwhelming sometimes? That's not an excuse though, I'm just trying to—to explain, I guess.
I know. Shit, I—I really do, don't I? It's like this stupid pattern and I keep saying I'll be better but then I just... don't. [sigh] I'm literally the worst friend, I don't even know why you put up with me honestly.
Wait, please don't—okay, I deserved that too. But seriously, I wanna fix this. Like, actually fix it, not just say I will and then go back to being a crappy friend who can't even text back.
Too many. Way too many times, you're right. But maybe—maybe you could call me out? Like, immediately? When I do it? Because sometimes I don't even realize I'm—that's not your job though, is it? God, I'm asking you to manage my issues for me, that's so unfair.
I'm still—I'm still here, I promise. I've just been really bad at showing it and that's... that's on me. Completely on me. Y'know what? I'm gonna text you back right now. Like literally right this second. And tomorrow. And the day after.
No, you're—you're right. Okay. How about... I'll just try to be better? One day at a time? And if I don't text back within like, a day, you have full permission to spam me with those awful memes you love. [quieter] I really am sorry. I miss talking to you too.
Wait wait wait—the teaching one? The one at—oh my god, are you serious right now? That's amazing! I mean, I knew you'd get it but like, this is actually happening!
Fall semester, that's—that's so soon! Okay okay, tell me everything. Like what grade are you gonna be teaching? Is it the school you really wanted or was it the other one?
The good—[Laugh] of course you'd call it that. But no, seriously, that's literally perfect for you. You're gonna be so good with those kids, they have no idea what they're in for.
Um, excuse me? Just teaching? No no no, you've been talking about this for like—what, three years now? This is huge! Are you not, like, even a little bit excited?
Oh. Oh okay, yeah that's—I get that. It's probably kinda overwhelming, right? Like you work so hard for something and then suddenly it's real and you're like... now what? [Softer] That makes total sense actually.
Right, the commute would be—wait, are you nervous about that? Moving? Because honestly, a fresh start might be exactly what you need, y'know?
Yeah but like—okay think about it this way. New apartment, new job, new everything. You can basically reinvent yourself if you want to. That's kinda exciting, no?
That's—[Chuckle] okay fair point. But still, you're gonna be amazing at this. Like, remember when you tutored my cousin? She literally went from failing to getting B's.
How? How is it different? You're good at this stuff—explaining things, being patient, all of it. Those kids are so lucky to have you, seriously.
No, we won't "see"—we already know. You're gonna walk in there and just... be yourself, and that's gonna be more than enough. I'm really, really proud of you, y'know? This is everything you wanted.
[trembling voice] Look at her up there, our baby girl. [Sniffling] She's speaking with such confidence, such grace—remember when she was terrified of presentations? [whispered] I can't believe this is real.
[through tears] Did you hear what she said about overcoming her learning disability? [voice breaking] She turned every single struggle into strength. [louder] I'm recording this but I can barely hold the phone steady right now!
[excitedly] She's mentioning the science fair disaster! [Soft laugh] When her volcano exploded all over the judges, we thought her academic career was over. [getting quieter] Now she's headed to MIT on full scholarship.
[breathlessly] Her voice just cracked talking about her brother's support. [increasingly emotional] Even from across the country, he's watching the livestream. [Gasping] Oh God, she's looking right at us now with those beautiful eyes.
[nostalgic whisper] She would have been the proudest grandmother alive. [stronger] Remember when we worried she'd never catch up academically? [Nervous laugh] Now she's giving advice to five hundred graduates about pursuing excellence.
[barely audible] The standing ovation is starting already. [building volume] Everyone's on their feet before she's even finished! [Loud sob] My heart might actually burst from this much pride in one human being!
[fierce pride] She just mouthed "I love you" to us! [Shuddering breath] How did we create someone so magnificent, so capable of moving mountains? [softer] I'm going to need tissues for the rest of my life.
[defensive but loving] And her determination from you! [Snorting laugh] Oh no, she's doing the thing where she adjusts her cap when nervous. [tenderly] Some things never change, even when your baby becomes valedictorian.
[wobbly voice] Did you get photos of every second? [frantically] Please tell me the video is still recording because I was crying too hard to see half of it! [Breathing heavily] We'll watch this forever, won't we?
[exhausted joy] My face hurts from smiling and crying simultaneously. [Shaky laugh] Is this what they mean by happy tears creating rivers? [contemplatively] I never knew pride could physically hurt this good inside your chest.
[professional] Good afternoon, I'd be happy to help you with your sync issues. [reassuringly] Could you please provide me your account email or customer ID number? [more clearly] That's the 8-digit code starting with CS.
[patiently] I found account CS4523876 under johnsmith82@cloudmail.com. [more focused] Now, when you say files aren't there, are they missing from folder A-1247 on your desktop, [slower] or not appearing on your laptop device ID LPT-9982X?
[calmly] I understand your frustration, sir. [more technically] Our logs show your last sync from IP address 192.168.1.42 was interrupted at 3:47 PM. [helpfully] Have you checked if both devices are running client version 7.2.1 or higher?
[sympathetically] The endless spinning usually indicates a connection issue. [more directly] Can you click Help, then About, and read me the version number? [encouragingly] Also, are you connected to network "Home_5G" or "Home_2.4G" on address 421 Maple Street?
[gently] Ah, there's our problem—version 6.8.3 is outdated. [more firmly] You'll need to manually update to 7.2.1 by downloading patch KB2024-887. [reassuringly] Once updated, your 47.3 GB of data should sync properly within 15-20 minutes, depending on your connection speed.
[briskly] Next customer, please! [cheerfully] Hi there, how can I help you today? Returns are right here at this counter.
[quickly] Alright, let me pull up your receipt in the system. [more cautiously] I do see here that unopened appliances have a fifteen percent restocking fee. Will that be okay?
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, really. [speaking faster] The fee covers processing and inspection costs—it's printed on the receipt and posted at checkout, but [more gently] I know it's easy to miss.
[sympathetically] Let me check with my manager real quick. [more optimistically] Since you're a rewards member and it's unopened, maybe—just maybe—we can work something out for you.
[brightly] Good news! [speaking rapidly] My manager approved a one-time courtesy waiver, so you'll get the full refund. Just need your signature here and we're all set.
[Sad] I literally just said that exact same thing five minutes ago, but, um, nobody even—it's like I wasn't even there. [Sigh]
[Angry] [Fast] Oh great, yeah, just talk right over me again, that's totally fine, I'll just sit here like furniture I guess.
[Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm, like, actually a ghost and just don't know it yet. [Chuckle]
[Disappointed] [Slow] I used to be the one everyone turned to, you know? Now I'm just... background noise.
[Sarcastic] Wow, thanks for acknowledging my existence when you need someone to, uh, split the check with. [Tsk]
[Happy] Wait, you actually heard what I said? [Laugh] That's—that's honestly the highlight of my whole week!
[Sad] [Whisper] I could probably just leave right now and nobody would notice for, like, an hour at least.
[Angry] [Shout] HELLO? I'M LITERALLY RIGHT HERE! Can anybody—does anyone even see me?
[Disappointed] I keep trying to jump into the conversation but it's like there's this, um, invisible wall or something. [Groan]
[Fast] [Happy] Oh my god, someone finally asked my opinion about something, quick, I gotta say something smart before they forget I exist!
[Slow] [Sad] Maybe I'm just not interesting enough anymore, I dunno, maybe I never was.
[Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, let's all make plans while I'm sitting right here—I totally love finding out secondhand.
[Whisper] [Disappointed] I've been raising my hand for like ten minutes but everyone just... looks right through me.
[Angry] You know what? I'm done trying to—actually, why do I even bother? [Tsk] [Sigh]
[Happy] [Fast] Someone laughed at my joke! Did you hear that? They actually heard me say something!
[Slow] It's kinda like being at your own funeral, except, uh, less people care that you're there. [Sad]
[Sarcastic] [Laugh] I should start charging admission for my amazing invisible woman act—it's apparently very convincing!
[Disappointed] [Slow] I used to fight for attention but honestly? I'm just... I'm too tired to keep trying anymore.
[Shout] [Angry] I EXIST! I have thoughts and feelings and—and why am I even yelling, nobody's listening anyway.
[Whisper] Maybe if I just, um, slowly fade into the wallpaper, it'll hurt less than pretending I belong here. [Sigh]
Wait wait wait—WHAT? You got—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like, an actual publisher wants to... [Gasp] This is huge! Why are you being so calm about this?
Pemberton—that's like, that's a real publisher! They do all those, um, those literary fiction books with the pretty covers, right? Holy shit, this is actually happening.
You haven't—okay okay, I get it, it's a big decision. But like... this is what you've been working toward for literally years, y'know? What's making you hesitate?
Oh no no no, we're not—we're not doing this. Remember when you let me read that chapter last year? I literally cried. [Softer] Like, actual tears. Your writing is... it's special.
Okay but—I mean, they wouldn't offer you a deal if they didn't believe in the whole thing, right? These people know what they're doing. They see something in you that you're kinda... refusing to see?
Your dad thinks—ugh, of course he does. No offense but like, didn't he also think smartphones were gonna be a fad? Some people just don't... they don't get creative stuff.
[Laugh] Exactly! So maybe—just maybe—he's not the best person to take career advice from? Especially about, y'know, following your actual dreams and stuff.
Okay but it's not really about the money right now, is it? It's like—this is your foot in the door. Your first book! Once you're published, that changes everything. You'll be a real author.
That's—honestly? That's the most normal thing you've said. [Chuckle] Everyone's scared of the big stuff. But you've gotta... I dunno, what's worse? Trying and maybe failing, or always wondering what if?
Right? Like, future you is gonna be so pissed if you don't at least try. And hey—worst case scenario, you've got me to ugly cry over your drafts and tell you you're brilliant, so...
SCENARIO: debating whether to wave back at someone who might not be waving at them
[conspiratorial whisper] Oh sweetie, there you are! [getting louder] Did you hear about your cousin Marcus? [Sharp intake of breath] Three divorces now, and rumor has it the last one involved his secretary and a yacht in Miami.
[dismissively] Oh, Joe would've loved the gossip! [cackling laugh] Speaking of love, when are you bringing someone home? [more insistently] Your mother tells me you're still single, thirty-two and no prospects in sight!
[in a knowing tone] Work, work, work! [tutting sound] That's what your cousin Rebecca said before she eloped with her yoga instructor. [drops to whisper] Forty-three years old and ran off to Bali last Tuesday!
[urgently] Wait, wait, before you go! [hushed excitement] Did you know your father's brother, the one nobody talks about? [dramatic pause] He showed up here with a woman half his age wearing diamonds!
[disappointed] Well, you never know these days. [perking up again] Oh! Your sister's pregnancy! [rapid whisper] Four months along and she hasn't told your grandmother yet because of that incident at Christmas!
[huffily] Fine, be boring then. [softening slightly] How's your apartment? [suspicious tone] Still living in that tiny studio, or did you finally move somewhere respectable like your brother did with his family?
[scandalized gasp] Walking! In the city! [lowering voice dramatically] That reminds me, your old friend from high school, Jennifer? [speeding up] Arrested last month for public intoxication after her book club!
[indignantly] I have it on good authority! [whispering intensely] Her mother told me at pilates. [building excitement] Apparently the whole book club was involved, something about wine and a noise complaint!
[quickly] One more thing! [breathless whisper] Your mother's friend Carol, the one with the cats? [triumphant tone] Dating a man she met at bingo who might be in the witness protection program!
[deflated] You young people never believe anything interesting. [perking up slightly] But mark my words, something's fishy there! [confidentially] He drives a different car every week and pays only in cash!
[apologetically] I'm so sorry to hear that, sir. [professional tone] Let me pull up your account— can you confirm your address is 1847 Maple Drive, unit 3B? [more gently] We absolutely stand behind our 30-day guarantee, and we'll make this right.
[understanding] I see Bradley visited on October 15th at 2:30 PM. [concerned] He noted sealing three entry points near your basement. [thoughtfully] Can you tell me— are you seeing actual mice or just, um, new droppings?
[reassuring] We'll get someone out there immediately, sir. [more firmly] I'm scheduling our senior technician for tomorrow at— would 9 AM work? [quickly] That's Thursday the 22nd, and there'll be no charge under your warranty, code WR-2024.
[confidently] Marcus Thompson will be handling your case, employee ID MT-556. [professionally] He's been with us twelve years, specializes in recurring infestations. [more quietly] Between you and me, he's who we send when— when we really need to solve something.
[calmly] I completely understand your frustration, sir. [sincerely] Marcus will do a full inspection, reference number INS-88924-MT. [more emphatically] We'll also extend your warranty by three months and— and provide complimentary quarterly visits through next June.
[professionally] Thank you for coming in today, Mrs. Chen. [clearing throat] I understand you have some concerns about the—the frequency of calls regarding Emma? [sympathetically] Let's discuss how we can work together on this.
[calmly] I completely understand your frustration, and believe me, we don't make these calls lightly. [more firmly] However, our policy requires us to contact parents when symptoms appear that could indicate illness.
[apologetically] I know it seems excessive, but we're dealing with twenty-two other children here. [quickening pace] One contagious illness can spread like wildfire, parents complain, staff gets sick, and suddenly we're understaffed for weeks.
[thoughtfully] Well, perhaps we could... [pauses] Actually, have you submitted the doctor's note stating she's not contagious? [more hopefully] That would certainly help our assessment process.
[defensive] Of course we read them, Mrs. Chen. [sighs heavily] But our teachers aren't medical professionals—they have to err on the side of caution. [more gently] It's liability, you understand?
[quickly] No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. [reassuringly] Your job is absolutely important. Let me... [thoughtful pause] What if we set up a specific symptom threshold for Emma?
[more enthusiastically] We could document specific symptoms that don't require immediate pickup—like clear runny nose without fever. [speaking faster] I'll personally brief the staff, ensure everyone's on the same page about Emma's situation.
[professionally] Absolutely, I'll draft that today and email it to you. [briskly] We'll require fever over 100.4, persistent vomiting, or obvious contagious symptoms before calling. [reassuring] Sound fair?
[warmly] We love having Emma here too, she's such a bright little one. [more serious] These transition months are hard—kids building immunity, parents adjusting. [softly] We'll figure this out together.
[confidently] We're not that kind of facility, Mrs. Chen. [quickly] I'll have that document ready by end of day, and we'll start the new protocol Monday. [encouragingly] Let's check in next week, see how it's going?
[Fast] Come on, come on, just five more minutes and then—okay, maybe three more minutes. [Groan] Who am I kidding, even one more minute feels impossible right now.
[Happy] Oh my god, I actually, like, I actually did ten push-ups without stopping! [Laugh] That's literally never happened before in my entire life!
[Sarcastic] Sure, yeah, "runner's high" they said, it'll be "amazing" they said. [Tsk] Right now all I'm feeling is, uh, runner's why-did-I-do-this.
[Whisper] Nobody's watching, I could just—no, no, finish the set. [Slow] You promised yourself you'd finish the whole thing today.
[Shout] Let's GO! [Fast] This is it, this is the moment, you're gonna crush this last sprint like it's nothing!
[Disappointed] I mean, I've been at this for, what, three weeks now? [Sigh] And I still can't even touch my toes properly.
[Angry] My legs are literally on fire and this stupid playlist just—ugh, where's the skip button?! [Groan] Everything hurts and the music sucks!
[Slow] Breathe in... hold it... and, um, breathe out. [Happy] Okay, that actually kinda helped a little bit.
[Fast] Gotta keep moving, gotta keep—wait, is that my neighbor? [Whisper] Please don't see me sweating like this, please just keep walking.
[Sad] Everyone else makes this look so, I dunno, effortless? [Sigh] And here I am dying after like five minutes.
[Chuckle] You know what, at least I'm not on the couch eating chips. [Happy] That's gotta count for something, right?
[Angry] Twenty burpees?! [Sarcastic] Oh sure, because nineteen wasn't enough torture already, let's just add one more for fun!
[Slow] Remember why you started this whole—actually, why DID I start this? [Tsk] [Disappointed] Oh right, those jeans that don't fit anymore.
[Happy] The endorphins are kicking in, I think—no wait, that's just, uh, that's just sweat in my eyes. [Laugh] Never mind!
[Whisper] If I just do half the reps really fast, that's basically the same thing as doing all of them slowly, right? [Chuckle]
[Shout] YOU'VE GOT THIS! [Fast] Stop thinking about how much it hurts and just—just zone out and push through!
[Disappointed] I literally used to be able to do this stuff in high school without even trying. [Slow] [Sigh] Getting older is, um, it's honestly brutal.
[Sarcastic] "It gets easier," my personal trainer said. [Angry] Well Karen, when exactly does that magical moment happen?!
[Happy] Okay so, I'm basically drenched and disgusting but, like, I kinda feel amazing? [Chuckle] Is this what accomplishment feels like?
[Sad] Maybe I should just—no, you know what? [Slow] One more set, and if I die, at least I'll die trying, I guess.
SCENARIO: Excited about a new phone, then worried they'll break it, then the case they forgot they ordered arrives
I—okay, how did you even find out about that? Look, I was gonna tell you, I just... I knew you'd react like this and I wanted to find the right time.
Don't do that. Don't—[sigh] I only had one plus one, alright? One. And Marcus is literally dating my cousin now, so there's this whole family thing where—
No no no, we talked about it, yeah, but we never like... officially planned it. You said "wouldn't it be fun" and I said "totally" but that's not—I mean, come on, that's not the same as making actual plans.
That's not—ugh, you're twisting this. Look, I'm sorry you're hurt, okay? I am. But you're acting like I deliberately chose him over you to be mean, which is just... [frustrated laugh] that's not what happened.
What happened is my mom called me last week—last week!—and basically informed me that Marcus needs to come because of some family drama I don't even wanna get into. And I tried to—I literally tried to get a second spot but they said no.
Oh, okay, sure. Tell my mom no. Have you met my mother? She would've—god, she would've made my life hell for months. And honestly? You're being kinda unfair here.
Yeah! Yeah, you are. Because I'm stuck between—look, I'm stuck between disappointing you or dealing with a massive family thing, and either way someone's pissed at me. [scoff] And you're supposed to be my friend, you're supposed to understand.
I'm not bailing! Jesus, it's one wedding. One. And it's not even—I mean, you don't even know the bride that well, so I don't get why this is such a huge deal.
Okay okay, fine. I get that now. But you gotta understand—I didn't know it meant that much to you. You never said. You just assumed I'd know, which isn't... that's not totally fair either.
Don't—come on, don't be like that. Look, I know I messed up, alright? I should've told you sooner, I should've... I dunno, handled it better. But I'm not gonna apologize for dealing with my family's crap the only way I could.
I—yeah, okay, I did. But listen, you weren't eating for like three days straight and I was—I mean, what else was I supposed to do? You wouldn't talk to anyone.
Maybe not, but you were literally passing out in class. Like, actually fainting. And you're gonna sit there and tell me I should've just... what? Watched it happen? [scoff] Come on.
No, you didn't. You really, really didn't. And I'm not—look, I'm not gonna apologize for being worried about you dying or something, okay? That's not happening.
Ruin—okay, that's not... [frustrated laugh] I was trying to help you. You get that, right? Like, I wasn't trying to get you in trouble or whatever you think this was about.
Fine, be sarcastic. But you know what? At least your parents actually know now. At least someone's—I dunno, someone's actually doing something instead of just pretending everything's fine when it's obviously not.
You didn't have to ask! That's—that's what friends do, they look out for each other. And honestly? I'm kinda disappointed that you can't see that. Like, you're more upset about your parents knowing than the fact that I was scared for you.
I know, and I—look, I know I broke that promise, okay? I do. But some promises... I mean, come on, you were asking me to basically watch you hurt yourself. That's not fair either.
That's not—[sigh] okay, if that's how you wanna see it, fine. But I had to choose between keeping a secret and keeping you alive, and I'm not—I'm not gonna feel bad about which one I picked.
Maybe not, but you weren't exactly making great choices yourself, were you? And I'm—look look, I'm sorry it happened this way, I am. But I'm not sorry I told them.
Don't—don't do that. Don't shut me out like this. I know you're mad, and you have every right to be, but I did it because I care about you. That's gotta count for something, doesn't it?
Wait wait wait—WHAT? You're kidding me right now. Which one? The one you applied for like, months ago? I thought you were just—oh my god, this is actually happening?
The dating—okay, okay, I'm gonna need you to like, not be so casual about this because I'm literally freaking out [Laugh] for you right now. When do you leave?
Two MONTHS? That's—wow, that's actually kinda terrifying, right? Like exciting but also... are you nervous? I'd be so nervous. Actually no, I'd be beyond nervous, I'd be like—
Oh. Oh no no no, that's—yeah, that's gonna be a whole conversation. Are they gonna watch? Can you imagine your mom seeing you on TV making out with someone? [Groan]
Sorry, sorry! I'm just—my brain is going like a million miles an hour right now. But honestly? This is huge. You're gonna be famous. Like, people are gonna recognize you at Starbucks and stuff.
Okay but like—even if it doesn't, you still get to go! To wherever they're filming! Is it somewhere good? Please tell me it's somewhere tropical and not like, I dunno, Nebraska or something.
FIJI? Are you—[Gasp] okay I take back everything I said about being nervous. You HAVE to go. This is literally a free vacation where they film you... kissing strangers. Hmm.
No but seriously though, like—this is what you wanted, right? You seemed pretty excited when you first applied. Or are you having second thoughts now that it's... real?
Forty pages of—wait, what kind of stuff? Like, they own your soul forever type contracts or just boring legal whatever?
That's... okay that's actually pretty intense. But you know what? You're gonna be amazing. And if you hate it, at least you tried, y'know? Better than always wondering what if.
What? The one from last night? I thought it was cute! We were having fun and you looked—okay, what's wrong with it exactly?
You don't though! That's—that's what I don't get. You look fine, you look normal, you look like yourself having a good time. I wouldn't have posted it if I thought [scoff] you looked bad.
Are you serious right now? It's been up for like twelve hours, everyone's already seen it. And honestly? I still don't see what the problem is. You're being kinda—I dunno, dramatic about this.
Okay okay, maybe your eyes are a little—but that's just 'cause you were laughing! That's what people look like when they're actually having fun, not posing for some perfect Instagram thing. I mean, come on.
Since when do we—we never ask each other before posting stuff. We literally never do that. Last week you posted that video of me singing karaoke and did you ask? No. But I didn't freak out about it.
How? How was that different? 'Cause from where I'm standing, it's exactly the same thing except you actually looked good in this photo and I looked [frustrated laugh] like a drunk idiot in that video.
I'm not—ugh, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I genuinely, honestly thought you looked great. Like, I wouldn't have posted it if I didn't. I'm not trying to sabotage you or whatever you think this is.
What? No they didn't. Katie said we looked fun, Mark just put fire emojis, and—okay, who said you looked rough? 'Cause I didn't see that at all.
Lauren's always—she's just jealous we didn't invite her. You know how she is. And one passive aggressive comment doesn't mean—look look, if it really bothers you that much, fine, I'll take it down. [sigh] But I still think you're wrong about how you look in it.
I will, okay? I'm gonna do it right now. But I'm also kinda—y'know what, never mind. It's fine. I'll delete it. But next time maybe tell me you wanna approve every photo before I post, since apparently that's what we're doing now.
Wait, what? I—okay, I mentioned you were seeing someone, but I didn't think that was like, a secret secret. You talk about your appointments all the time!
But you never said—look, you literally told me about it at lunch with other people around! How was I supposed to know it was off limits? [frustrated laugh] I'm not a mind reader.
That's—wow, okay. That's kinda harsh. I mean, you tell me everything and I'm supposed to just guess which things are private? You gotta communicate that stuff.
Yes, you should! Come on, that's not—you can't just assume I know what's okay to share and what's not. Especially when you're so open about it with me. That's literally not fair.
I'm not saying—[sigh] no, that's not what I'm saying. I'm sorry it got out, I am. But you're acting like I deliberately betrayed you when I honestly, honestly didn't know.
Maybe, yeah, but—okay okay, in hindsight, sure. But we share stuff about each other all the time! Remember when you told Jake about my promotion before I could? I didn't flip out on you.
How? How is that different? It's—no, seriously, explain to me how that's different. Because from where I'm standing, it seems pretty similar, except I didn't make you feel like garbage about it.
Fine, you're right, it's not the same thing. But I'm just—I dunno, I'm frustrated that you won't even consider that this was an honest mistake. Like, do you really think I'd hurt you on purpose?
It does though! Intent matters—it has to matter. [scoff] I've been your friend for six years and you're ready to throw that away because I didn't realize something was a secret when you never told me?
Yeah, fine. Take your time. But just—I hope you remember all the secrets I have kept for you. Because there's been a lot, and I never once threw those in your face.
SCENARIO: waiting for glue to set
[broken voice] We promised them freedom, Mikhail. [Choking sob] We swore on our mothers' graves that this would be different—that we'd build something beautiful. [quieter] Look at it burn... everything we fought for is just ash now.
[trembling whisper] Do you remember that first meeting in the cellar? [stronger] We were so certain, so pure in our conviction! [Gasping breath] Now I can't even recognize what we've become—murderers dressed as liberators.
[desperately fast] Maybe if we'd been more patient, more careful with the transition— [Sob] No, who am I fooling? [defeated whisper] The revolution devoured itself the moment we picked up those first rifles.
[quivering] My sister died believing we'd create paradise. [more firmly] She bled out on these very stones, smiling, whispering about the future. [Shuddering breath] What do I tell her children when they ask why she's gone?
[shouting] It wasn't supposed to end like this! [quieter each word] The philosophy, the ideals, the brotherhood of man... [trailing off] When did we trade our dreams for blood? When did justice become just revenge?
[pleading] There must be something we can salvage, some seed of good in all this ruin. [more desperate] Please, tell me those deaths meant something—that history will remember us as more than butchers!
[in wonder] Look how beautifully it burns though. [horrified realization] God, what's wrong with me? [Strangled sob] I'm admiring the aesthetics of our failure while innocent people are probably still trapped inside those flames.
[whispering] Do you think they'll forgive us? [louder] The next generation, I mean—when they see these ruins. [Shaky breath] Or will they curse our names every time they walk past these blackened stones?
[suddenly urgent] We should leave—tonight—before the loyalists regroup. [quieter, resigned] Though where would we go? [Bitter laugh] What nation would harbor architects of such magnificent disaster? We're prisoners of our own making.
[through tears] Hold my hand? [more steadily] If we're going to watch our dreams turn to ash, I don't want to do it alone. [Sob] Strange how the revolution gave us brotherhood only in its failure.
[apologetic] Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about this delay, let me pull up Marcus's file right away. [reassuringly] Can you verify the address we have on file—is it still 2847 Oak Ridge Drive?
[concerned] I see the case number here, and you're absolutely right, this shouldn't have taken this long. [professionally] The evaluation request shows it was received September 14th, but somehow got stuck in processing—[quickly] I'm escalating this immediately.
[empathetically] You're absolutely right about the timeline, and I can't imagine how difficult this has been. [more firmly] I'm putting you directly through to our Special Services Coordinator, Dr. Williams—[helpfully] she can schedule an emergency evaluation within 5 business days.
[confidently] I'm documenting everything right now and sending that confirmation email as we speak. [clearly] Dr. Williams has an opening this Thursday, November 2nd at 10:30 AM—[checking] Can you come to the district office at 1500 Education Boulevard?
[determinedly] It won't be postponed, I'm personally guaranteeing that and putting priority code P1-URGENT on Marcus's file. [sincerely] You'll receive confirmation text to 555-0147 within the hour, [warmly] and I genuinely apologize for everything your family has experienced.
[understanding] Of course, and that's exactly what should have happened months ago. [informatively] Dr. Williams will review all your documentation at Thursday's meeting—[encouragingly] bring any teacher observations or work samples you think would help the evaluation.
[enthusiastically] Yes, absolutely bring Dr. Kumar's letter, that medical documentation is incredibly helpful! [efficiently] I'm adding a note to your file about that right now—[helpfully] also updating your contact preference to email and text, is that correct?
[compassionately] Please don't apologize, your frustration is completely justified and your advocacy for Marcus is admirable. [reassuringly] After Thursday's evaluation, the full IEP team meeting will happen within 15 days—[precisely] that's November 17th at the latest.
[confidently] Dr. Williams herself will conduct the evaluation, I have her confirmation right here on my screen. [supportively] She specializes in learning differences for elementary students—[informatively] she's actually won three state awards for her innovative support programs.
[warmly] Perfect, and I'll be here if you need anything before then—ask for Janet, extension 4421. [encouragingly] Marcus is lucky to have such a dedicated advocate—[sincerely] we'll make sure he gets every resource he needs to succeed.
[professionally] Good morning, this is Sarah from SolarBright Solutions. [quickly] I'm calling regarding your installation scheduled for—um—last Tuesday. [apologetically] Unfortunately, we've encountered some delays with the permitting process.
[sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [more quickly] The city inspector flagged an issue with the electrical panel documentation, so we need to—well—resubmit everything. [reassuringly] Should only be another week or two.
[defensively] Sir, I assure you we're doing everything possible to expedite this. [briskly] Our team is working directly with the permit office daily—sometimes twice daily. [more gently] These municipal delays are beyond our control.
[quickly] Of course, I can transfer you to my supervisor, but—um—let me first offer you something. [more enthusiastically] We'd like to provide a $500 credit for the inconvenience. [hopefully] Would that help make this situation better?
[hurriedly] Actually, Mr. Johnson, your panels are already at our local facility, ready to go. [more confidently] Once we get the green light—which should be by Friday—we can install within 48 hours. [earnestly] I promise you're our top priority.
[quickly] No, no, please don't do that, Mr. Johnson. [nervously] If we miss Friday, I'll personally—um—escalate this to our regional manager. [more firmly] We'll increase the credit to $750 and guarantee a weekend installation.
[caught off guard] Well, I—we have strong indications from the permit office that— [more smoothly] Look, between you and me, we're 90% sure it'll be approved Thursday. [confidentially] I just can't officially promise that yet.
[apologetically] I'm sorry, I should have been more transparent. [quickly] Company policy prevents us from making guarantees until permits are in hand, but—yes—Thursday looks very likely. [sincerely] I understand why you're upset.
[relieved] Absolutely, I'm typing it up right now. [briskly] Installation by Sunday at the latest, $750 credit, and—um—I'll include my direct line so you can bypass the call center. [hopefully] Does that work for you?
[earnestly] I completely understand, and you have every right to feel that way. [quickly] The email's sent—please confirm you received it. [gratefully] Thank you for your patience, Mr. Johnson, we'll make this right.
[Fast] So, uh, do you know the host or are you just—actually, I don't even know the host that well myself, I kinda got dragged here by my roommate. [Nervous laugh]
[Whisper] Is it just me or is the music, like, aggressively loud? [Tsk] I can barely hear myself think.
[Happy] Oh my god, I love your dress! [Fast] Where did you—sorry, that's probably weird, I just really like fashion.
[Sarcastic] Yeah, I'm having a blast standing by the snack table for twenty minutes. [Sigh] Peak party performance right here.
[Slow] Have you, um, have you tried the spinach dip thing? [Disappointed] It's... interesting.
[Shout] What? [Laugh] Sorry, I literally cannot hear you over this song!
[Sad] I used to be good at this whole mingling thing, but honestly, after lockdown, I'm just—I dunno how to talk to strangers anymore. [Sigh]
[Happy] Wait, you work in marketing too? [Fast] [Chuckle] Small world, I guess—which agency?
[Angry] My friend literally promised she'd be here by nine and it's—what time is it even? [Groan] She always does this.
[Slow] So... [Tsk] come here often? [Laugh] Sorry, that was terrible, I'm really bad at this.
[Whisper] Do you know if there's, like, a bathroom upstairs or—? [Fast] I've been wandering around for ten minutes looking.
[Disappointed] I thought this was gonna be more of a casual thing, but everyone's so dressed up and I'm just in jeans. [Sigh] [Slow] Story of my life.
[Happy] Your dog videos on Instagram are literally the only reason I survived Monday! [Laugh] [Fast] Sorry, that sounded less creepy in my head.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, I always discuss cryptocurrency with random people at parties. [Tsk] It's, uh, it's my favorite topic.
[Shout] [Angry] Can someone please tell Brad to stop monopolizing the aux cord? [Groan] Nobody wants to hear his DJ mixtape!
[Slow] I'm trying this thing where I say yes to more invitations, but honestly—[Sad] [Sigh] I kinda just wanna go home and watch Netflix.
[Fast] Quick question: is it weird that I've been pretending to text for the last five minutes? [Chuckle] [Whisper] Because I definitely have been.
[Happy] No way, you're from Portland? [Fast] I went to Reed for like two years before I—well, before I dropped out, actually. [Laugh]
[Disappointed] The invite said "light refreshments" but I thought that meant, y'know, actual food? [Tsk] [Slow] These three crackers aren't really cutting it.
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Yeah, I'm totally the person who shows up alone to parties where I know nobody—it's kinda my thing. [Sigh] Living the dream.
SCENARIO: Frustrated about a gym membership charge, then remembers they never actually canceled it
Wait wait wait—what thing? What are you—oh my god, the photography competition? The one with like, all those professional judges?
Are you kidding me right now? That's—that's actually incredible! I mean, I knew you were good but like... [Gasp] first place? Out of how many people?
Two hundred—okay no, you cannot just drop that on me so casually! This is huge! Like, this is literally life-changing huge, y'know?
Just a—are you seriously gonna downplay this? Because um, I saw the other entries online and they were like, really really good. Yours must've been absolutely stunning.
Oh my god, stop stop stop—it wasn't luck! You've been out there every single weekend at like, what, 5 AM? Taking hundreds of shots? [Laugh] That's not luck, that's dedication.
You guess? Okay, what did—what did they say about your piece? The judges? They must've given you feedback or something, right?
Whatever that—babe, that's literally the highest praise you can get! That means you didn't just take a pretty picture, you like... you made art. Real art.
Five thou—[Chuckle] okay now you're just showing off! What are you gonna do with it? Finally get that new lens you've been obsessing over?
That's so—ugh, that's so you. But honestly? You should celebrate a little. Like, this is the kind of thing people dream about and you actually did it, y'know?
Um, yes? Obviously yes! We're gonna—we're getting the fancy place downtown and you're gonna tell me everything, every single detail about how it felt to win. No arguing!
Wait wait wait—WHAT? You're—oh my god, you're engaged? Like, actually engaged engaged? When did this even happen?
Stop it right now, that's—that's so perfect though! The place with the little candles and the— [Gasp] wait, did they do it during dessert? Please tell me there was tiramisu involved.
IN the tiramisu? That's like—okay that's actually kinda risky but also really cute? I'm literally dying right now. How are you so calm about this?
No no no, that's—that's totally normal. It's huge, y'know? Like after what, five years? Six years? You guys have been together forever.
Seven years and you're just now— [Laugh] sorry, I mean, that's not bad! That's like, you really know each other, right? Some people get engaged after like six months which is insane.
And are you? Sure, I mean? Like—actually wait, that's a dumb question, you said yes so obviously you're—but like, how do you feel?
Oh babe, that's so—honestly? That sounds exactly right. Like if you weren't a little scared I'd be worried. This is literally your whole life changing.
Of course she did, oh my god. Is she going full—what's it called—bridezilla but for moms? Momzilla? [Chuckle] That's gonna be a whole thing, isn't it?
THREE YEARS? She's been—okay that's actually hilarious but also terrifying? Like she was just waiting, just ready to pounce with her little color swatches and stuff.
Hey, you know what though? You don't have to—like, this is your thing, okay? Yours and your partner's. Your mom can have opinions but she doesn't get to, y'know, take over. You excited though? Even a little?
SCENARIO: waiting for someone to text back
[defensively] Eight percent is perfectly reasonable for mediocre service. [getting louder] She forgot my water twice and mixed up our appetizers! [Scoff] I'm not subsidizing incompetence just because society expects me to throw money around like confetti.
[smugly] Normal people don't understand economics. [slower pace] If everyone tipped properly based on actual service quality, [triumphantly] maybe these restaurants would train their staff better instead of expecting customers to supplement their payroll expenses.
[dismissively] That's emotional manipulation, not my problem. [matter-of-fact] Her financial planning isn't my responsibility. [Dry chuckle] Besides, I left her five whole dollars on a sixty-dollar check—that's generous enough for forgetting my ranch dressing.
[condescendingly slow] The wine was an investment in our evening's enjoyment. [sharply] Tips are optional gratuities, hence the name. [Snort] If she wanted guaranteed income, she should've chosen a career with a proper salary structure, shouldn't she?
[mockingly] Oh, how dramatic! [in disbelief] You're ending our friendship over tipping culture? [Hollow laugh] Fine, go ahead and enable this broken system where customers are guilted into paying employees instead of their actual employers doing it.
[indignantly] Humiliate? [rising pitch] I'm the one being humiliated by your virtue signaling! [Harsh laugh] Go ahead, waste your money if it makes you feel morally superior to everyone who understands basic mathematics and principles.
[defensively fast] My income is irrelevant to this discussion! [slowly, deliberately] A tip should reflect service quality, period. [Sharp intake] Just because I earn well doesn't mean I should subsidize every sob story with a notepad.
[pompously] Concert tickets provide lasting memories and cultural enrichment. [dismissive tone] Overtipping provides nothing but enabling a flawed system. [Clicking tongue] You clearly don't understand the difference between worthwhile investments and throwing money away on principle.
[irritated] Stiffed her? [louder, defensive] I left something, didn't I? [Exasperated huff] In most countries, tipping isn't even expected—America's the only place where customers are emotionally blackmailed into paying restaurant wages directly.
[bitterly] Fine by me! [quick tempo] I'll save money on both the tip and your overpriced entrees. [Sardonic chuckle] Maybe I'll find dining companions who appreciate fiscal responsibility instead of bleeding-heart liberalism at every meal.
[skeptical] Yeah, hi, I'm calling about your, uh, international plans? [pause] My account number is 4-4-7-8-9-2-K-L-M. [suspiciously] I saw online you have something for $45 a month, but that seems way too cheap for unlimited calling.
[doubtfully] Okay, but like, what's the catch here? [more insistently] Every time I've switched plans before, you guys hit me with—I don't know—activation fees, roaming charges. [sighs] Last year's "upgrade" cost me an extra $230 somehow.
[sarcastically] Right, so what about data though? [increasingly frustrated] Because my daughter's studying in Prague—address is 42 Nerudova Street, apartment 3-B—and she's constantly on Instagram. [groans] Don't tell me it's like 50 megabytes or something ridiculous.
[surprised] Wait, fifteen gigs? [cautiously optimistic] That's... actually not terrible. [quickly] But hang on, does this work immediately, or is there some waiting period? Because she leaves Thursday, flight UA-8847 at 2:30 PM.
[hesitantly] It's, um... [pause] actually that card expired. [annoyed] Hold on, let me get the new one—it's 9-0-3-4. [more cooperatively] Look, if this really is $45 flat, no surprises, then yeah, let's do it.
[briskly] Good afternoon, this is Marcus from City Power Solutions, how can I— [pause] oh, I see you're calling about a connection delay. [more gently] Let me pull up your account right away, what's the service address?
[sympathetic] Oh wow, three weeks is definitely not acceptable, I'm so sorry about that. [quickly] Let me just... okay, I'm seeing here that there was a— [confused] wait, this says the technician couldn't access the building?
[defensive] Right, well, sometimes our techs encounter unexpected— [more quickly] actually, you know what, let me escalate this immediately. [firmly] This needs priority handling, especially for a commercial property of this... caliber.
[nervous] Lawyers, okay, yes, let's definitely avoid that route. [speaking faster] I'm flagging this as critical priority right now— executive level escalation. [reassuring] How about we schedule a guaranteed appointment for tomorrow morning?
[quickly] Absolutely, I'm actually putting you directly under his oversight for this case. [more confidently] Tomorrow, 8 AM sharp, and— and if they don't show, the manager himself will personally ensure connection by end of day.
[hastily] Of course, yes, I'm noting all of that in your file right now. [more carefully] We'll be applying a full month credit, plus— let me check what else I can authorize here... [brighter] additional commercial service credits.
[professionally] Yes, Marcus Chen, employee ID 4-4-7-2. [quickly] I'm sending you my direct extension right now, and— and I'll personally monitor this ticket until resolution. [earnestly] This won't happen again, I promise you that.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration completely, and you're right to be upset. [more firmly] Just to confirm— tomorrow, 8 AM, guaranteed connection, or the regional manager handles it personally. [quickly] Is there anything else I can do right now?
[quickly] Absolutely, I'll compile that report and have it sent within twenty-four hours. [pause] It'll include timeline, personnel involved, and— [more confidently] and our corrective action plan going forward. Will email work for you?
[understanding] No, no, I completely get it, this situation is unacceptable on every level. [speaking faster] You've been more than patient, and we've clearly dropped the ball here. [firmly] But I give you my word, this ends tomorrow morning.
[Disappointed] So I guess, uh, everyone already knows then? [Sigh] This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
[Fast] Wait wait wait, how did you—actually, it doesn't matter, I just need to know who else knows about this. [Groan]
[Sarcastic] Oh fantastic, the one time a rumor about me is actually true. [Tsk] Of all the things to get right.
[Whisper] Can we, um, can we maybe not talk about this here? [Slow] People are literally staring at us right now.
[Happy] You know what? I'm kinda relieved it's finally out there—I mean, keeping it secret was exhausting anyway. [Laugh]
[Angry] I specifically told Rachel not to say anything and she just—ugh! [Shout] This is such a betrayal!
[Sad] Yeah, it's, uh, it's true. [Slow] I didn't want you to find out like this though, honestly.
[Chuckle] The funny thing is, like, the rumor isn't even the worst part—wait till you hear the whole story. [Fast] It gets so much weirder.
[Disappointed] I was gonna tell everyone myself, y'know? [Sigh] But I guess that ship has kinda sailed now, hasn't it?
[Shout] How is this anyone's business?! [Angry] I mean, seriously, don't people have their own lives to worry about?
[Slow] Look, technically speaking, um, only part of it is true—the rest is just... [Whisper] okay fine, it's all true.
[Happy] Actually, this is perfect timing because I was literally about to—no, you know what? [Laugh] This saves me the trouble!
[Sarcastic] Great detective work, everyone. [Tsk] Y'all should really consider, like, opening a private investigation firm or something.
[Fast] Okay so basically what happened was—actually, er, how much do you already know? [Disappointed] Everything? Oh.
[Sad] I mean, I tried to deny it for so long that I almost believed it wasn't true myself. [Sigh]
[Whisper] Between you and me though? [Chuckle] The rumor actually makes it sound way cooler than it really was.
[Angry] This is exactly why I don't tell people things—someone always has to go and run their mouth! [Groan]
[Slow] You're not, um, you're not gonna look at me differently now, are you? [Sad] 'Cause that's what I'm really afraid of.
[Happy] Honestly? Keeping this secret was killing me, so like—[Fast] whatever, let everyone talk, I don't even care anymore!
[Sarcastic] Well congratulations to whoever started this rumor, you've got, uh, a real gift for journalism apparently. [Disappointed] [Tsk]
SCENARIO: Upset about being picked last, then being put on the winning team
Oh my god, yes—the one with the weird, like, blue glaze thing? You almost didn't even buy it, right? What about it?
I'm sorry, WHAT? Did you just—did you just say twelve thousand? [Gasp] Like actual dollars? Not like, I dunno, twelve thousand pennies or something?
Hold on, hold on—you're telling me that crusty thing we almost left behind is from the sixteen hundreds? That's like—that's literally older than America. How did you even find out?
Wait wait wait, so you just casually posted it and—boom? People just knew? That's insane. Are you gonna, like, are you actually gonna sell it though?
You have a twelve thousand dollar vase just—just chilling on your counter? Next to like, what, your coffee maker? [Laugh] That's so perfectly you, honestly.
I mean—okay fair, but like, shouldn't it be in a safe or something? What if it falls? Oh god, I'm getting anxious just thinking about it.
That's—okay that's actually a really good point. But still! You could literally pay off your car with that thing, y'know? Or take like, the world's fanciest vacation.
Aww, see? [Chuckle] That's kinda sweet actually. You're gonna get attached to it now, aren't you? Even though it's still ugly as hell.
Oh my god, you're totally not gonna sell it. You're gonna be that person with the priceless artifact that you use as like, a pencil holder or something.
NO. No no no, you did NOT—actually wait, that's honestly iconic. A succulent in a seventeenth century Japanese vase. I can't even—that's so ridiculous I love it.
I know, I know you didn't, but—come on, you were literally talking about maybe dropping out of med school. Was I just supposed to sit there and say nothing?
That's—okay, that's ridiculous. You're my best friend, I'm not gonna just watch you throw your life away without at least—without saying something. [scoff] Sorry for caring, I guess.
I wasn't trying to fix anything! I was just—look, you've worked so hard for this, for years, and hearing you talk like that, it scared me, okay? Maybe I didn't handle it perfectly but I was worried.
It wasn't a lecture, it was—fine, maybe it came out wrong. But honestly, you're acting like I committed some huge crime here. I gave you advice because I care about you, not because I think you're incompetent or whatever.
No, but that's how you're making me feel right now. Like I'm this terrible person for—for what? For not wanting to see you give up on something you've wanted since we were kids? [frustrated laugh] That's really the hill you wanna die on?
I did listen! I listened for like an hour before I said anything. And I'm sorry if the way I—if how I responded wasn't what you needed, but I'm not gonna apologize for being concerned about you.
You're right, you're right, I don't. But you also don't get to just—to dump all this heavy stuff on me and expect me to have zero reaction. That's not fair either. I'm human, y'know?
I am your friend! That's literally why I said something! God, if I didn't care I would've just—I dunno, changed the subject or whatever. But I do care, and maybe that means I overstepped, fine, but don't question whether I'm your friend.
Okay okay, and I—look, I hear you. I do. [sigh] Next time you need to vent, I'll keep my mouth shut. But can you at least understand that it came from a good place? I wasn't trying to control you.
No, they don't. But they should at least—I mean, they should count for something, right? We've been friends for eight years. One mistake where I was genuinely trying to help shouldn't just... erase all that.
SCENARIO: trying to remember someone's name before they get closer
[devastated] My life is completely over! [voice breaking] The coffee shop ran out of oat milk, and I had to use regular milk in my latte. [wailing] How am I supposed to function today with dairy destroying my entire digestive system?
[dramatically gasping] That was different! [whimpering] Pizza cheese doesn't count because it's... it's comfort food! [building hysteria] But coffee is sacred, and now my whole morning routine is ruined forever and I'll probably die!
[trembling whisper] You don't understand the psychological damage! [getting louder] I specifically chose that coffee shop because they respect dietary preferences! [shouting] This betrayal cuts deeper than when Jennifer stole my parking spot last Tuesday!
[defensive shriek] Details! [quieter, sulking] The point is that everything is against me today. [building drama again] First the milk catastrophe, then I broke a nail, and now you're being completely heartless about my suffering!
[sobbing dramatically] See? [hiccupping] This is exactly why I can't share my feelings with you! [accusatory] When YOUR favorite pen ran out of ink, I was there for you! I listened! I cared!
[wounded gasp] How can you put a price on emotional trauma? [pleading] My grandmother gave me these nails! [softer, manipulative] Well, she gave me the DNA that grows them, which is basically the same thing!
[indignant squeal] They're gel, not acrylic! [huffing] And it was twenty dollars! [dejected moan] But fine, minimize my pain. When I'm hospitalized for calcium deficiency from avoiding dairy forever, don't come visit me!
[mysteriously] You know what? [building suspense] I might be! [dramatic revelation] Maybe I'm developing multiple food sensitivities because of the stress you're causing me right now with your complete lack of empathy!
[fake cheerful] Fine! [bitterly] I'll just suffer alone! [melodramatic whisper] Like I always do, carrying the weight of this cruel, dairy-filled world on my lactose-intolerant shoulders while everyone else lives in ignorant bliss!
[immediately sympathetic] Oh my god, your rent went up? [excited squeal] Why didn't you say something? [rapidly] We should totally move in together and split the cost! Think of all the money we'd save!
[defensive] I left you a voicemail on 555-0892 about the emergency pipe inspection. [more firmly] The water damage from unit 4B was spreading and [clears throat] I couldn't wait for your response when property damage was imminent.
[dismissive tone] That's completely unrelated to yesterday's entry. [sighs heavily] Look, according to lease agreement section 7.4.2, I have the right to [more assertively] enter for emergencies without prior notice, period.
[condescending] You can file whatever you want with whoever you want. [chuckles dryly] But remember, your lease expires on 03/31/2024 and [more threateningly] I'll be conducting thorough move-out inspections for that $2,400 security deposit.
[backpedaling slightly] Nobody's threatening anyone here, okay? [nervous laugh] I'm simply stating that per addendum 2A of your lease, [more defensively] routine inspections are perfectly legal with proper protocols followed.
[exasperated sigh] Fine, I'll credit your December rent by $150 for the inconvenience. [more quietly] Can we just... put this behind us and [resigned] move forward like reasonable adults here?
[briskly] Tax office, how can I help you today? [more quickly] We're experiencing high call volumes, so I'll need to be brief with—uh—with each inquiry.
[efficiently] Right, let me pull up your account. [faster] Social security number, please? And while you're at it, which forms have you already submitted this quarter?
[sympathetically] I understand your frustration, sir. [more briskly] Let's start simple—are you self-employed, an independent contractor, or do you have employees under you?
[quickly] That means you'll need both Schedule C for your business income and 1099s for any freelancer you paid over $600. [more firmly] Did you keep records of those payments?
[reassuringly] Okay, breathe. [rapidly] You'll need payment dates, amounts, and their tax ID numbers—we can work backward from your bank statements if necessary. [helpfully] Have you registered for an EIN yet?
[patiently] An Employer Identification Number—think of it as a social security number for your business. [more quickly] You'll need it for the 1099s, and you can apply online; it takes about fifteen minutes.
[briskly] IRS dot gov slash EIN, all capitals. [faster] Once you have that, the 1099 filing becomes much simpler—you'll just input the freelancer info and amounts. [efficiently] Deadline is January 31st, by the way.
[calmly] Sir, extensions are available if needed. [more reassuringly] Though honestly, with your bank statements and a few emails, we're talking maybe—uh—maybe three hours of work total. [encouragingly] You're overthinking this.
[apologetically] We can't prepare your taxes for you, but we do have volunteer assistance programs. [quickly] VITA sites offer free help if your income is under $60,000—there's probably one at your local library.
[confidently] They're trained volunteers who handle exactly these situations. [briskly] They'll sit with you, go through everything step by step, and file electronically. [firmly] Much better than struggling alone, trust me.
[Nervous] Um, sorry, I'm still trying to figure out where the—wait, is this the break room or the conference room? [Laugh] Everything looks the same here.
[Happy] [Fast] Oh my god, everyone's been so nice, like, seriously, I was expecting the whole awkward new person thing but y'all are amazing!
[Whisper] I literally have no idea what half these acronyms mean—QBRM? [Tsk] [Sigh] I'm just nodding along pretending I get it.
[Disappointed] [Slow] I thought I'd have, you know, more time to settle in before they threw me into this huge project.
[Sarcastic] Oh great, another password to remember—because the twelve I created this morning weren't enough, right? [Groan]
[Sad] I keep, uh, I keep forgetting people's names and it's been three days already. [Sigh] I feel like such an idiot.
[Angry] [Fast] Nobody told me about the unassigned seating drama and I've apparently been sitting in Karen's spot for two days straight!
[Happy] [Chuckle] Wait, we get free snacks AND coffee? This place is basically paradise compared to my last job!
[Whisper] [Fast] Quick question—is it normal for the boss to just lurk behind people's desks like that or should I be worried?
[Slow] So I'm supposed to—actually, let me make sure I understand this correctly before I mess something up. [Tsk]
[Shout] Did someone say there's cake in the kitchen?! [Laugh] [Happy] Sorry, still learning appropriate volume levels for this office!
[Disappointed] I mean, I thought "casual Friday" meant, like, actually casual, not "business casual but slightly less business." [Sigh] [Slow] My jeans feel very wrong right now.
[Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Sure, just throw me into the client meeting on day two—what could possibly go wrong, right?
[Sad] [Whisper] Everyone already has their little groups and inside jokes and I'm just... here, eating lunch alone again.
[Happy] You know what, I actually think I'm getting the hang of this whole—oh wait, that's not how you use the copier? [Groan]
[Angry] [Fast] The parking situation is absolutely insane—I've been driving around for twenty minutes and there's literally nowhere to park!
[Slow] [Disappointed] Honestly, the job description was, um, it was kinda different from what I'm actually doing here.
[Chuckle] I've said "sounds good" and "absolutely" to things I definitely don't understand at least fifteen times today. [Sarcastic] Fake it till you make it, right?
[Whisper] [Sad] I miss my old desk where I knew where everything was and didn't have to ask permission to adjust the chair height.
[Happy] [Shout] I got my first email that wasn't IT setup or HR paperwork! [Laugh] I'm officially part of the team now!
SCENARIO: Mad about a missed call, then they text the information instead
Wait wait wait—are you serious? The whole thing? Like the full amount you were asking for? Oh my god, I'm literally—this is huge!
This morning?! And you're just now telling me? I would've been like, screaming from the rooftops or something. How much did you end up with?
Thirty-seven thou— [Gasp] okay that's actually insane. That's like, that's real money. People really believe in this thing you're doing, y'know? How do you even feel right now?
Oh babe, no no no—I mean, I get it, I totally get it. It's like, now it's real, right? Now you actually have to, um, deliver on everything?
Okay but like—hold on though. These people didn't just randomly throw money at you. They saw your vision, they saw what you're capable of, and they were like "yes, this, we want this." That means something.
Have you told your parents yet? Because your mom is gonna absolutely lose it—in like, the best way possible [Chuckle]. She's been telling literally everyone about your project.
That's—yeah, that's fair actually. Take your time. But um, can we at least celebrate a little? Like even just... I dunno, drinks or something? This is massive!
See, this is why—this is exactly why people trust you with their money. You're already thinking about them, about doing right by them. That's so... you're gonna be fine, honestly.
Three hundred and—wait, that's like a whole community! That's basically a small town of people who believe in what you're doing! [Sigh] Sorry, I'm being super intense, I'm just really proud of you.
I know, I know it is. But hey—you don't have to figure it all out today, y'know? Just like, let yourself have this moment. You did something really hard and it worked.
SCENARIO: realizing they've been on mute during a video call
[nervous laugh] Hi there, Maya! We're so happy to finally meet you. [speaking quickly] We've been preparing your room for weeks—painted it purple because the social worker mentioned you liked that color. [quieter] Is purple still okay?
[gentle voice] That must have been really hard, moving around so much. [steadier] We're not going anywhere, Maya. [soft exhale] This is our first time too, actually—being parents, I mean. We're probably more scared than you are.
[hurt whisper] We're not like that. [stronger] My husband and I waited three years for this moment. [voice breaking] We chose you, Maya, specifically you—not just any child. [steadying breath] We read every word of your file twice.
[calmly] It mentioned you love astronomy and taught yourself guitar. [warmer tone] That you read fantasy novels under your blanket with a flashlight. [excited whisper] We actually bought a telescope—it's in the garage if you want to see it later.
[firmly] The telescope is already yours, no matter what. [shaky breath] And there's a guitar in your room too. [more confidently] We know trust takes time, Maya. [gentle] We're prepared to wait as long as you need.
[reassuring tone] My husband has nightmares too, from his time overseas. [matter-of-fact] We installed soundproofing last month anyway—for music practice. [soft chuckle] And vegetables? [whispering conspiratorially] I hide mine under mashed potatoes. Don't tell David.
[laughing warmly] David? Strict? [amused tone] He cried watching Moana last week and lets the dog sleep on our bed. [tender voice] The only rule he's firm about is Sunday pancakes. [playful whisper] Chocolate chip ones.
[enthusiastic] A golden retriever named Biscuit! [getting faster] She's probably hiding behind David's legs right now—she's shy with new people. [warm laugh] But once she knows you, she'll never leave your side. [softly] She's a cuddler.
[deep breath] We can't have biological children. [steady voice] But Maya, you're not broken—you're brave. [emotional] You've survived things that would destroy adults. [firmly] We didn't pick you because we had no choice. We picked you because you're you.
[soft voice] Then we'll still be here. [more firmly] Slamming doors, testing boundaries—that's what kids do. [slight tremor] We signed up for all of it, Maya. [determined] The hard days, the good days, and everything between them.
[calmly] Sir, I understand your frustration, but the system's showing your coverage terminated on November 30th. [apologetically] Have you recently changed jobs or, um, updated your plan? [sighs] Sometimes there's a lag in—
[more firmly] Sir, I'm trying to help you here. [steadily] Let me call your insurance directly—what's your date of birth and the group number? [professional tone] It should be right under your member ID, starts with GRP or something similar.
[sighs deeply] I'm seeing here that your pharmacy benefit manager changed to CareMark as of December first. [patiently] Your medical is still BlueCross, but prescriptions now need the new BIN number—610494. [more softly] Did you receive a separate pharmacy card?
[sympathetically] I completely understand, and we'll figure this out. [reassuringly] For now, the cash price is forty-two dollars and ninety cents. [quickly] Or I can try running it under discount code RX2024SAVE for thirty-one fifty?
[apologetically] Unfortunately, we can't post-date insurance claims, but here's what I can do. [helpfully] Call 1-800-CAREMARK right now, get your PCN and group numbers. [encouragingly] I'll hold your prescription, and you can come back before we close at nine.
[gently] I know it's frustrating, trust me. [more warmly] Tell them you need your new ID number that starts with 'W' followed by nine digits. [confidently] Once you have that, we can process everything in about two minutes, promise.
[relieved] Okay, so that's forty-two ninety for the Metformin. [hesitantly] But sir, weren't you also picking up your Lisinopril and, um, the Atorvastatin? [concerned] Those would be another seventy-eight dollars without insurance.
[thoughtfully] Wait, let me check something... [hopefully] Are you by any chance eligible for Medicare Part D? [quickly] Because if you're over sixty-five, we might have other options through our senior discount program.
[professionally] Alright, forty-two ninety for just the Metformin then. [sympathetically] I'll put notes in your file about the insurance issue, okay? [helpfully] Also, here's CareMark's provider line—1-800-966-5772—sometimes it's faster than customer service.
[encouragingly] Hopefully with the right numbers, it'll be much smoother tomorrow. [warmly] I'll be here until five if you need help after calling them. [cheerfully] Your receipt's in the bag, and, uh, good luck with CareMark!
[briskly] Next customer, please! [cheerfully] Hi there, how can I help you today? Returns are right here at this counter.
[quickly] Alright, let me pull up your receipt in the system. [more cautiously] I do see here that unopened appliances have a fifteen percent restocking fee. Will that be okay?
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, really. [speaking faster] The fee covers processing and inspection costs—it's printed on the receipt and posted at checkout, but [more gently] I know it's easy to miss.
[sympathetically] Let me check with my manager real quick. [more optimistically] Since you're a rewards member and it's unopened, maybe—just maybe—we can work something out for you.
[brightly] Good news! [speaking rapidly] My manager approved a one-time courtesy waiver, so you'll get the full refund. Just need your signature here and we're all set.
[Sad] I messed up, and um, there's nothing I can say to justify it—I just, I'm truly sorry. [Sigh]
[Fast] [Disappointed] Look, I know I hurt you, okay, and I gotta own that completely, no matter what was going on with me.
[Whisper] You deserved so much better from me. [Slow] [Sad] I... I failed you.
[Angry] I'm furious at myself for this—like, genuinely furious—and you have every right to be too. [Tsk]
[Slow] What I did was wrong, period. [Sigh] [Disappointed] Full stop, y'know?
[Chuckle] [Sarcastic] Yeah, I really outdid myself this time, didn't I? But seriously, I'm—I'm genuinely sorry.
[Fast] Can I just—actually, no, let me start with this: I apologize, completely and without any buts attached. [Sad]
[Happy] You know what? I'm gonna make this right, I promise—well, first I need to apologize properly. [Fast] I'm sorry.
[Shout] I screwed up! [Slow] [Sad] There, I said it, and I mean it.
[Disappointed] This isn't who I wanna be, and uh, seeing your face right now, I just—I'm so sorry. [Sigh]
[Slow] I've been thinking about what I did, and honestly? [Tsk] [Angry] I don't even recognize myself in that moment.
[Whisper] [Sad] I'm sorry doesn't feel like enough, but it's... it's all I've got right now.
[Sarcastic] Oh great, now I'm the person who—no, wait, I'm not gonna deflect. [Sad] [Slow] I apologize, sincerely.
[Fast] [Happy] Okay so I've been rehearsing this all day but basically—I was wrong, you were right, I'm sorry!
[Groan] I keep replaying it in my head and I just... [Disappointed] [Slow] I wish I could take it back, y'know?
[Angry] [Fast] The worst part is I knew better—I literally knew better—and I still did it anyway! I'm sorry.
[Sad] How do I even—I mean, where do I start with apologizing for something like this? [Whisper] I'm just... sorry.
[Laugh] [Disappointed] I can't believe I'm that person who—ugh, never mind what kind of person, I just need to apologize.
[Slow] You trusted me. [Sad] [Sigh] And I, um, I broke that trust completely.
[Fast] [Chuckle] I've written like seventeen apology texts and deleted them all 'cause—actually, I needed to say this in person: I'm sorry.
