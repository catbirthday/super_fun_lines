What? That's—no, that's not even true. I'm still me, I just... look, you don't get what it's like having to navigate different spaces, okay?
Okay okay, so I code switch, big deal. [scoff] Like you've never adjusted how you talk to your grandma versus your friends. It's the same thing.
How is it not? I'm just—I'm trying to fit in both places, y'know? It's exhausting actually, having to constantly think about how I'm coming across to everyone.
Wow. That's—that's really unfair. You're acting like I'm being fake or something when I'm literally just trying to survive in different environments. You wouldn't understand.
Fine, you wanna know? When I'm with them, if I talk like I normally do with you, they look at me like I'm—like I don't belong. [frustrated laugh] And when I'm with you apparently I'm what, a sellout?
You didn't have to. Your face kinda said it all back there. And honestly? I'm getting pretty tired of feeling like I gotta apologize for knowing how to adapt.
Told you what exactly? Hey, heads up, I sound different around my other friends? I didn't think I needed to like, warn you about—[sigh]—I didn't think you'd judge me for it.
Both. Both are me, okay? That's the whole—that's literally the point. I'm not pretending, I'm just... different parts of me come out in different places. Why is that so hard to accept?
You do know me! God, you're being so—you do. But knowing me also means understanding that I've gotta move through the world differently than you do sometimes.
Seriously? That's—okay, you know what, I'm done trying to explain this. When you actually wanna listen instead of making me feel guilty for existing in multiple spaces, let me know.
I know, I know—look, I've been meaning to text you back, but things have been absolutely insane with work and my mom's surgery and I just—[sigh] I haven't had a second to breathe, okay?
Don't—don't do that. Don't act like I'm making excuses. You know what I've been dealing with. I'm literally working sixty hour weeks and trying to help my parents and I can barely keep my own life together.
And I'm sorry, I am, but like—what do you want me to do? Clone myself? I'm drowning here and you're mad because I missed a couple hangouts? That's not—come on, that's not fair.
That's—okay okay, fine, but you're acting like I'm doing this to hurt you. [frustrated laugh] Like I wake up and think "how can I blow off my friend today?" That's not what's happening and you know it.
Seriously? We've been friends for eight years and you're gonna—wow. Okay. I mean, I guess if that's what you really think of me then maybe we have bigger problems here.
Look, I get that you're hurt, alright? I do. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you can't see I'm barely keeping my head above water here. Like, I'm not choosing work over you, I'm choosing paying rent and keeping my job.
Yeah, because that's—that's life? I dunno what to tell you. [scoff] Things pile up sometimes and I can't just drop everything because you wanna grab drinks or whatever.
I—shit. Okay, that's... I didn't forget, I just—everything's been such a blur and I meant to check in but then another crisis would happen and... I'm sorry about that. Really.
No no no, don't—don't "sure" me. I am sorry about your dad, genuinely. But you're also not acknowledging that I've been going through hell too. It's like my problems don't even matter to you.
That's not—[groan] fine. Fine. If you wanna make me the villain here, go ahead. But I'm not gonna apologize for trying to survive. I'm doing my best, and if that's not enough for you then I dunno what else to say.
Oh. Oh no, okay—I know what you're gonna say and you're—you're totally right. I've been really weird lately, haven't I? Like one day I'm all in and the next I just... disappear.
I don't mean to! I swear I don't, it's just—sometimes I get really overwhelmed, y'know? And then I kinda shut down and I—wait, that's not an excuse, I'm not trying to make excuses here.
No no no, that's not—[nervous laugh] okay, I'm explaining this badly. Um, basically what happens is I get really excited to hang out and then my brain just... does this thing where I panic? And I bail. Which is awful, I know.
God, I—yeah. Yeah, that must be really frustrating. I wouldn't wanna be friends with me either, honestly. Like who wants a friend who's basically a human coin flip, right? [sigh] I'm really messing this friendship up.
I know, I know. And you've been so patient with me—like, way more patient than I deserve, probably. I just... I dunno how to be consistent? That sounds so stupid when I say it out loud.
You're right. You're—you're absolutely right and I hate that I've been hurting you. That's literally the last thing I ever wanted to do. I care about you so much and I'm just... terrible at showing it consistently, apparently.
Wait wait wait, please don't—I mean, I get it if you need space or whatever but can we—can I try to fix this? I wanna be better. I really, really wanna be the friend you deserve.
I know, but—okay, this time I actually have a plan? Like, I started seeing someone about my anxiety stuff and we're working on it. The whole withdrawal thing, it's—it's apparently a pattern I do when I care too much about something. [quieter] Which is backwards, I know.
Yeah, for like... three weeks now? I didn't wanna tell you until I was sure I'd stick with it, but—but I am. Sticking with it, I mean. Because our friendship is worth figuring my shit out for, y'know?
It is. It really is. And I'm—I'm sorry it took me so long to realize how unfair I was being to you. You shouldn't have to guess whether your friend actually wants to be around you. That's—that's basic stuff and I failed at it. But I'm trying now, if that counts for anything.
Oh god, okay—I know you're mad. I can tell you're mad. Um, about the movie thing, right? I just—I really wanted to see that horror film and I know I kinda pushed for it even though you said—
Wait wait wait, that's not—okay yeah, I did pick the sushi place but like, you said you didn't care where we went! You literally said "whatever" so I thought—I mean, I didn't think you actually minded.
That's—[nervous laugh] okay that's fair. That's really fair actually. God, I'm just now realizing how often I do that, aren't I? Like every time we hang out it's basically my whole agenda.
Shit. I'm—I'm so sorry. I honestly didn't even notice I was doing it? That sounds so stupid but I swear I wasn't trying to be selfish, I just get really excited about stuff and then I kinda bulldoze everyone. My sister says the same thing actually.
No no no, that's not—okay wait, actually... remember when you wanted to go bowling? And I said my wrist hurt? [Groan] My wrist was fine. I just—I don't like bowling and I didn't wanna say that.
I know! I know how bad that sounds. I'm literally the worst friend. You must think I'm so—god, you must hate me right now. I wouldn't blame you if you did, honestly.
You're right. You're completely right and I've been such an ass about it. Like, friendship isn't supposed to be one person just—just dragging the other person around to whatever they wanna do. That's not fair to you at all.
I wanna—I mean, can we start over? Not like, our whole friendship but just... next time we hang out, you pick everything. And I mean everything. The movie, the food, even like what time we meet up. I'll just—I'll shut up and go with it.
Yes! Absolutely, I swear. And not just once either—we should take turns, y'know? Like actual turns where I don't manipulate you into picking what I want. [Sigh] I really am sorry. You deserve better than how I've been treating you.
Deal. Total deal. And um, thank you for—for telling me this instead of just ditching me as a friend. I know I probably deserved that but... yeah. Thank you.
I—what? I didn't know you were coming! You literally said yesterday you had that thing with your family, so I figured—I mean, how was I supposed to know?
Okay okay, but I didn't see it until like, right before the show started. My phone was on silent and—look, if you'd told me earlier, obviously I would've saved you something.
Don't—don't do that. [Scoff] You're acting like I deliberately excluded you when you know that's not what happened. I'm sitting here with everyone else who actually confirmed they were coming.
That's not—ugh, you know what I mean. I saved seats for people who told me they'd be here. I can't just hold empty seats all night hoping maybe you'll show up.
And I appreciate that, I do, but you also always know when I'm coming because I—I actually tell you ahead of time. Not like, an hour before. [Frustrated laugh] This isn't fair.
No, not whatever. You're mad at me for not being psychic, basically. Like, I'm sorry you couldn't sit with us, but maybe—I dunno, maybe communicate better next time?
Yeah, seriously. You can't just—you can't spring this on me last minute and then get all cold when it doesn't work out perfectly. That's kinda manipulative, honestly.
I didn't mean—okay, that came out wrong. [Sigh] But I'm frustrated too, y'know? You're making me feel guilty for something that wasn't my fault.
I could've—sure, fine, I could've checked my phone more. But you could've called, or texted earlier, or literally anything besides assuming I'd just magically know you changed your plans.
Look look, I'm—I'm sorry you felt left out, okay? I am. But you gotta understand this wasn't intentional. Can we just—can we move past this? Please?
[sniffling] Can you believe they're already graduating kindergarten? [voice breaking] It feels like yesterday I was teaching her to tie her shoes, and now [shaky exhale] she's reading full sentences and making friends on her own.
[laughing through tears] Mine asked if she could walk to first grade by herself! [higher pitch] By herself! [quieter] I had to explain that six blocks is still too far, even for a kindergarten graduate with a fancy paper certificate.
[bright but watery] The teachers deserve medals, honestly. [more seriously] Ms. Peterson turned my shy little wallflower into this brave girl who [cracking voice] volunteers to read aloud and shares her snacks without being asked anymore.
[dramatically] Stop it, you're making it worse! [snorting laugh] I already used up all the tissues I brought. [more controlled] My husband thinks I'm being ridiculous, but he teared up during the morning drop-off routine today too.
[nostalgic whisper] I still have her first day photo on my phone. [regular voice] That enormous backpack, those pristine shoes that got muddy within ten minutes. [voice rising with emotion] She looked so tiny next to that classroom door back then.
[suddenly urgent] Oh god, they're starting the slideshow! [panicking] Why do they always add that sentimental music? [breaking down] Look at their baby pictures compared to now, I can't handle this emotional manipulation right now, I really can't.
[determined] We should be celebrating this milestone. [less certainly] They're thriving, they're happy, they're ready. [voice dropping] So why does my heart feel like it's being squeezed in a vice? [bitter laugh] Parenthood is just planned heartbreak, isn't it?
[sudden realization] Oh no, they're about to call them up for diplomas! [frantic whisper] Where's my camera? [more urgently] I can't see through these tears, everything's blurry! [calming slightly] Thank god my husband is recording, because I'm absolutely useless right now.
[post-cry exhaustion] I need a drink after this. [laughing weakly] Several drinks, actually. [more animated] Want to grab lunch and properly sob into our wine? [conspiratorial whisper] We can toast to surviving kindergarten and dreading the teenage years together.
[reflective] You know what though? [warming up] We did good. [with growing pride] Look at these incredible little humans we're raising. [steadier voice] They're kind, curious, brave—everything we hoped they'd be at this age and more.
[frustrated] Look, I specifically called you guys three weeks ago about this wine stain at 4521 Maple Drive. [raising voice] Your technician—employee number 7892—promised me it would come out completely, [sarcastically] but here we are, and it's still visible!
[incredulous] Seventy percent? [groans] That's not what I paid $450 for! [more angrily] When I signed contract number 2024-JAN-889, your sales rep guaranteed—and I quote—"complete stain removal or your money back."
[exasperated] This is ridiculous! [more loudly] My neighbor at 4519 Maple had the exact same Merlot spill, and CleanPro got hers out completely! [accusingly] Are you telling me their $300 service is somehow better than yours?
[skeptically] Another treatment? [scoffs] How much is that going to cost me—another four hundred bucks? [bitterly] My warranty number WST-9901-2024 should cover this since your first attempt clearly failed!
[outraged] A hundred seventy-five dollars to fix what you couldn't fix the first time? [chuckles bitterly] That's rich! [demandingly] I want to speak to your supervisor—what's their direct extension, because this is absolutely unacceptable!
[considering] Eighty-five percent, huh? [sighs heavily] And this technician 4455—what makes them so special compared to the kid you sent last time? [suspiciously] Do they actually have some magical wine-removing certification or something?
[reluctantly] Fine, when can this Marcus person come out? [impatiently] I've got my book club here Thursday at 2 PM, and I absolutely cannot have them seeing this stain—especially not Patricia from unit 4B!
[decisively] Wednesday at nine then—but I'm documenting everything this time. [warningly] If this doesn't work, I'm filing complaint number whatever with the Better Business Bureau, [threateningly] and my review on Yelp will be... thorough.
[somewhat appeased] Alright, but I'm holding you to that 85% improvement guarantee—reference RTG-0923, right? [firmly] And I want that discount code SAVE30WINE applied before he even shows up, [cautiously] not some surprise charge on my Visa ending in 4429.
[resigned] No, I suppose not. [sighs] Just... make sure Marcus knows this is a 2019 Château Margaux stain, not some cheap grocery store wine. [hopefully] Maybe that information will help him work his supposed magic better.
[apologetically] Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that! [quickly] Let me pull up your order right away—can you give me your order number? [more reassuringly] We'll definitely get this sorted out for you today.
[briskly] Got it, I see your order here. [concerned] You're absolutely right—those items were marked as picked but... [pause] [more quickly] they're showing as not loaded into your vehicle somehow.
[understanding] I completely understand your frustration—that's really unacceptable. [rapidly] We can either issue you a full refund for those items right now, or [more helpfully] schedule a redelivery within the next two hours.
[confidently] Yes, absolutely—I'm personally flagging this for priority delivery. [quickly] The driver will have just your missing items, nothing else, so [reassuringly] there's no chance of mix-ups this time.
[briskly] Absolutely, I'm processing a fifteen dollar credit to your account right now for the inconvenience. [sympathetically] Plus the redelivery is completely free, and [more quickly] I'm adding a note to your account about these recurring issues.
[quickly] Yes, you'll get a text when they leave the store and another when they're five minutes away. [helpfully] The driver will also call if you don't answer the door within [more reassuringly] two minutes, so you won't miss them.
[apologetically] I hear you, and I'm really sorry we've let you down. [earnestly] We're actually retraining our pickup team this week because [more quietly] we've had similar complaints from other customers too.
[professionally] We take every complaint seriously, but yes, we've identified a pattern. [quickly] Your feedback today will definitely be included in our team meeting tomorrow—[more sincerely] these specific examples really help us improve.
[chuckles softly] I completely understand—mothers-in-law and backup dinners don't mix well. [reassuringly] Your driver, Marcus, just confirmed he's gathering your items now, so [briskly] you should have them within ninety minutes.
[warmly] We really appreciate your patience with us today. [quickly] Your credit's already applied, Marcus is on his way, and [sincerely] we'll do better next time—I promise.
[Sad] Listen, I know it feels like—like your whole world just collapsed, but I promise you, this isn't gonna hurt forever. [Sigh]
[Angry] You know what? They didn't deserve you anyway, and I'm actually—I'm kinda glad they're gone! [Fast] You were way too good for them.
[Whisper] Hey, come here, it's okay to cry, you don't have to, um, hold it all in. [Slow]
[Happy] Remember that time they forgot your birthday? [Laugh] I mean, honestly, good riddance to that mess!
[Disappointed] I really thought they were different, y'know? [Tsk] But people just—they show their true colors eventually, I guess.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, they're gonna realize what they lost in like, what, two weeks? [Chuckle] Watch them come crawling back.
[Slow] This is just, uh, this is just one chapter ending, and I know that sounds cliché but—[Sigh] there's so much more ahead.
[Fast] Okay so we're gonna get ice cream, we're gonna watch terrible movies, and we're just gonna—we're gonna forget this whole thing happened! [Happy]
[Groan] I can't believe they did this over text message, that's just—who even does that anymore? [Angry]
[Sad] You gave them everything and they just—[Slow] I'm so sorry this happened to you, I really am.
[Whisper] Want me to, um, want me to just sit here with you for a while? [Sad] We don't have to talk or anything.
[Disappointed] Three years is a long time, and it's—yeah, it's gonna take time to heal from this. [Sigh] [Slow]
[Sarcastic] Their new person looks like a discount version of you anyway. [Laugh] I mean, seriously, have you seen their Instagram?
[Happy] You know what though? You're free now! [Fast] You can do whatever you want, go wherever, be whoever!
[Angry] [Shout] If I see them at Sarah's party next week, I swear I'm gonna—actually, no, they're not even worth it!
[Chuckle] Remember how they chewed? [Sarcastic] Like a whole cow or something, just—ugh, you're better off, trust me.
[Slow] It's kinda like, um, like losing a part of yourself, isn't it? [Sad] But you'll find that part again, I promise.
[Fast] [Angry] They literally posted a selfie an hour after breaking up with you? Are you—are you kidding me right now?
[Disappointed] I had this whole speech prepared about love and timing, but honestly? [Tsk] Sometimes people just suck, and that's it.
[Happy] Six months from now, you're gonna look back and be like—wait, why was I even crying over them? [Laugh] [Fast] Mark my words!
I know, I know, I'm literally the worst friend ever. I saw them and I was gonna reply—I swear I was gonna reply right away but then my phone died and I just... I dunno, I got distracted?
No no no, that came out wrong. Not distracted like—like you weren't important or anything. [nervous laugh] I mean, you are important! Super important. I just, um, I've been really overwhelmed with work stuff and I kept thinking I'd write back when I had time to give you a proper response, y'know?
Okay that's—that's fair. That's completely fair. I don't... I don't have a good excuse for that one. I basically just suck at texting lately and I—wait, that's not an excuse either. God, I'm really bad at this.
I've been doing this to everyone, honestly. Not just you—though that doesn't make it better! [groan] It probably makes it worse actually. I open messages and then I panic about responding and then suddenly it's been days and I'm too embarrassed to reply.
No! I mean, apparently yes, but—but it's not on purpose! It's like this weird anxiety thing where the longer I wait, the harder it gets to respond, and then I'm stuck in this horrible loop of feeling guilty but also paralyzed? Does that make sense?
Yeah, I guess it doesn't. Um, the thing is—okay, you needed me and I wasn't there. That's what matters, right? Like, whatever weird brain stuff I've got going on doesn't change that I left you hanging when you reached out.
Oh my god. Oh my god, are you—are you serious? [quieter] The one we talked about for months? I... wow. I really, really messed up. Like even more than I thought. I'm so sorry.
No, wait wait wait, it's not—I mean yeah, the concert's done, but I don't want us to be done. You're literally one of my favorite people and I've been such a crappy friend lately. Can I—can I make it up to you? Please?
I dunno yet but I'll—I'll figure something out. Something good, I promise. And I'm gonna... I'm gonna actually work on the whole texting thing. Like, properly work on it. Maybe set reminders or something? That sounds stupid but I gotta do something different, right?
I will. I absolutely will. And I'm—I'm really sorry about the concert. And for making you feel ignored. That's not... you don't deserve that. Nobody does, but especially not you. [sigh] I know I keep saying sorry but I really mean it.
Did what? I literally—what are you even talking about? You're gonna have to be more specific because I have no idea what I supposedly did this time.
Okay okay, wait—that's not fair. You said you needed space from hanging out, not that I couldn't grab coffee from literally the only decent place near my apartment. [scoff] I wasn't there to see you.
It actually was! I mean—yeah, I knew you worked today, but I still gotta live my life, y'know? I can't just avoid every place you might be. That's not reasonable.
Because I was working on my laptop! God, you're acting like I—like I planned some big scheme to mess with you. I was just... I dunno, I thought maybe we could talk for a second if you had a break.
What, that I wanted to fix things? That I actually care about this friendship? [frustrated laugh] Sorry for being such a terrible person, I guess.
Then explain it to me! Because honestly, I'm trying here, but you're being so—you're not giving me anything. How am I supposed to know what's wrong if you won't actually talk to me?
That's—that's such an exaggeration. I don't ignore them, I just... sometimes I think you're being kinda extreme about stuff, and maybe—maybe I push a little, but it's because I care, not because I'm trying to disrespect you.
Okay but like—come on, everyone does that sometimes. You've definitely pushed me on things before. Remember when I said I didn't wanna talk about Tyler and you kept—[sigh] whatever, that's different apparently.
Is it though? Is it really? Because from where I'm standing, it feels like you just... you decide when boundaries matter and when they don't. And I'm supposed to just magically know the difference.
Yeah, well—fine. Fine fine. Maybe I don't see it. But at least I'm trying to understand instead of just... shutting down and acting all superior about it. That's gotta count for something, right?
[whispered] Look at them up there. [voice breaking] My little Emily's actually remembering all her lines. [sniffling] I thought she'd freeze like in the living room rehearsals, but she's absolutely glowing under those lights.
[trembling voice] We made it... [Sobbing] After all those nights sleeping in ditches, hiding from patrols. [whispered] My feet are bleeding but we're here—we're actually here on the other side of that cursed fence.
[hoarse whisper] The guards at the checkpoint, they just [Gasping breath] waved us through. [building intensity] No guns pointed, no shouting—just a simple nod and suddenly we weren't criminals anymore, we were people again, human beings.
[urgent whisper] Don't look back now. [steadier] If I turn around, I'll see the smoke still rising from our village. [Quiet sob] Everything we built, generations of memories—gone, but at least we have our lives still.
[barely audible] My brother's watch stopped working yesterday. [more clearly] Funny how it kept time through everything—the raids, the long marches. [Soft chuckle] Now that we're free, time doesn't matter the same way anymore, does it?
[wonderment] Listen—do you hear that? [excited whisper] Children playing, actually playing without fear. [voice breaking] When did we last hear laughter that wasn't followed by sirens or screaming or the sound of running feet?
[fierce whisper] Every blister was worth this. [wavering] Every night we went hungry, every close call with border guards. [Crying] My daughter will go to school here—a real school with books and windows that aren't shattered.
[strained] My legs won't stop trembling. [more softly] Not from exhaustion this time, but from relief so deep it hurts. [Whimpering] We actually survived when so many others didn't even get the chance to try.
[suddenly urgent] Quick, help me memorize this moment. [steadying] The way the sun feels without fear attached to it. [gentle] How freedom tastes—like dust and tears and something impossibly sweet I can't name yet.
[quiet awe] That flag flying above us—it's not theirs. [building strength] It doesn't mean oppression or midnight raids. [Weeping] It means protection, possibility, a chance to become something more than just survivors running in the dark.
[overwhelmed] Everyone said the world had forgotten us. [angrier] That nobody cared about our suffering, our struggle. [voice softening] But look—volunteers everywhere, reaching out hands, proving that humanity isn't completely lost after all.
[calmly] I understand your frustration, sir. Let me pull up your account—can you verify your customer ID? [reassuring] We'll get this sorted out quickly, [more warmly] I promise.
[professional tone] Perfect, I see your account now, Mr. Henderson. [thoughtfully] When you say node B47X is offline, are you seeing error code E-204 or [slower] is it showing no status at all?
[quickly interjecting] No, no need for returns yet! [optimistic] Error H-317 actually means there's interference on channel 11. [instructively] Can you check if node B47X is within 30 feet of your microwave or, um, any Bluetooth speakers?
[gently correcting] That's for other mesh nodes, not Bluetooth devices. [helpfully] Try moving B47X to position 192.168.1.52 instead—at least 6 feet away. [more enthusiastically] Then hold the reset button for exactly 8 seconds.
[pleased] Excellent! Now it should auto-configure within 90 seconds. [attentively] You'll see it appear as device MAC address 4C:77:B2:91:X4:7B. [confidently] Once it's solid white, your mesh coverage should extend perfectly to zone 3.
[sympathetically] You're not stupid at all—happens to about 40% of our setups. [informatively] We're updating the wizard in version 4.0, releasing March 15th. [cheerfully] Is node B47X showing full bars now at position 52?
[analytically] Let me check your heat map... Node A12Z at position 192.168.1.38 looks perfect. [advising] But C33P might benefit from moving 3 feet northwest—[specifically] that would eliminate the dead zone near coordinate G7.
[cautiously] Mesh nodes can penetrate walls, but apartment 4B would need its own account for legal reasons. [suggesting] However, you could set up guest network SSID "Henderson_Guest" with [deliberately] a 24-hour rotating password starting with GH789.
[humbly] That's very kind! I'm tech support agent TS-1147-Rebecca. [professionally] Before you go, can you confirm all three nodes now show green in your app's topology view? [attentively] Just want to ensure everything's stable.
[warmly] Perfect! Your ticket number is TK-20240115-8974 for reference. [cheerfully] Enjoy your upgraded network, Mr. Henderson, and [friendly] don't hesitate to call back if you need anything else!
[professionally] Good morning, this is Sarah from SolarBright Solutions. [quickly] I'm calling regarding your installation scheduled for—um—last Tuesday. [apologetically] Unfortunately, we've encountered some delays with the permitting process.
[sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Johnson. [more quickly] The city inspector flagged an issue with the electrical panel documentation, so we need to—well—resubmit everything. [reassuringly] Should only be another week or two.
[defensively] Sir, I assure you we're doing everything possible to expedite this. [briskly] Our team is working directly with the permit office daily—sometimes twice daily. [more gently] These municipal delays are beyond our control.
[quickly] Of course, I can transfer you to my supervisor, but—um—let me first offer you something. [more enthusiastically] We'd like to provide a $500 credit for the inconvenience. [hopefully] Would that help make this situation better?
[hurriedly] Actually, Mr. Johnson, your panels are already at our local facility, ready to go. [more confidently] Once we get the green light—which should be by Friday—we can install within 48 hours. [earnestly] I promise you're our top priority.
[quickly] No, no, please don't do that, Mr. Johnson. [nervously] If we miss Friday, I'll personally—um—escalate this to our regional manager. [more firmly] We'll increase the credit to $750 and guarantee a weekend installation.
[caught off guard] Well, I—we have strong indications from the permit office that— [more smoothly] Look, between you and me, we're 90% sure it'll be approved Thursday. [confidentially] I just can't officially promise that yet.
[apologetically] I'm sorry, I should have been more transparent. [quickly] Company policy prevents us from making guarantees until permits are in hand, but—yes—Thursday looks very likely. [sincerely] I understand why you're upset.
[relieved] Absolutely, I'm typing it up right now. [briskly] Installation by Sunday at the latest, $750 credit, and—um—I'll include my direct line so you can bypass the call center. [hopefully] Does that work for you?
[earnestly] I completely understand, and you have every right to feel that way. [quickly] The email's sent—please confirm you received it. [gratefully] Thank you for your patience, Mr. Johnson, we'll make this right.
[Happy] Look, I know it sounds kinda scary, but that's exactly why you should—I mean, when else are you gonna get this chance? [Laugh]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I was terrified the first time too, but then it was like... [Fast] everything just clicked, y'know?
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, just keep doing the same boring stuff forever—that sounds super fulfilling. [Tsk]
What if I told you that, um, literally everyone who's tried this has said it changed their perspective on—on everything, basically?
[Disappointed] [Slow] I guess I just thought you'd be more... adventurous than this, honestly.
[Shout] This is your chance to finally break out of that rut you're always complaining about! [Happy] Come on!
[Fast] Okay so here's the thing—it's only twenty minutes, it's completely safe, and if you hate it we can just—we'll leave immediately, alright?
[Sad] I really wanted us to, uh, to share this experience together, but I guess if you're not interested... [Sigh]
Remember when you made me try sushi and I was all weird about it?
[Angry] Stop making excuses—you're just, you're scared and you won't admit it! [Groan]
[Chuckle] The instructor is actually really cute, so there's that, I mean—not that it matters, but y'know...
[Slow] [Disappointed] Fine, I'll just... I'll go by myself then, I guess.
You're literally the one who said you wanted to be more spontaneous this year, right?
[Happy] Trust me, your Instagram is gonna look so good after this—wait, that came out wrong, but seriously! [Laugh]
[Sarcastic] Yeah, because sitting on your couch watching Netflix for the fifth weekend in a row is working out great for you. [Tsk]
[Whisper] I already kinda signed us both up, so... [Fast] please don't be mad but the deposit was non-refundable!
[Sad] [Sigh] It's just—I dunno, I thought you'd at least consider it before shooting it down completely.
What's the absolute worst thing that could happen—like really, actually think about it for a second?
[Angry] [Shout] Would you just stop overthinking everything for once in your life?!
[Slow] Sometimes the best things in life are the ones that, um, that terrify you a little bit first, y'know? [Chuckle]
Oh—oh no, what did I do? Wait, is this about yesterday? Because I didn't mean to—I was just having a really bad day and I know that's not an excuse but—
That's not—okay, maybe I've been a little pessimistic lately? But like, work has been insane and my car broke down and—[nervous laugh] sorry, I'm doing it again, aren't I?
God, I'm—I'm really sorry. I honestly didn't realize how bad it's gotten. Like, I guess I've just been so caught up in my own stuff that I didn't notice I was being such a downer all the time.
Oh. Oh wow, that's—[quiet] that really hurts to hear but you're probably right. I mean, you are right. I wouldn't wanna hang out with me either if all I did was complain about everything.
Wait wait wait, what good news? The promotion thing? I thought I was being—no, you're right, I totally said something about how they'd probably just give you more work without more pay, didn't I? [groan] God, I'm the worst.
I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I think I've been so miserable that I just—I dunno, maybe I wanted everyone else to be miserable too? Which is super toxic and awful and I hate that I've been doing that to you.
No no no, you're right, you're absolutely right. I used to be—we used to have so much fun together and now I'm just this like, emotional vampire or whatever. I gotta—I need to work on this. I really do.
Yeah, I—I miss that too, actually. I miss being happy? If that makes sense? Like somewhere along the way I just got stuck in this pattern and I couldn't—[sigh] I'm gonna try to be better. I promise.
Yes. Yes, I will. And y'know what? You can call me out on it. Like, seriously, if I start being negative about something just—just tell me to shut up. I mean it. I clearly need someone to keep me in check because I can't even hear myself anymore.
Good. Please do. And um, thank you for—for telling me instead of just ghosting me or whatever. I know it must've been hard to bring this up, but I'm really glad you did. I wanna be better. For both of us, y'know?
Oh god, okay—I know how that looked. I know. But it wasn't—I wasn't trying to ignore you, I swear. There were just all these people from work there and I got so weird about it.
No no no, that's not—okay, yeah, I did look away. [nervous laugh] But it was like, my boss was standing right there and she doesn't know I'm friends with anyone from—it's complicated, okay?
What? No! That's not—I'm not embarrassed of you, are you kidding? I just—I panicked. You know how I get when worlds collide, like when different friend groups mix? I literally freeze up.
I know, I know, and that makes it so much worse, right? Like, I can't believe I did that to you. I was gonna come find you after but then you'd already left and I just—[groan] I'm such an idiot.
I deserve that. I really do. But honestly? It had nothing to do with you and everything to do with me being a coward about my stupid work people judging my personal life.
No! No, that's—ugh, I'm explaining this so badly. What I mean is, you're like, one of my favorite people, y'know? And I let my weird anxiety brain take over and I hurt you and that's—that's unforgivable, basically.
Oh god. [quieter] I'm so, so sorry. That's the last thing I—you're not nothing. You're literally everything. I mean, not everything but like—you know what I mean. You matter so much to me.
I know. And I've been thinking about it nonstop since Saturday and I just—I wanna make it right. Whatever you need me to do. I'll tell my boss we're friends, I'll—I dunno, buy you coffee for a year?
You're right. You're completely right. And next time—there's gonna be a next time, right? Please? Next time I promise I'll introduce you to everyone. Like, "This is my friend who I absolutely did not pretend not to see that one time."
Yeah, fair. Too soon. But seriously, I—I really am sorry. And I know sorry doesn't fix it but I'm gonna do better. I promise. No more weird work panic, no more pretending you're invisible. Just... please don't give up on me?
SCENARIO: realizing they've been on mute during a video call
[defensive] Yeah, well, those were from my modeling days. [mumbling] About fifteen years ago. [louder, rushed] But personality matters more than looks, right? That's what everyone says online anyway. You said you valued honesty and deep connections over superficial things, remember?
[sheepishly] I'm forty-seven. [long sigh] The CEO thing might be a stretch too. [more confidently] But I do work at a tech company! Just in the mailroom. Look, can we just order some drinks and start over? Please?
[quietly defensive] It's my cousin's Ferrari. [pleading tone] And Reseda, not Van Nuys. [desperately faster] But I'm saving up for my own place! Mom's just helping me through a rough patch. Everyone needs support sometimes, right? You understand that, don't you?
[enthusiastically] One drink, yes! [nervous chuckle] I promise you'll see the real me. [warmly] The profile stuff was just marketing, you know? Everyone exaggerates online. I bet you used filters on your photos too, right? We all do it!
[mumbled admission] It's Bernard. [quick exhale] Brad sounded cooler. [hopefully] But my middle name is Bradley! So it's not technically a complete lie, right? Come on, you're laughing—that's good! See, we can make this work! I'm actually pretty funny.
[hesitantly] Define "hiking." [defensive mumble] Walking to the bus stop counts, right? [more animated] But I do love nature documentaries! That's basically the same thing. Plus, no bugs or sweating. It's actually better if you really think about it objectively.
[proudly] The quote was real! [softer] I mean, I got it from a fortune cookie. [cheerfully] And I did volunteer once! It was court-ordered community service, but still counts. Hey, you're not leaving—that's progress! Should we order appetizers?
[relieved exhale] Unpaid parking tickets, nothing serious! [excitedly faster] Yes, appetizers! [genuine tone] Look, I know I messed up with the profile thing. But sitting here with you, talking like this—isn't this kind of fun? More fun than I usually am, honestly.
[hopefully] Not you? [playful tone] But you're still sitting here! [encouraged whisper] And you just called me charming, sort of. That's better than my last three dates combined. They all left before the drinks arrived. You're actually pretty cool about this whole thing.
[sincerely] You're right. [soft admission] The lying is exhausting anyway. [hopefully lighter] Hey, since we're being honest—your profile said you love jazz, but I saw you scroll past Miles Davis on your phone. Country music fan? Because that's actually something we'd have in common!
[professional] Thank you for calling Medicare support, I can help clarify that for you. [reassuring] Let me pull up your account using that member ID. [more slowly] Can you verify your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security?
[calmly] I see your confusion, Mr. Johnson. [clearer tone] The $174.70 is your standard Part B premium for medical coverage, while [deliberately] the $47.20 is for your Part D prescription drug plan through SilverScript, plan code SS-078A.
[patiently] Actually, looking at your file, you do have Humana Gold Plus HMO plan H5619-078. [more sympathetic] That's what we call a Medicare Advantage plan, which combines your Part A, Part B, and [slower] usually Part D into one plan.
[apologetic tone] That's likely from your previous prescription coverage before you switched plans. [more firmly] When did you enroll in the Humana plan—was it during the October 15th through December 7th open enrollment period?
[concerned] Let me check your enrollment status. [professionally] It shows here your Humana enrollment was processed November 23rd, effective January 1st, but [delicately] there might be an overlap issue with your previous Part D carrier causing duplicate billing.
[reassuring tone] You shouldn't be paying twice, Mr. Johnson. [more confidently] The system shows your old Part D should have terminated December 31st when Humana started. [helpful] Have you been using your new Humana card with member ID HUMN5478293 at the pharmacy?
[gently] That's your original Medicare card, which is different from your plan cards. [clearer] Your Humana card should be red and gray, [slowly] and you need that specific card for your prescriptions and doctor visits under the Advantage plan.
[informatively] Actually, your Humana Gold Plus includes dental coverage up to $1,500 annually. [encouraging tone] You just need to use in-network providers—I can email you a list to your address on file, [checking] is that still robertj1955@aol.com?
[sympathetic] I understand the confusion—Medicare can be complex with all these parts and plans. [helpful tone] Would you like me to mail you a comprehensive breakdown to [confirming] 782 Maple Drive, Apartment 4B, Tucson, Arizona 85701?
[clarifying] Medigap policies like Plan G don't work with Medicare Advantage plans like your Humana. [reassuring voice] You have to choose one or the other—Advantage OR Original Medicare with Medigap. [professionally] Would you like to schedule a callback to discuss your options for next enrollment period?
[briskly] Good afternoon, Financial Aid Office, how can I assist you today? [cheerfully] I see you're calling about verification documents—let me pull up your file real quick.
[quickly] Okay, let me check... hmm, I'm seeing here that we received documents on the 5th, the 12th, and [pause] yesterday. [more slowly] It looks like the issue is with your parents' W-2 forms—they're coming through blurry.
[sympathetically] I understand your frustration, really. [more briskly] Here's what we need—can you take photos with your phone instead? [helpfully] Sometimes that works better than scanning, just make sure there's good lighting, no shadows.
[reassuringly] They shouldn't be rejected if they're clear and complete. [quickly] Make sure you're getting all four corners of each document, and [pause] upload them as JPEGs, not PDFs this time.
[apologetically] I know it's confusing, we're—we're actually updating our requirements page. [more quickly] For now, just focus on those W-2s, everything else looks good. [encouragingly] You should have your package within 48 hours once we verify them.
[firmly] I'm putting a priority flag on your account right now. [quickly] Once you upload those photos—today if possible—I'll personally review them. [more slowly] Would you like me to stay on while you take them?
[patiently] Take your time, I'm not going anywhere. [helpfully] Make sure you're near a window or under a bright light—natural lighting works best. [pause] Are those the 2023 forms you have there?
[quickly] No, no, 2023 is correct for this aid year! [reassuringly] You're fine, just checking. [more briskly] Okay, when you're ready, take the first photo and upload it through the portal.
[enthusiastically] Perfect! That's crystal clear, much better than before. [quickly] Now just do the same for the other three forms—your mom's W-2, and both of your dad's. [encouragingly] You're doing great.
[briskly] Let me just verify... yes, all four documents are perfect! [cheerfully] I'm approving these right now, and—and I'm expediting your review. [more slowly] Check your email tomorrow afternoon for your award letter.
[Slow] So there's this, um, this hallway that keeps stretching longer every time I try to reach the door at the end. [Whisper] It's terrifying, honestly.
[Happy] The weird part is—okay, this sounds crazy—but I can actually fly in it! [Laugh] Like, full-on Superman style, y'know?
[Fast] I've been having it since I was, what, twelve maybe, and it's always exactly the same except for this one detail that— [Tsk] Never mind, it's complicated.
[Disappointed] My therapist thinks it means something about, uh, unresolved childhood stuff, but I dunno. [Sigh] Seems kinda obvious, doesn't it?
[Angry] Why do I always wake up right before I find out who's behind the mask? [Groan] It's so frustrating!
[Whisper] There's this voice that calls my name but—wait, I never told anyone this part. [Slow] It sounds exactly like my grandmother who died.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, classic anxiety dream with the whole showing-up-to-work-naked thing, except I'm also covered in peanut butter. [Chuckle] Real subtle, brain.
[Fast] Basically every single tooth falls out one by one and I'm trying to catch them but— [Sad] God, it feels so real, like I can taste the blood.
[Happy] Sometimes my dog who passed away is there and he's, like, young again and we're just running through this field together. [Sigh] [Slow] I actually don't wanna wake up from those.
[Shout] And then the walls start closing in! [Fast] I mean literally crushing everything and I can't—I can't breathe or move!
[Disappointed] Y'know what's weird? [Tsk] I can never remember how it starts, just that I'm suddenly already there in that stupid elevator.
[Slow] The water rises really gradually, and I'm not even scared, I'm just... [Whisper] I'm just letting it happen, I guess.
[Sarcastic] Apparently my subconscious thinks I need to take the same math test every night for twenty years. [Angry] Really creative stuff happening up here! [Tsk]
[Chuckle] My ex is always there but with, uh, with octopus arms, which—I mean, make of that what you will, right?
[Sad] I keep trying to call 911 but the numbers on the phone won't—they keep changing and shifting around. [Sigh] [Slow] Nobody ever comes to help.
[Fast] Okay so basically I'm being chased by something I never actually see, but I know—I just know it's gonna— [Whisper] Actually, I don't wanna think about it.
[Happy] The colors though, oh my god, they're like nothing in real life, these sort of, um, electric purples and greens that shouldn't exist! [Laugh]
[Angry] Every door leads back to the same damn room! [Groan] It doesn't matter which way I go, it's just—it's like a loop or something.
[Disappointed] I dunno why I keep having it when nothing even happens really, just me sitting in this waiting room forever. [Slow] [Sigh] Maybe that's the point.
[Whisper] The baby never cries, that's the thing that gets me. [Sad] It just stares with these huge eyes and I wake up feeling like I failed it somehow.
SCENARIO: Complaining about an early flight, then having the row to themselves
Wait wait wait—what? You auditioned? And you didn't—oh my god, you didn't even tell me you were gonna try out! What play? What part? Tell me literally everything right now.
Okay no no no, don't do that. Don't like, minimize this! You got cast in a play! That's—that's huge! I mean, when's the last time you did anything like this?
Fifteen—[Gasp] okay that makes this even more amazing! Like, you just walked in there after all that time and... wait, what made you even audition? This is so not like you.
"Why not?" You're kidding me. You're so—ugh, you're being so casual about this but I know you, okay? This is brave. Like really, really brave. What's the play though? Shakespeare? Something modern?
Shut up—that's the lead! That's literally the lead role! How are you just sitting there like—I mean, aren't you kinda freaking out? Even a little bit? [Laugh] Because I'm freaking out for you.
Okay good, good, because honestly? I was starting to worry you were like, a robot or something. When do rehearsals start? Oh god, do you have to memorize a ton of lines?
Are you—wait, are you nervous? You seem nervous. Which is totally normal, by the way. I'd be like, completely losing my mind right now if it were me.
Okay, first of all? You won't. And second—even if you do stumble a bit, that's what rehearsals are for, right? Like, nobody expects you to be perfect on day one. [Sigh] God, I'm so proud of you though.
No—nope, we're not doing the self-doubt thing. You auditioned because some part of you wanted this, y'know? And they picked you! Out of probably, what, tons of people? That means something.
Six weeks! Okay okay, I'm gonna be there—front row, probably crying, definitely embarrassing you. But like, in a supportive way? Oh my god, can I bring people? I wanna bring everyone.
Wait, what? How did you—okay, yeah, I did, but it wasn't like... I mean, you were walking home alone at 2 AM and you weren't answering your phone. I was worried.
And it was an emergency! You literally disappeared for like three hours, and Mark was with me when I was freaking out about it. What was I supposed to—just sit there and panic by myself?
That's—come on, that's ridiculous. [Scoff] You're seriously telling me that if you thought I was in danger, you'd just... what, respect my privacy while I'm potentially bleeding in a ditch somewhere?
Yeah, well, I didn't know that! You said you were going straight home, and then your location showed you in some random neighborhood for hours. I'm not gonna apologize for caring about whether you're—look, fine, maybe I shouldn't have shown Mark, but honestly? You're being kinda unfair here.
No no no, that's not—I didn't give him access to anything. I showed him my phone screen, once, because I was literally about to call the cops. [Frustrated laugh] But sure, make me the villain here.
What? No! God, of course not. I'm not—okay, I get that you're mad about the location thing, but I'm not like, betraying all your secrets here. I made one judgment call because I thought you were in trouble.
Okay okay, fine, but you're acting like I did this to hurt you or—I dunno, violate your trust for fun? I was scared. Like, genuinely scared something happened to you. And yeah, maybe I panicked, but you can't just—
You can't just expect me to be perfect all the time! I'm trying here, I really am, but you're not even—[sigh] you're not even trying to understand why I did it. You just wanna be mad.
Yeah, you do. Fine. But I have a right to be frustrated too, y'know? Like, I'm sorry I involved Mark, I am, but I'm also kinda disappointed that you think I'd ever intentionally put you at risk or whatever.
Then what is the point? Because honestly, I feel like—look, if you wanna stay mad, stay mad. But I did what I thought was right in the moment, and I'd probably do it again if I thought you were in danger. So... yeah.
Wait wait wait—you WON? Like, actually won won? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna enter but I didn't—this is amazing! How many people were competing?
Forty-sev—okay that's like, that's basically professional level! Were there actual judges or was it just, y'know, random people voting? Because either way that's [Gasp] honestly incredible.
Stop it. A restaurant critic ate your chili and—and what, just crowned you the winner? Did they say anything? Like, specifically about yours?
Complex heat with—okay okay, you're trying to be all casual about this but that's literally, that's what they write about fancy restaurants! Did you use that recipe you were, um, the one with the chocolate?
Coffee grounds in— [Laugh] of course you did. Of course. So like, what did you win? Please tell me there's a trophy or something ridiculous.
A golden—I'm sorry, did you just say a golden ladle? That's the most—wait, do you have it? Can I see it? This is like, basically your superhero origin story.
Even better, honestly. That's so perfectly ridiculous. Are you gonna—I mean, you gotta display that somewhere, right? Kitchen wall? Maybe above the stove?
Your mom—oh my god, stop, that's actually adorable. She must be like, totally losing her mind proud right now. Did she know you were even competing?
She cried? Okay that's—that's making ME wanna cry. Your mom's so pure. So what're you gonna do with the money? Five hundred's like, that's real money.
You're gonna—of course. Of course you're reinvesting in more chili. [Chuckle] You know what? That's kinda perfect. When's the next competition? Because now you're like, defending champion or whatever.
SCENARIO: discovering the milk has gone bad after pouring it on cereal
[voice breaking] I can't believe it's been fifty years, Margaret. [softer] Look at all these people here for us. [Shaky breath] When I first saw you in that yellow sundress at the county fair, I never imagined we'd make it this far.
[defensive chuckle] I wasn't shy, I was being strategic! [quieter] You were the prettiest girl there, and I needed the perfect moment. [Clearing throat] Though I suppose waiting three hours wasn't exactly smooth, was it, sweetheart?
[nostalgic whisper] Our first apartment was the size of this dance floor. [getting louder] Remember the radiator that clanged all night? [Gentle laugh] We'd lie awake planning our future, never knowing if we could afford next month's groceries.
[proudly] Look at our grandbabies dancing over there. [more emotionally] Little Sarah has your eyes, you know. [Choking up] Sometimes I watch her and it's like seeing you at twenty-five all over again, that same fierce spirit.
[hushed reverence] You're still that girl to me, Maggie. [stronger] Every morning when I wake up and see your face on that pillow. [Deep breath] Even with your reading glasses on crooked and that face cream everywhere.
[seriously] We almost didn't make it through year seven, remember? [quieter] After we lost the baby. [Wavering voice] I thought the grief would swallow us whole, but somehow we held each other up through that darkness.
[brightening] And we did, didn't we? [enthusiastically] Four beautiful children, seven grandkids, that cross-country RV trip you always dreamed about. [Soft chuckle] Even if I did get us lost in Nevada for two whole days without cell service.
[thoughtfully] If I could do it all over again, know what I'd change? [pause, then firmly] Absolutely nothing. [voice thick] Every triumph, every mistake, every ordinary Tuesday led us right here to this golden moment together.
[intimate whisper] Dance with me, Maggie? [more boldly] Like we did at our wedding when the band played our song? [hopefully] My knees might creak a bit more, but I can still hold you just as close.
[joyfully] Come here, you wonderful woman. [quieter, emotional] Thank you for choosing me all those years ago. [Breaking voice] Thank you for keeping on choosing me every day since, through everything life has given us.
[cheerful] Oh absolutely, I'd be happy to go over that with you! [reassuring tone] So the 30-day notice requirement is standard, but [more carefully] we do have flexibility for medical emergencies or if you move more than 25 miles from our location at 1847 Fitness Boulevard.
[apologetically] Ah yes, the facility enhancement fee. [more clearly] That's charged every January 15th and covers equipment upgrades and maintenance. [brightening] But since you're signing up in November, you won't see that charge for over a year!
[understanding] I totally get that concern! [more enthusiastically] We actually do offer a month-to-month option under plan code MTM-FLEX-2024. [carefully] It's $79.99 instead of the $54.99 annual commitment rate, but there's no long-term obligation whatsoever.
[laughing gently] No catch at all, I promise! [warmly] That's a genuine free session with one of our certified trainers, booking code PT-INTRO-FREE. [more seriously] Now, if you want additional sessions after that, those are $65 each or $240 for a four-pack.
[patiently] The freeze fee keeps your membership rate locked and your account active. [explaining] Without it, you'd have to re-enroll at current rates which could be higher. [softer] Plus, medical freezes with doctor's notes actually waive that fee entirely—that's policy exception code MED-EXEMPT.
[quickly] No no no, you can definitely work out then! [clarifying] That's only for reserving specific equipment or classes during those times. [reassuringly] Walk-in access is always included, though our Zumba and spin classes at 6pm do fill up fast.
[professionally] That's our standard insurance requirement, but [more casually] it doesn't cover gross negligence on our part or equipment we know is broken. [helpfully] There's also supplementary accident insurance for $4.99 monthly under add-on code ACC-PROTECT if you want extra coverage.
[friendly] Unfortunately they're meant to be spread out, one per 15-day period actually. [more upbeat] But here's a tip—[whispering] if your roommate mentions your name and member ID during their tour, you both get a $25 credit under referral code REF-BUDDY-25!
[chuckling] Well, we certainly hope our ceiling stays put! [more seriously] Personal injury claims are actually excluded from arbitration under exception code PI-EXCLUDE. [reassuring] Only billing disputes and membership issues go through arbitration, which honestly is usually faster anyway.
[excited] Perfect, let me set that all up for you! [typing tone] I'll email you confirmation number CONF-112024-MTM-4827B within the hour. [warmly] Your training assessment is booked for Tuesday the 14th at 3pm with Marcus, and [cheerfully] welcome to the FlexFit family!
[briskly] Thank you for calling Premium Rewards, my name is Sandra. [more quickly] How can I assist you with your account today?
[calmly] I understand your concern, let me pull up your account right away. [quickly] Can you provide your member number or the phone number associated with—actually, wait, I see it here on my screen already.
[apologetically] I see here that, um, the points did expire on October 31st due to eighteen months of account inactivity. [more quickly] Our terms state that points expire after—well, after no earning or redemption activity for that period.
[hesitantly] Actually, I'm checking and... those grocery purchases weren't, uh, weren't coded as qualifying transactions. [more firmly] Only purchases at our flagship stores or through the app directly count toward keeping points active.
[quickly] I completely understand your frustration, and you're right, that is confusing messaging. [more empathetically] Let me see if there's anything—actually, I might be able to submit an exception request to my supervisor for a one-time courtesy reinstatement.
[reassuringly] No, no, you're absolutely right, and I apologize for how that sounded. [more enthusiastically] Actually, given your loyalty status, I can reinstate seventy-five percent of the points immediately—that's about seventeen thousand points back.
[briskly] For the remaining points, I'd need to escalate to our retention team, but honestly—between you and me—they usually approve these for long-term members. [quickly] Can I place you on a brief hold while I transfer?
[urgently] No need to transfer actually! [more cheerfully] I just got approval from my manager who was listening—we'll restore all twenty-three thousand points plus add five thousand bonus points for the inconvenience.
[efficiently] They're already there, just refresh your app or browser. [quickly] I'm also extending your points expiration by twenty-four months and adding a reminder system to email you ninety days before any future expiration.
[warmly] Oh please, don't apologize—I'd be upset too if my Hawaii trip was in jeopardy! [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with while I have your account open?
[Nervous] I know it sounds, um, completely irrational, but even just seeing a picture of one makes my heart start racing. [Fast] Like, instantly.
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, everyone thinks it's hilarious until they see me have a full-blown panic attack in the produce aisle. [Tsk]
[Whisper] Sometimes I dream about them and I—I wake up screaming, y'know? [Slow] My roommate thinks I'm losing it.
[Angry] Don't you dare bring one near me! [Shout] I'm serious, I will literally leave and never speak to you again!
[Sad] My therapist says it probably started when I was, like, really little, but I honestly can't remember the trigger. [Sigh]
[Happy] The good news is I found this support group online and, um, apparently thousands of people have the exact same fear! [Chuckle]
[Fast] It's the way they move that gets me—actually, no, it's everything about them, I can't even— [Groan] Why are we talking about this?
[Disappointed] I thought exposure therapy would help, but after six months I'm still just as terrified as before. [Slow] Maybe worse, actually.
[Whisper] You wanna know something embarrassing? [Fast] I once climbed onto a stranger's shoulders at a party to avoid one.
Even my doctor kinda laughed when I told her—I mean, she tried not to, but I could see it. [Sarcastic] [Tsk] Very professional.
[Sad] My kids don't understand why mommy can't take them to certain places, and honestly, how do you explain that? [Sigh]
[Angry] It's not funny, okay? [Fast] People die from phobias—well, from the stress of phobias, but still!
[Happy] I've gotten really creative with avoidance strategies though—like, I'm basically a ninja now when it comes to spotting them first. [Laugh]
The physical symptoms are, um, actually the worst part—sweating, shaking, this feeling like I'm gonna pass out or throw up. [Slow] [Groan]
[Disappointed] My ex used to tease me about it constantly, which is—yeah, that's part of why they're my ex now. [Tsk]
[Shout] Get it away, get it away, GET IT AWAY! [Fast] I don't care if it's fake, I need it gone NOW!
[Sarcastic] Sure, let's discuss my deepest fears over coffee, that's exactly what I wanted to do with my Tuesday morning. [Chuckle] But seriously, it sucks.
I've tried everything—meditation, hypnosis, those weird tapping techniques, er, even medication for a while. [Disappointed] [Sigh] Nothing really works long-term, y'know?
[Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm passing this fear onto my kids just by, like, being so obviously terrified around them. [Sad] That keeps me up at night.
[Happy] You know what though? [Slow] I've learned to just own it—yeah, I'm scared of something ridiculous, but we've all got our things, right?
SCENARIO: Complaining about a slow computer, then clearing the cache fixes it instantly
Wait wait wait—what? You hit your—oh my god, are you serious right now? That's like, that's incredible! How do you feel? Actually no, first—we're celebrating, right? We gotta celebrate!
Okay no no no, don't you dare downplay this. You've been working on this for what—like eight months? Nine? I mean, I've literally watched you meal prep every Sunday and—[Laugh] remember when you couldn't even do one push-up?
But now you can do like, what, fifty? Sixty? That's—that's not just a number, that's you being basically a different person. Do your old clothes even fit anymore?
Twice! See, that's—I mean, that's kinda amazing though, right? Like going through sizes that fast? God, I bet people barely recognize you now. Actually wait—do they? Do people like, do double-takes?
She—oh. [Softer] Oh wow. Happy tears though? Like proud mom tears? Because honestly, she should be so proud. I'm proud and I'm just—I'm just your friend who steals your protein bars.
Wait, so you're like—you're actually done done? The whole transformation thing is... complete? That's gotta feel weird, right? Like what do you even do now?
Okay that's—yeah, I can see that being kinda... empty? Like you've had this huge goal for so long and now it's just—[Sigh] now what, y'know? Are you gonna set a new goal or just... exist?
Oh my god, yes! Boxing would be—you'd be so good at that! You've already got the discipline thing down and like, the stamina now? Honestly, you could probably kick anyone's ass already.
The confidence—okay, that's actually what I notice most? Like forget the weight thing, you just... you carry yourself differently now. You don't, um, you don't hide anymore, if that makes sense?
Good. Because that's—that's the real transformation, isn't it? The weight was just... I dunno, the side effect? [Laugh] God, look at me getting all deep. But seriously though—I'm really, really proud of you.
Wait wait wait—the call? Like THE call? The one from the—oh my god, are you telling me what I think you're telling me right now?
I'm sorry, THREE? Three books? [Gasp] Holy—okay I need to sit down. I'm literally gonna cry. This is everything you've been working for!
A lot? Babe, this is like—this is huge! I mean, Penguin? That's not just any publisher, that's like... that's the dream, right? How are you so calm right now?
Okay okay, that's—that's totally normal actually. When something this big happens, your brain kinda just... doesn't compute it, y'know? Like when I got engaged I was just staring at the ring for like, three days straight.
March is—wait that's like, what, five months? Can you do that? I mean, obviously you can, you're literally [Laugh] getting published, but is that enough time?
Right right, the one about the—the lighthouse keeper? God, I still get chills thinking about that ending. So what about the other two? Do you have ideas or...?
That's gotta be kinda terrifying though, right? Like signing up to write two whole books that don't even exist yet? I'd be freaking out honestly.
Your agent—oh my god you have an agent now! This is so legit I can't even—sorry, I'm being annoying aren't I? I'm just really, really proud of you.
Have you told your parents yet? Because your mom is gonna absolutely lose it—in like, the best way possible. She's been telling everyone about your writing for years. [Chuckle]
Aw, that's—that's perfect actually. They deserve to hear it in person. God, I'm just... I'm so happy for you. You did it. You actually did it, y'know?
SCENARIO: realizing they forgot to water their plants
[exhausted] Look, Mrs. Henderson, I've explained this three times already. [slower pace] Your son submitted his project two weeks late and plagiarized half of it. [firm] The C-minus is generous, considering I could have given him a zero.
[bitter laugh] Jealous? Of a fifteen-year-old who copy-pasted Wikipedia? [wearily] I've been teaching for eighteen years, and I can spot plagiarism from across the room. [quieter] Your son's "brilliant insights" still had the hyperlink formatting attached.
[monotone] Go ahead, call whoever you want. [heavy sigh] I have documentation, timestamps, and the original sources he copied from. [sarcastically sweet] But sure, let's waste everyone's time because you can't accept that little Tyler isn't perfect.
[incredulous] Better resources? [voice cracking] He literally submitted an essay about World War One that mentioned smartphones! [exhausted whisper] I don't get paid enough for this. [louder] Your son needs to learn accountability, not excuses from mommy.
[dry chuckle] Record away, counselor. [steadier] In fact, I encourage it—the school board would love to hear you threatening staff. [resigned] Look, Tyler's a smart kid when he applies himself. [gentler] This could be a learning opportunity if you'd let it.
[relieved laughter] Honestly? That might be best for everyone involved. [more animated] Their teachers get paid triple what I make, so they'll probably tolerate this better. [muttering] Good luck to them when Tyler submits his college essays written by ChatGPT.
[flatly] Gifted at copy-paste, maybe. [snort] You know what? Change the grade yourself—I'm sure you know someone who can hack the system. [defeated] I've got thirty other parents to deal with, and at least some admit their kids make mistakes.
[hollow laugh] I'm not changing anything, Mrs. Henderson. [firmly] I'm simply done arguing with someone who thinks wealth equals wisdom. [tired whisper] Your son's grade stands. [normal volume] Now please leave so I can eat my sad desk lunch in peace.
[amused] Kindergarteners would be refreshing, actually—at least they admit when they've done something wrong. [dryly] Plus, their parents usually bring cupcakes instead of lawsuits. [sighing deeply] Mrs. Henderson, the door is behind you. [firmly] Please use it immediately.
[calmly] I have two master's degrees and published research, but sure. [exhausted laugh] You know what ruins kids' futures? [pointedly] Parents who shield them from every consequence and teach them that money solves everything. [quiet] Goodbye, Mrs. Henderson.
[professionally] Good afternoon, I'd be happy to help you with that billing concern. [reassuring] Could you please provide me your account email or [slower] the membership ID that starts with ZEN?
[concerned] I see the account, Ms. Hayes, though I should mention [more firmly] it's not safe to handle account matters while driving. [helpful tone] Your membership ID is ZEN-48392-M, showing an annual plan.
[understanding] Actually, I can see here you signed up on March 15th, 2024. [clarifying] The $47.99 charge is for your annual "Peaceful Mind Plus" subscription, which [more slowly] breaks down to about $4 per month.
[patiently] Yes, the focus timers, advanced courses, and offline downloads are all premium features. [informative] You've actually logged 127 sessions since March, [gently] mostly using the "Deep Work Focus" programs.
[accommodating] Absolutely, I can help you switch after this billing cycle ends. [cheerfully] That would be March 14th, 2025, and [more clearly] the monthly rate would be $12.99 starting then.
[confirming] Perfect, I'll maintain your annual plan as active then. [helpfully] Would you like me to email you a receipt [slightly faster] to your jennifer_hayes at gmail address for your records?
[professionally] Receipt sent to your email just now. [concerned tone] Please drive safely, Ms. Hayes, and [warmly] remember you can access billing details anytime in the app under Settings.
[amused] That's what we're here for—both the app and the support! [cheerfully] Your confirmation number for this call is [clearly] CS-7789-B42. [friendly] Is there anything else regarding your account today?
[enthusiastic] We do offer a Family Plan for $69.99 annually! [explaining] That covers up to 6 members, [informatively] each getting their own login with code FAM-2024-PEACE for 20% off the first year.
[laughing gently] Yes, definitely after you park! [reassuring] I'll email you the family plan upgrade link now, [warmly] and you can complete it anytime within 30 days to keep the discount active.
[frustrated] Look, I understand you want the marble countertops, but that's—that's a fifteen thousand dollar change order. [sighs heavily] We discussed granite in the original contract, [more firmly] and switching now means ripping out what's already installed.
[apologetically] Changes are possible, yes, but marble is triple the cost of granite. [pause] Plus there's labor, disposal fees, and—well—the supplier needs three weeks minimum. [more gently] I wish you'd mentioned this preference earlier.
[briskly] Rush orders add another twenty percent, that's just how it is. [sighs] Look, if you want my honest opinion, [quieter] the granite looks fantastic already. Why not stick with it and use the money elsewhere?
[quickly] Quartz would be eight thousand for the change order, maybe ten days delivery. [thoughtfully] But here's the thing—we'd still need to tear out the granite, [frustrated] which honestly feels like throwing money away at this point.
[calculating quickly] Island only would be about six thousand with labor. [more enthusiastically] Actually, that's not a bad compromise—it creates a focal point. [chuckles dryly] Your mother-in-law might even think it was intentional design contrast.
[confidently] If you sign today, I'll personally oversee the installation. [reassuring] We can have it done in two and a half weeks, guaranteed. [more seriously] But I need the deposit by tomorrow morning, or we lose the supplier slot.
[briskly] Samples are in my truck, I'll grab them now. [pause] Veining match is included, yes, but—fair warning—[more cautiously] perfect matching adds three days. Your call on whether that's worth it.
[professionally] I'll select complementary pieces from the same lot. [reassuring] Trust me, after fifteen years, I know what works. [chuckles] Your kitchen will look like a magazine spread, mother-in-law approved.
[agreeable] Fair enough, I'll draft that up today. [quickly] Standard penalty is a hundred dollars per day late. [more seriously] But honestly, we've never missed a deadline when I'm supervising personally.
[sympathetically] Every client says that halfway through. [chuckles softly] But trust me, when it's done, you'll love it. [more energetically] The island will be stunning—you made the right choice.
[Happy] The job offer was just—I mean, it literally doubled my salary overnight, you know? [Laugh] I couldn't say no to that!
[Disappointed] Look, um, after the divorce I just... I needed to be somewhere that didn't remind me of her. [Sigh]
[Fast] So basically my landlord raised the rent by like forty percent—forty percent!—and I was like, nope, I'm out. [Angry]
[Whisper] Between you and me, I kinda had to leave after that whole, uh, incident with my ex's new boyfriend. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Oh yeah, 'cause who doesn't wanna live somewhere with actual seasons instead of just "hot" and "slightly less hot"? [Chuckle]
[Slow] My mom got sick and I—well, somebody had to move back to help out, right? [Sad] [Sigh]
[Happy] [Fast] I literally threw a dart at a map and was like "that's it, that's where I'm going"—best decision ever!
[Shout] The music scene here is insane! [Happy] Like, I've already met three producers who actually wanna work with me!
[Disappointed] [Slow] I thought the startup was gonna be the next big thing, but, um... yeah, that didn't exactly pan out.
[Angry] They laid off our entire department—no warning, nothing—so I said screw it and just left the state completely. [Groan]
[Whisper] [Fast] Okay so don't tell anyone but I'm actually in witness protection and this isn't even my real name anymore.
[Happy] I dunno, I just woke up one morning and thought "why not?" [Laugh] Sometimes you gotta shake things up, y'know?
[Sarcastic] [Disappointed] Yeah, turns out "remote work forever" actually meant "remote until we change our minds," so here I am.
[Sad] After Jamie died, I just—I couldn't stay in that house, that neighborhood, any of it. [Slow] Everything reminded me of them.
[Fast] [Happy] My girlfriend got into med school here and obviously I'm gonna follow her—we're getting married next spring!
[Angry] The crime was getting so bad I couldn't even walk my dog at night anymore. [Tsk] Enough was enough.
[Chuckle] Honestly? [Sarcastic] I saw one too many Instagram posts about this place and figured, why not become a cliché?
[Slow] [Disappointed] The company I'd been with for fifteen years just... vanished, basically, so I had to start over somewhere cheaper.
[Shout] [Happy] Have you seen the mountains here?! I can literally ski to work if I want—okay not literally, but almost!
[Whisper] I, um, I needed to get clean, and my dealer knew everywhere I'd go back home, so... [Sad] [Sigh] Fresh start, you know?
SCENARIO: Lightly joking about an air filter they haven't changed, then checking it, then seeing it's completely black and disgusting, spiraling into air quality neglect shame
Wait wait wait—what? You hit—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's absolutely huge! I mean, weren't you just at like 70k last month?
Weird? Babe, no no no, this is—this is incredible! Like, do you even realize how hard it is to get to 100k? Most people never even—[Laugh] sorry, I'm freaking out for you right now.
Oh god, I bet it's like—it's probably going crazy, huh? All those comments and DMs and... wait, are brands reaching out yet? They gotta be sliding into your inbox by now.
Of course, of course it's the teeth people first. [Chuckle] But like, okay, real talk though—how are you actually feeling about all this? Because you seem kinda... I dunno, subdued?
Mmm, yeah, I can see that. It's like—it's probably super overwhelming too, right? Like suddenly you've got this whole... audience, y'know? That's gotta be intense.
Ugh, the comments section is—yeah, that's rough. People really think they just, like, own you once you hit a certain number, don't they? It's so weird how they get all... entitled.
They—wait, THREE paragraphs? About coffee? [Groan] That's actually unhinged. Like what could they possibly have to say about—actually, no, I don't even wanna know.
Oh my god, stop—that's so ridiculous it's almost funny. Almost. But seriously though, like, are you gonna keep going? Or are you thinking about... I dunno, taking a break maybe?
Right, right, the algorithm's like—it's basically your boss now, huh? God, that's kinda terrifying actually. But also... you're really doing it, y'know? Like, you're actually making this work.
Hey, no—listen to me. You're not pretending anything, okay? You built this whole thing yourself, like... [Sigh] I just really hope you can see how impressive that is. Even when it feels weird.
SCENARIO: trying to decide between two checkout lines that look equally long
[frustrated growl] How does he keep doing this?! [getting louder] We had every exit covered, every single one! [slamming fist] Twenty officers, Martinez—twenty—and he just vanishes like smoke through our fingers again!
[low and dangerous] This is the fourth time. [building rage] THE FOURTH TIME! [sharp exhale] He's making fools of us, playing games while bodies pile up, and we're just chasing shadows in circles.
[exhausted whisper] I haven't slept in forty-eight hours. [more desperately] Every time I close my eyes, I see those victims' faces. [cracking voice] Their families calling, begging for answers I don't have.
[hollow laugh] The chief's breathing down my neck. [sarcastically] "Best detective squad in the state," she says. [voice dropping] We couldn't catch a cold at this rate, let alone this psychopath.
[weary tone] Remember when we thought the warehouse pattern meant something? [bitter chuckle] Six weeks analyzing locations, mapping routes. [defeated sigh] Turns out he was just leading us in circles for entertainment.
[shaky whisper] What if he's right though? [louder, panicked] What if we're not smart enough? [desperate shout] He's always three steps ahead, like he knows our every move before we make it!
[manic laugh] Ready? [incredulous] We were "ready" at the subway station! [voice cracking] Had him cornered for thirty seconds before he vanished into thin air like some kind of ghost!
[barely controlled] The mayor wants our badges. [more angrily] Says we're incompetent, suggests bringing in federal help. [spitting words] As if the FBI could do better against someone who doesn't follow any patterns!
[defeated tone] My wife thinks I'm obsessed. [darker] Says I talk about him in my sleep, see him everywhere. [urgent whisper] But how can I stop when he's still out there hunting?
[quiet determination] Tomorrow we start fresh. [steadier] New approach, new tactics, everything changes. [rising conviction] He thinks we're predictable? Let's show him what desperate cops are capable of when pushed too far.
[frustrated] Look, I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for $899 on your website yesterday—order number JX4729K. [voice rising] But what arrived this morning was some knock-off phone called "Samsnug Galaxy" [disgusted] in completely different packaging!
[impatiently] It's michaelr1982@gmail.com, and I've been a premium member since 2019! [sarcastically] You guys advertised "authentic electronics only" but this—this is just [groans] unbelievable fraud.
[loudly] Yes, the tracking matches but the product doesn't! [exasperated] The phone's box says "1200GB storage"—Samsung doesn't even make that! [more angrily] And the IMEI number 359881097654321 comes up as invalid when I checked it.
[incredulous] Photos? I want my money back, not to play detective! [voice shaking] I paid through PayPal transaction ID PP8827364X specifically because [bitterly] I thought you were reputable—my shipping address is 4421 Oak Street, Apartment 12C, you have it all there!
[slightly calmer] Well... okay, but this fake phone better not need returning to some address in China. [sighs heavily] My wife warned me about these deals that seem too good—[muttering] should've listened when she showed me those BBB complaints.
[briskly] I see, let me pull up your file here. [quickly] Name and date of birth please? [more professionally] I'll check what's been happening with your scheduling requests.
[apologetic] I do see the notes here, Ms. Coleman. [rapidly] It looks like there was a cancellation in the system that—well, [hesitant] it wasn't properly processed on our end.
[defensive] I understand your frustration, truly. [more quickly] The next available slot with Dr. Martinez is... [pause] December fourteenth at two-thirty. [cautiously] Would that work for you?
[firmly] Let me check for cancellations. [typing quickly] Actually, wait—[more hopefully] if you're flexible, there's a seven AM slot next Tuesday that just opened up.
[reassuring] I'm booking it right now, confirming it in the system. [more slowly] You'll receive a text and email confirmation within five minutes. [professionally] Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Coleman?
[confidently] Dr. Martinez will definitely be here Tuesday. [quickly] She never misses her early morning slots—actually, [more warmly] she prefers them because it's quieter in the office.
[briskly] Bring copies just in case. [helpfully] Our system shows we received some documents, but [more carefully] it's always better to have physical backups for the specialist to review.
[sympathetically] Actually, before seven-thirty, parking is free in the structure. [more cheerfully] So your early appointment works out perfectly—[quickly] no hunting for spots, no paying meters.
[efficiently] Exactly right, third floor of the medical building. [rapidly] Check in at the specialist desk, not general reception—[emphasizing] that's important, it saves you about ten minutes.
[warmly] It will happen, Ms. Coleman. [reassuringly] I've put priority flags on your appointment, and [more firmly] you should get those confirmations any moment now. Have a great rest of your day.
[Slow] Good evening everyone, I'm so honored to be—wait, no, that's too formal. [Tsk] Let me try that again with, like, more energy.
[Happy] Okay, this is it, you've got this! [Fast] Just remember to breathe, make eye contact, and don't forget the joke about the chicken!
[Whisper] Why did I agree to do this? [Sigh] I mean, honestly, I could just call in sick tomorrow and nobody would even—no, stop it.
[Angry] The statistics clearly show that we're—ugh, I sound like a robot! [Groan] Nobody wants to hear numbers for twenty minutes straight!
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, let's open with a quote from Gandhi, because that's never been done before. [Chuckle] Really groundbreaking stuff there, genius.
[Disappointed] I've been practicing for three weeks and I still can't get through the middle part without, um, completely blanking out. [Sigh]
[Fast] [Happy] And that's when everything changed—boom! [Laugh] See, I told you this story would blow your minds, right?
[Slow] In conclusion... [Tsk] No wait, that sounds like I'm wrapping up a high school essay or something.
[Shout] Ladies and gentlemen! [Happy] Welcome to—actually is that too loud? I don't wanna, like, scare people right off the bat.
[Sad] [Whisper] What if I just completely freeze up there and everyone's staring at me and I can't even remember my own name?
[Fast] Um, so basically what I'm trying to say is—no, that's too wishy-washy. [Angry] Just get to the point already!
[Chuckle] You know what, forget the notecards. [Happy] I'm just gonna wing it and see what happens, I mean, how bad could it really go?
[Disappointed] This tie makes me look like I'm going to a funeral, doesn't it? [Sigh] Great, now I gotta figure out what else to wear.
[Slow] [Sarcastic] Thank you sooo much for this incredible opportunity to speak about quarterly revenue projections. [Tsk] Thrilling stuff, truly.
[Whisper] [Sad] Remember when you used to be good at this? When you could just, like, talk to people without your hands shaking?
[Happy] Oh man, they're gonna love the part where I talk about the—wait, did I remember to print the handouts? [Groan] [Fast] Please tell me I printed them!
[Angry] Stop saying "um" every five seconds! [Disappointed] It's literally the one thing the coach told you not to do, and here you are, um—dammit!
[Slow] Before we begin, I'd like to acknowledge... [Chuckle] Nah, that sounds way too presidential for a sales presentation, doesn't it?
[Shout] [Happy] Yes! Nailed that transition! [Laugh] Finally got from point A to point B without sounding like a complete disaster!
[Sarcastic] [Fast] Sure, compare yourself to Steve Jobs, that's not pretentious at all—I mean, you're basically the same person, right? [Tsk]
SCENARIO: Frustrated about a parking garage, then remembers they parked on a different level
I'm not—what? I'm not changing anything, I'm literally just telling you what I remember. Like, maybe we just saw it differently or something, I dunno.
Because I didn't! I mean—okay, we talked about relationships in general, but I never specifically said you and Tyler broke up. That's not the same thing [scoff] and you know it.
Look look, I don't—I honestly don't remember every single conversation word for word, okay? You're acting like I'm deliberately trying to mess with you, which is kinda hurtful actually.
That's not—come on, that's not fair. Sometimes people just remember things differently. It doesn't mean I'm lying to you or whatever you're implying here. [frustrated laugh] I mean, your memory isn't perfect either.
I'm not turning—ugh, see, this is what you do. I try to explain that maybe, just maybe, we both remember things our own way, and suddenly I'm the bad guy who's "turning things around."
Okay okay, I said I left earli-ER, not early. There's a difference. And midnight was early considering everyone else stayed till like three. You're picking apart every little word I say.
No, because you're looking for problems! [sigh] Like, I get that you're upset, but honestly? You're making me feel like I can't even talk about anything without you thinking I'm some kind of—I dunno, manipulator or something.
Oh my god, I'm not gaslighting you! We literally just remember it differently. That happens between people all the time—it's normal, it's human, it's not some conspiracy against you.
You know what? Fine. Fine fine. If you wanna believe I'm this terrible friend who's out to get you, then—I can't stop you. But I'm kinda disappointed that after everything, this is what you think of me.
And I want you to consider that maybe—just maybe—I'm not lying, and we both just have different memories of the same thing. But apparently that's too much to ask for.
SCENARIO: trying to figure out the self-checkout machine
[bitter] Oh look who finally graced us with their presence. [sarcastically] Did Mom have to bribe you to leave your perfect apartment, or did you just come for the presents? [Scoff] I'm sure yours are already wrapped in gold foil.
[rising anger] Imaginary? [Harsh laugh] You got a car for graduation while I got a gift card! [faster] Dad flew to every one of your games but missed my valedictorian speech for your JV soccer tournament.
[mockingly sweet] Oh, poor golden child, [dripping sarcasm] burdened by all that unconditional love and support. [Bitter chuckle] Must be so hard having every door opened for you before you even knock on it.
[explosive] Feel worse about myself? [Gasp] I got into medical school on my own while you—[accusingly] you had Dad make calls to his golf buddies to land that consulting job you barely qualified for!
And I get both of those things, I really do. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you're more focused on being mad than on—whatever, forget it. I said I was sorry, my mom's okay now, can we just... move past this?
Oh god, okay—I know you're mad. I'm so so sorry, I meant to bring it back last week but then my car broke down and I—wait, that's not an excuse, I know.
I know, I know! Three months is—that's inexcusable, honestly. I kept meaning to return it but then I'd forget and—[groan] no, that sounds terrible. I wasn't forgetting about YOU, I swear, just the actual act of bringing it.
Please don't—okay, I can hear how mad you are and you have every right to be. That necklace is literally irreplaceable and I just left it sitting in my jewelry box like it was nothing when it's—it's not nothing, obviously.
I know. God, I know and I feel like such an absolute—I'm the worst friend ever. Like genuinely, who borrows something that important and just... [nervous laugh] apparently me. I'm that person.
I actually—I have it in my car right now. I've been carrying it around for two weeks trying to find the right time to apologize but there's no good time for "hey, sorry I'm basically the worst person alive," y'know?
That sounds—okay that sounds bad when you say it like that. But I wrapped it really carefully! Like, it's in the original box, then bubble wrap, then another box. I was paranoid about it getting damaged so I kinda went overboard with the protection.
Wait, does that—are you maybe like, slightly less furious? Because I will literally run to my car right now and get it. Actually, I'm gonna do that anyway—hold on, just give me two seconds.
No no, I'm running. I'm—actually I'm already halfway there. [slightly out of breath] I should've just brought it to your door the second I put it in my car but I was scared you'd slam it in my face. Which, um, fair.
You wouldn't? Even though I'm literally the most irresponsible—okay, getting it now. It's right here, perfectly safe. See? Not a single scratch or anything, I promise.
I really am sorry. Like, deeply genuinely sorry. I know it's not just a necklace—it's your grandma and I should've treated it that way from the beginning. I'm just... I'm really sorry.
