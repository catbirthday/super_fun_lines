Character 1: So I got cast in that play.

244 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? You auditioned? And you didn't—oh my god, you didn't even tell me you were gonna try out! What play? What part? Tell me literally everything right now.

Character 1: It's just community theater. Nothing big.

245 Character 2: Okay no no no, don't do that. Don't like, minimize this! You got cast in a play! That's—that's huge! I mean, when's the last time you did anything like this?

Character 1: High school. Maybe fifteen years ago.

246 Character 2: Fifteen—[Gasp] okay that makes this even more amazing! Like, you just walked in there after all that time and... wait, what made you even audition? This is so not like you.

Character 1: I don't know. Saw the flyer. Thought why not.

247 Character 2: "Why not?" You're kidding me. You're so—ugh, you're being so casual about this but I know you, okay? This is brave. Like really, really brave. What's the play though? Shakespeare? Something modern?

Character 1: It's Arsenic and Old Lace. I'm playing Mortimer.

248 Character 2: Shut up—that's the lead! That's literally the lead role! How are you just sitting there like—I mean, aren't you kinda freaking out? Even a little bit? [Laugh] Because I'm freaking out for you.

Character 1: Maybe a little.

249 Character 2: Okay good, good, because honestly? I was starting to worry you were like, a robot or something. When do rehearsals start? Oh god, do you have to memorize a ton of lines?

Character 1: Next week. And yes. A lot of lines.

250 Character 2: Are you—wait, are you nervous? You seem nervous. Which is totally normal, by the way. I'd be like, completely losing my mind right now if it were me.

Character 1: I haven't acted in front of people in years. What if I forget everything?

251 Character 2: Okay, first of all? You won't. And second—even if you do stumble a bit, that's what rehearsals are for, right? Like, nobody expects you to be perfect on day one. [Sigh] God, I'm so proud of you though.

Character 1: It might be a mistake.

252 Character 2: No—nope, we're not doing the self-doubt thing. You auditioned because some part of you wanted this, y'know? And they picked you! Out of probably, what, tons of people? That means something.

Character 1: I guess. Opening night's in six weeks.

253 Character 2: Six weeks! Okay okay, I'm gonna be there—front row, probably crying, definitely embarrassing you. But like, in a supportive way? Oh my god, can I bring people? I wanna bring everyone.

Script: 3a7dffa6_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You shared my location with Mark.

254 Character 2: Wait, what? How did you—okay, yeah, I did, but it wasn't like... I mean, you were walking home alone at 2 AM and you weren't answering your phone. I was worried.

Character 1: I said share it with YOU. For emergencies.

255 Character 2: And it was an emergency! You literally disappeared for like three hours, and Mark was with me when I was freaking out about it. What was I supposed to—just sit there and panic by myself?

Character 1: Yes. That's exactly what you do.

256 Character 2: That's—come on, that's ridiculous. [Scoff] You're seriously telling me that if you thought I was in danger, you'd just... what, respect my privacy while I'm potentially bleeding in a ditch somewhere?

Character 1: I wasn't in a ditch. I was at Katie's.

257 Character 2: Yeah, well, I didn't know that! You said you were going straight home, and then your location showed you in some random neighborhood for hours. I'm not gonna apologize for caring about whether you're—look, fine, maybe I shouldn't have shown Mark, but honestly? You're being kinda unfair here.

Character 1: Unfair? You gave him access to track me whenever.

258 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I didn't give him access to anything. I showed him my phone screen, once, because I was literally about to call the cops. [Frustrated laugh] But sure, make me the villain here.

Character 1: Did you tell him about Katie?

259 Character 2: What? No! God, of course not. I'm not—okay, I get that you're mad about the location thing, but I'm not like, betraying all your secrets here. I made one judgment call because I thought you were in trouble.

Character 1: One judgment call that wasn't yours to make.

260 Character 2: Okay okay, fine, but you're acting like I did this to hurt you or—I dunno, violate your trust for fun? I was scared. Like, genuinely scared something happened to you. And yeah, maybe I panicked, but you can't just—

Character 1: I can't what?

261 Character 2: You can't just expect me to be perfect all the time! I'm trying here, I really am, but you're not even—[sigh] you're not even trying to understand why I did it. You just wanna be mad.

Character 1: I have every right to be mad.

262 Character 2: Yeah, you do. Fine. But I have a right to be frustrated too, y'know? Like, I'm sorry I involved Mark, I am, but I'm also kinda disappointed that you think I'd ever intentionally put you at risk or whatever.

Character 1: That's not the point.

263 Character 2: Then what is the point? Because honestly, I feel like—look, if you wanna stay mad, stay mad. But I did what I thought was right in the moment, and I'd probably do it again if I thought you were in danger. So... yeah.

Script: 3b6198b0_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: So I won that chili thing yesterday.

264 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you WON? Like, actually won won? Oh my god, I knew you were gonna enter but I didn't—this is amazing! How many people were competing?

Character 1: Forty-seven.

265 Character 2: Forty-sev—okay that's like, that's basically professional level! Were there actual judges or was it just, y'know, random people voting? Because either way that's [Gasp] honestly incredible.

Character 1: Three judges. One was a restaurant critic.

266 Character 2: Stop it. A restaurant critic ate your chili and—and what, just crowned you the winner? Did they say anything? Like, specifically about yours?

Character 1: Said it had "complex heat with surprising depth." Direct quote.

267 Character 2: Complex heat with—okay okay, you're trying to be all casual about this but that's literally, that's what they write about fancy restaurants! Did you use that recipe you were, um, the one with the chocolate?

Character 1: Modified it. Added coffee grounds.

268 Character 2: Coffee grounds in— [Laugh] of course you did. Of course. So like, what did you win? Please tell me there's a trophy or something ridiculous.

Character 1: Five hundred dollars and a golden ladle.

269 Character 2: A golden—I'm sorry, did you just say a golden ladle? That's the most—wait, do you have it? Can I see it? This is like, basically your superhero origin story.

Character 1: It's in my car. It's plastic spray-painted gold.

270 Character 2: Even better, honestly. That's so perfectly ridiculous. Are you gonna—I mean, you gotta display that somewhere, right? Kitchen wall? Maybe above the stove?

Character 1: My mom wants to put it in her china cabinet.

271 Character 2: Your mom—oh my god, stop, that's actually adorable. She must be like, totally losing her mind proud right now. Did she know you were even competing?

Character 1: I told her this morning. She cried.

272 Character 2: She cried? Okay that's—that's making ME wanna cry. Your mom's so pure. So what're you gonna do with the money? Five hundred's like, that's real money.

Character 1: Probably more chili ingredients. The good peppers are expensive.

273 Character 2: You're gonna—of course. Of course you're reinvesting in more chili. [Chuckle] You know what? That's kinda perfect. When's the next competition? Because now you're like, defending champion or whatever.

274 SCENARIO: discovering the milk has gone bad after pouring it on cereal

==================================================

[cheerful]

Okay, so, um, cereal time. I'm gonna make this nice bowl of— oh, this is gonna be good. Got my favorite bowl, got the, uh, the good cereal, and now we just need some— some milk to make this whole situation, um, complete.

[casual]

Alright, so we pour the milk and— [pause] huh. That's, um, that's not the right color. That's not— is that supposed to look like that? I mean, milk is supposed to be white, right, not like, uh, not chunky and weird and—

[slightly disgusted]

Oh. Oh no. [tsk] That's— that's definitely bad milk. Like, really bad milk. I can smell it from here, which is, um, which is not a good sign. Not a good sign at all.

[resigned]

So now I have this perfectly good bowl of cereal that's just, uh, just sitting there being inedible because I didn't— I didn't check the expiration date like a normal person. [sigh] When did I even buy this milk? Was it last week? Two weeks ago?

[muttering]

Okay, so, um, do I just throw the whole thing away or can I, like, pick out the cereal? That seems gross, right? The milk touched everything, so it's all contaminated now.

[matter-of-fact]

Right, so, trash it is. [exhale] Guess I'm having toast for breakfast. Or, um, dry cereal, which is just sad. Maybe I should just go get coffee instead and pretend this never—

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: a0430519 | Role: Character 1 (A)

275 Character 1: [voice breaking] I can't believe it's been fifty years, Margaret. [softer] Look at all these people here for us. [Shaky breath] When I first saw you in that yellow sundress at the county fair, I never imagined we'd make it this far.

Character 2: [trembling whisper] Oh Harold, stop it, you're going to make me ruin my makeup. [louder, laughing] Remember how you were too shy to ask me to dance? [warmly] Your friend Tommy had to practically shove you toward me at that bandstand.

276 Character 1: [defensive chuckle] I wasn't shy, I was being strategic! [quieter] You were the prettiest girl there, and I needed the perfect moment. [Clearing throat] Though I suppose waiting three hours wasn't exactly smooth, was it, sweetheart?

Character 2: [teasing tone] Three and a half hours, actually. [more seriously] But when you finally asked, your hands were shaking so badly. [Soft sigh] That's when I knew you were different from all those other boys trying to impress me.

277 Character 1: [nostalgic whisper] Our first apartment was the size of this dance floor. [getting louder] Remember the radiator that clanged all night? [Gentle laugh] We'd lie awake planning our future, never knowing if we could afford next month's groceries.

Character 2: [wistful] Those were the best conversations we ever had, weren't they? [voice cracking] Before the kids, before the mortgages. [steadier] Just two dreamers with a leaky ceiling and more love than sense in our hearts.

278 Character 1: [proudly] Look at our grandbabies dancing over there. [more emotionally] Little Sarah has your eyes, you know. [Choking up] Sometimes I watch her and it's like seeing you at twenty-five all over again, that same fierce spirit.

Character 2: [through tears] Don't you dare make me cry harder, Harold Matthews. [sniffling] When did we get so old? [brightening] Inside, I still feel like that girl who snuck out her bedroom window to meet you at midnight.

279 Character 1: [hushed reverence] You're still that girl to me, Maggie. [stronger] Every morning when I wake up and see your face on that pillow. [Deep breath] Even with your reading glasses on crooked and that face cream everywhere.

Character 2: [mock outrage] Harold! [softer giggle] You're one to talk with your snoring that could wake the dead. [tenderly] But I wouldn't trade a single sleepless night if it meant not having you beside me all these years.

280 Character 1: [seriously] We almost didn't make it through year seven, remember? [quieter] After we lost the baby. [Wavering voice] I thought the grief would swallow us whole, but somehow we held each other up through that darkness.

Character 2: [barely audible] That was our hardest season. [gaining strength] But you never let go of my hand, not once. [firmly] That's when I knew we could survive anything this life threw at us, as long as we faced it together.

281 Character 1: [brightening] And we did, didn't we? [enthusiastically] Four beautiful children, seven grandkids, that cross-country RV trip you always dreamed about. [Soft chuckle] Even if I did get us lost in Nevada for two whole days without cell service.

Character 2: [playful scolding] Because someone refused to ask for directions! [more gently] But those two days were magical, weren't they? [dreamily] Just us and the stars and that old radio playing songs from when we were young.

282 Character 1: [thoughtfully] If I could do it all over again, know what I'd change? [pause, then firmly] Absolutely nothing. [voice thick] Every triumph, every mistake, every ordinary Tuesday led us right here to this golden moment together.

Character 2: [overwhelmed] Harold, you beautiful fool, now you've done it. [Sobbing laugh] My mascara is completely ruined. [collecting herself] But you're right, every single day with you has been worth it, even the hard ones.

283 Character 1: [intimate whisper] Dance with me, Maggie? [more boldly] Like we did at our wedding when the band played our song? [hopefully] My knees might creak a bit more, but I can still hold you just as close.

Character 2: [touched] Of course, my love. [playfully warning] But if you step on my feet like you did then, [Warm laugh] I'm sending you to dance with your sister Ruth instead, and you know how she leads!

284 Character 1: [joyfully] Come here, you wonderful woman. [quieter, emotional] Thank you for choosing me all those years ago. [Breaking voice] Thank you for keeping on choosing me every day since, through everything life has given us.

Character 2: [through happy tears] Oh Harold, we chose each other. [stronger] And I'd choose you again in every lifetime. [Contented sigh] Now stop making speeches and spin me around before our grandson plays that awful techno music again.

Script: ac1bac5a | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [hesitant] Um, hi, I received this contract in my email yesterday for membership ID GYM-4827-B, but I'm... [pause] I'm not really sure about some of these terms? [nervously] The cancellation policy on page 3, section 2.4 seems pretty strict.

285 Customer Support: Oh absolutely, I'd be happy to go over that with you! So the 30-day notice requirement is standard, but we do have flexibility for medical emergencies or if you move more than 25 miles from our location at 1847 Fitness Boulevard.

Character 1: [skeptical] Thirty days though? [sighs] What about this annual fee of $49.99 that's mentioned in—wait, let me find it—[muttering] clause 5.2A? Nobody mentioned that when I toured last week with, um, was it Jessica?

286 Customer Support: Ah yes, the facility enhancement fee. That's charged every January 15th and covers equipment upgrades and maintenance. [brightening] But since you're signing up in November, you won't see that charge for over a year!

Character 1: [frustrated] Okay but this auto-renewal clause in paragraph 7... [slower] it says my credit card on file, the one ending in 8924, gets charged automatically? [worried tone] What if I want to just pay month-to-month without the whole binding thing?

287 Customer Support: I totally get that concern! [more enthusiastically] We actually do offer a month-to-month option under plan code MTM-FLEX-2024. It's $79.99 instead of the $54.99 annual commitment rate, but there's no long-term obligation whatsoever.

Character 1: [calculating] So that's like... [pause] twenty-five dollars more per month? [groans] And what about this personal training assessment that's listed as "complimentary" in addendum B-1? [suspiciously] Is that actually free or is there some catch?

288 Customer Support: [laughing gently] No catch at all, I promise! [warmly] That's a genuine free session with one of our certified trainers, booking code PT-INTRO-FREE. [more seriously] Now, if you want additional sessions after that, those are $65 each or $240 for a four-pack.

Character 1: [overwhelmed] This freeze policy in section 9.3 says I can freeze for medical reasons with form MED-FREEZE-A? [confused] But then it mentions a $15 monthly hold fee? [incredulous] So I'm paying to not use the gym?

289 Customer Support: The freeze fee keeps your membership rate locked and your account active. Without it, you'd have to re-enroll at current rates which could be higher. [softer] Plus, medical freezes with doctor's notes actually waive that fee entirely—that's policy exception code MED-EXEMPT.

Character 1: [interested] Oh, that's... that's actually better. [pause] Wait, what about this thing about peak hours? [reading] "Premium access hours between 5-8pm Monday through Thursday require upgrade package PEAK-ADD"? [annoyed] Are you telling me I can't work out after work?

290 Customer Support: No no no, you can definitely work out then! That's only for reserving specific equipment or classes during those times. [reassuringly] Walk-in access is always included, though our Zumba and spin classes at 6pm do fill up fast.

Character 1: [considering] Hmm, and this liability waiver in exhibit C... [nervous laugh] It's like three pages long with reference number LIAB-2024-STANDARD-V3. [worried] Am I basically signing away all my rights if something happens?

291 Customer Support: That's our standard insurance requirement, but [more casually] it doesn't cover gross negligence on our part or equipment we know is broken. There's also supplementary accident insurance for $4.99 monthly under add-on code ACC-PROTECT if you want extra coverage.

Character 1: [sighs deeply] This guest pass section, clause 11.2B, says I get two free passes per month? [hopefully] Can I use both on the same day, like if my roommate wants to try it out with me at apartment 4B on Maple Street?

292 Customer Support: Unfortunately they're meant to be spread out, one per 15-day period actually. But here's a tip—if your roommate mentions your name and member ID during their tour, you both get a $25 credit under referral code REF-BUDDY-25!

Character 1: [tired] Okay, last thing—[pause] this arbitration clause in the final section, case number ARB-GYM-STANDARD... [slowly] Does this mean I can't ever sue you guys even if, I don't know, the ceiling falls on me?

293 Customer Support: [chuckling] Well, we certainly hope our ceiling stays put! Personal injury claims are actually excluded from arbitration under exception code PI-EXCLUDE. [reassuring] Only billing disputes and membership issues go through arbitration, which honestly is usually faster anyway.

Character 1: [decisively] Alright, you know what? [exhales] I think I'll do the month-to-month for now, the MTM-FLEX-2024 plan. [cautiously] Can we add that accident insurance thing too, and [pause] maybe schedule that free training assessment for next week?

294 Customer Support: Perfect, let me set that all up for you! I'll email you confirmation number CONF-112024-MTM-4827B within the hour. Your training assessment is booked for Tuesday the 14th at 3pm with Marcus, and welcome to the FlexFit family!

295 Customer Support: Thank you for calling Premium Rewards, my name is Sandra. How can I assist you with your account today?

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, hi, I just logged into my account and—I can't believe this—all my points are gone! [louder] Twenty-three thousand points just vanished, what is going on here?

296 Customer Support: I understand your concern, let me pull up your account right away. Can you provide your member number or the phone number associated with—actually, wait, I see it here on my screen already.

Character 1: [impatiently] Good, because I've been saving those for two years for a flight to Hawaii. [sighs heavily] The website says they expired but nobody ever told me points could expire!

297 Customer Support: I see here that, um, the points did expire on October 31st due to eighteen months of account inactivity. Our terms state that points expire after—well, after no earning or redemption activity for that period.

Character 1: [outraged] Inactivity? I bought groceries with your partner stores every single week! [sarcastically] How is that inactive, or does grocery shopping not count anymore in your "premium" program?

298 Customer Support: [hesitantly] Actually, I'm checking and... those grocery purchases weren't, uh, weren't coded as qualifying transactions. Only purchases at our flagship stores or through the app directly count toward keeping points active.

Character 1: [exasperated] Are you serious right now? [groans] The whole reason I signed up was because your advertisement specifically said "earn everywhere you shop."

299 Customer Support: I completely understand your frustration, and you're right, that is confusing messaging. Let me see if there's anything—actually, I might be able to submit an exception request to my supervisor for a one-time courtesy reinstatement.

Character 1: [skeptically] One-time courtesy? [chuckles bitterly] I've been a member for eight years, spent thousands, and you're acting like you're doing me some huge favor here.

300 Customer Support: No, no, you're absolutely right, and I apologize for how that sounded. Actually, given your loyalty status, I can reinstate seventy-five percent of the points immediately—that's about seventeen thousand points back.

Character 1: [quieter] Seventy-five percent... [sighs] Look, I appreciate that, but what about the other six thousand? That's still a lot of money I spent to earn those.

301 Customer Support: For the remaining points, I'd need to escalate to our retention team, but honestly—between you and me—they usually approve these for long-term members. Can I place you on a brief hold while I transfer?

Character 1: [reluctantly] Fine, but if I get disconnected or have to explain this whole thing again... [more firmly] I'm closing my account and disputing my annual fee, just so you know.

302 Customer Support: No need to transfer actually! I just got approval from my manager who was listening—we'll restore all twenty-three thousand points plus add five thousand bonus points for the inconvenience.

Character 1: [surprised] Oh! Well that's... [chuckles] that's much better, okay. When will I see them back in my account?

303 Customer Support: They're already there, just refresh your app or browser. [quickly] I'm also extending your points expiration by twenty-four months and adding a reminder system to email you ninety days before any future expiration.

Character 1: [relieved] Thank god, someone who actually helps instead of just reading scripts. [more warmly] Sorry for getting heated earlier, Sandra, this whole thing just stressed me out.

304 Customer Support: Oh please, don't apologize—I'd be upset too if my Hawaii trip was in jeopardy! [briskly] Is there anything else I can help you with while I have your account open?

Character 1: [gratefully] No, you've been great, really turned this around. [chuckles] Maybe I'll send a positive review instead of the scathing one I was mentally composing five minutes ago!

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

305 [Nervous] I know it sounds, um, completely irrational, but even just seeing a picture of one makes my heart start racing. [Fast] Like, instantly.

306 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, everyone thinks it's hilarious until they see me have a full-blown panic attack in the produce aisle. [Tsk]

307 [Whisper] Sometimes I dream about them and I—I wake up screaming, y'know? [Slow] My roommate thinks I'm losing it.

308 [Angry] Don't you dare bring one near me! [Shout] I'm serious, I will literally leave and never speak to you again!

309 [Sad] My therapist says it probably started when I was, like, really little, but I honestly can't remember the trigger. [Sigh]

310 [Happy] The good news is I found this support group online and, um, apparently thousands of people have the exact same fear! [Chuckle]

311 [Fast] It's the way they move that gets me—actually, no, it's everything about them, I can't even— [Groan] Why are we talking about this?

312 [Disappointed] I thought exposure therapy would help, but after six months I'm still just as terrified as before. [Slow] Maybe worse, actually.

313 [Whisper] You wanna know something embarrassing? [Fast] I once climbed onto a stranger's shoulders at a party to avoid one.

314 Even my doctor kinda laughed when I told her—I mean, she tried not to, but I could see it. [Sarcastic] [Tsk] Very professional.

315 [Sad] My kids don't understand why mommy can't take them to certain places, and honestly, how do you explain that? [Sigh]

316 [Angry] It's not funny, okay? [Fast] People die from phobias—well, from the stress of phobias, but still!

317 [Happy] I've gotten really creative with avoidance strategies though—like, I'm basically a ninja now when it comes to spotting them first. [Laugh]

318 The physical symptoms are, um, actually the worst part—sweating, shaking, this feeling like I'm gonna pass out or throw up. [Slow] [Groan]

319 [Disappointed] My ex used to tease me about it constantly, which is—yeah, that's part of why they're my ex now. [Tsk]

320 [Shout] Get it away, get it away, GET IT AWAY! [Fast] I don't care if it's fake, I need it gone NOW!

321 [Sarcastic] Sure, let's discuss my deepest fears over coffee, that's exactly what I wanted to do with my Tuesday morning. [Chuckle] But seriously, it sucks.

322 I've tried everything—meditation, hypnosis, those weird tapping techniques, er, even medication for a while. [Disappointed] [Sigh] Nothing really works long-term, y'know?

323 [Whisper] Sometimes I wonder if I'm passing this fear onto my kids just by, like, being so obviously terrified around them. [Sad] That keeps me up at night.

324 [Happy] You know what though? [Slow] I've learned to just own it—yeah, I'm scared of something ridiculous, but we've all got our things, right?

325 SCENARIO: Complaining about a slow computer, then clearing the cache fixes it instantly

==================================================

[frustrated]

Dude, I almost threw my laptop out the window today. Like literally, I was— I was this close to just chucking it across the room because it was being so [groan] so impossibly slow.

[annoyed]

Every single thing I clicked on took like thirty seconds to load. Thirty seconds! I'm trying to get this presentation done and I click on a file and then I'm just sitting there like... waiting. And waiting.

Chrome was basically frozen, Word was lagging, even just opening a folder was taking forever.

[increasingly agitated]

And of course this happens on the day I have a deadline, right? Like of course. I'm refreshing emails and it's just that little spinning wheel of death, over and over, and I'm like losing my mind because I need to send this thing by five and—

[realization dawning] [surprised]

Oh wait. Wait wait wait. I just— hold on, let me try clearing the cache real quick. I know you always say to do that first but I always forget and—

[amazed] [slightly sheepish]

Holy shit. It's... it's completely fine now. Everything's running perfectly.

[half laugh] God, I'm an idiot. I spent like two hours cursing at this thing when the fix took literally ten seconds.

[grateful] [embarrassed]

You're gonna be so smug about this, but thank you for always telling me to clear the cache first. I should probably, uh, write that down somewhere.
