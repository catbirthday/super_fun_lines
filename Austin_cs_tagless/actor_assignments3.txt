Character 1: We need to talk about your attitude.

172 Character 2: Oh—oh no, what did I do? Wait, is this about yesterday? Because I didn't mean to—I was just having a really bad day and I know that's not an excuse but—

Character 1: It's every day. Every single thing is negative with you.

173 Character 2: That's not—okay, maybe I've been a little pessimistic lately? But like, work has been insane and my car broke down and—[nervous laugh] sorry, I'm doing it again, aren't I?

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

174 Character 2: God, I'm—I'm really sorry. I honestly didn't realize how bad it's gotten. Like, I guess I've just been so caught up in my own stuff that I didn't notice I was being such a downer all the time.

Character 1: It's exhausting being around you lately.

175 Character 2: Oh. Oh wow, that's—[quiet] that really hurts to hear but you're probably right. I mean, you are right. I wouldn't wanna hang out with me either if all I did was complain about everything.

Character 1: I tried bringing up good news yesterday. You immediately found something wrong with it.

176 Character 2: Wait wait wait, what good news? The promotion thing? I thought I was being—no, you're right, I totally said something about how they'd probably just give you more work without more pay, didn't I? [groan] God, I'm the worst.

Character 1: That's exactly what you said.

177 Character 2: I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry. I think I've been so miserable that I just—I dunno, maybe I wanted everyone else to be miserable too? Which is super toxic and awful and I hate that I've been doing that to you.

Character 1: I just want my friend back. The one who used to be fun.

178 Character 2: No no no, you're right, you're absolutely right. I used to be—we used to have so much fun together and now I'm just this like, emotional vampire or whatever. I gotta—I need to work on this. I really do.

Character 1: I miss hanging out without everything turning into a complaint session.

179 Character 2: Yeah, I—I miss that too, actually. I miss being happy? If that makes sense? Like somewhere along the way I just got stuck in this pattern and I couldn't—[sigh] I'm gonna try to be better. I promise.

Character 1: You say that, but will you actually try?

180 Character 2: Yes. Yes, I will. And y'know what? You can call me out on it. Like, seriously, if I start being negative about something just—just tell me to shut up. I mean it. I clearly need someone to keep me in check because I can't even hear myself anymore.

Character 1: Okay. I'll hold you to that.

181 Character 2: Good. Please do. And um, thank you for—for telling me instead of just ghosting me or whatever. I know it must've been hard to bring this up, but I'm really glad you did. I wanna be better. For both of us, y'know?

Script: 45ef2134_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You walked right past me.

182 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know how that looked. I know. But it wasn't—I wasn't trying to ignore you, I swear. There were just all these people from work there and I got so weird about it.

Character 1: You literally looked through me.

183 Character 2: No no no, that's not—okay, yeah, I did look away. [nervous laugh] But it was like, my boss was standing right there and she doesn't know I'm friends with anyone from—it's complicated, okay?

Character 1: It's not complicated. You're embarrassed of me.

184 Character 2: What? No! That's not—I'm not embarrassed of you, are you kidding? I just—I panicked. You know how I get when worlds collide, like when different friend groups mix? I literally freeze up.

Character 1: We've been friends for three years.

185 Character 2: I know, I know, and that makes it so much worse, right? Like, I can't believe I did that to you. I was gonna come find you after but then you'd already left and I just—[groan] I'm such an idiot.

Character 1: Yeah. You are.

186 Character 2: I deserve that. I really do. But honestly? It had nothing to do with you and everything to do with me being a coward about my stupid work people judging my personal life.

Character 1: That's supposed to make me feel better?

187 Character 2: No! No, that's—ugh, I'm explaining this so badly. What I mean is, you're like, one of my favorite people, y'know? And I let my weird anxiety brain take over and I hurt you and that's—that's unforgivable, basically.

Character 1: I felt like nothing.

188 Character 2: Oh god. [quieter] I'm so, so sorry. That's the last thing I—you're not nothing. You're literally everything. I mean, not everything but like—you know what I mean. You matter so much to me.

Character 1: Could've fooled me.

189 Character 2: I know. And I've been thinking about it nonstop since Saturday and I just—I wanna make it right. Whatever you need me to do. I'll tell my boss we're friends, I'll—I dunno, buy you coffee for a year?

Character 1: I don't want your coffee. I wanted you to acknowledge I exist.

190 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right. And next time—there's gonna be a next time, right? Please? Next time I promise I'll introduce you to everyone. Like, "This is my friend who I absolutely did not pretend not to see that one time."

Character 1: That's not funny yet.

191 Character 2: Yeah, fair. Too soon. But seriously, I—I really am sorry. And I know sorry doesn't fix it but I'm gonna do better. I promise. No more weird work panic, no more pretending you're invisible. Just... please don't give up on me?

192 SCENARIO: realizing they've been on mute during a video call

==================================================

[muttering]

Okay, so I was just, um— I was making all these really good points about the quarterly reports and, uh, and everyone's just sitting there staring at me like— like I'm crazy or something. Which is, um, which is weird because I thought I was being pretty, you know, pretty articulate for once.

[realization dawning]

Wait. Wait wait wait. [exhale] Oh no. The little, uh, the little microphone icon— is that— that's got a line through it, doesn't it. [groan] That's the mute thing. That means I'm— oh god, I'm muted, aren't I.

[slightly panicked]

How long have I been— I mean, I was talking for like, what, three minutes? Four minutes? About the budget allocation and the, um, the staffing issues, and they're all just— they probably think I'm just moving my mouth like some kind of, uh, like some kind of broken puppet or something.

[embarrassed but trying to laugh it off]

Okay, so now I have to, um, I have to unmute and just pretend like— like that didn't happen. Or do I acknowledge it? Do people acknowledge the mute thing? [sigh] This is why I hate technology.

[resigned]

Right. Okay. Just gonna, um, just gonna click this little button here and— and maybe make a little joke about it. Everyone does this, right? This is, uh, this is totally normal. [nervous laugh] Totally fine.

--- CONVERSATION ---

Script: db64f71e | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: [nervously] Um, Brad? [higher pitch] Is that you? [confused whisper] You look really different from your photos—like, completely different actually. Were those pictures from a while ago or something? I mean, you're still nice looking, just not what I expected at all.

193 Character 2: [defensive] Yeah, well, those were from my modeling days. [mumbling] About fifteen years ago. [louder, rushed] But personality matters more than looks, right? That's what everyone says online anyway. You said you valued honesty and deep connections over superficial things, remember?

Character 1: [shocked] Fifteen YEARS? [voice cracking] Brad, you said you were thirty-two! [quieter, hurt] This is exactly the kind of dishonesty I can't handle. How old are you really? And what else did you lie about on your profile? Your job? Your hobbies?

194 Character 2: [sheepishly] I'm forty-seven. [long sigh] The CEO thing might be a stretch too. [more confidently] But I do work at a tech company! Just in the mailroom. Look, can we just order some drinks and start over? Please?

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, what's next? [increasingly agitated] You don't actually have that beach house in Malibu either? [bitter laugh] Let me guess—you live with your mother in Van Nuys and that Ferrari in your profile belongs to your neighbor.

195 Character 2: [quietly defensive] It's my cousin's Ferrari. [pleading tone] And Reseda, not Van Nuys. [desperately faster] But I'm saving up for my own place! Mom's just helping me through a rough patch. Everyone needs support sometimes, right? You understand that, don't you?

Character 1: [exhausted sigh] You know what? [steadier voice] I drove forty minutes in traffic for this. [resigned] We're here now, so let's just have one drink. But after this, please don't contact me again. This whole thing feels like a bad sitcom episode.

196 Character 2: [enthusiastically] One drink, yes! [nervous chuckle] I promise you'll see the real me. [warmly] The profile stuff was just marketing, you know? Everyone exaggerates online. I bet you used filters on your photos too, right? We all do it!

Character 1: [offended] Filters? [incredulous] I maybe brightened one photo! [firmly] There's a huge difference between good lighting and completely fabricating your entire existence, Brad. Or wait—is your name even Brad? At this point, I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.

197 Character 2: [mumbled admission] It's Bernard. [quick exhale] Brad sounded cooler. [hopefully] But my middle name is Bradley! So it's not technically a complete lie, right? Come on, you're laughing—that's good! See, we can make this work! I'm actually pretty funny.

Character 1: [disbelieving laughter] This is insane! [slower, amazed] I'm literally being catfished in real time. [amused despite herself] My friends are never going to believe this story. Wait, did you at least really like hiking? Or was that whole outdoorsy thing fake too?

198 Character 2: [hesitantly] Define "hiking." [defensive mumble] Walking to the bus stop counts, right? [more animated] But I do love nature documentaries! That's basically the same thing. Plus, no bugs or sweating. It's actually better if you really think about it objectively.

Character 1: [giggling now] Stop, just stop! [breathlessly amused] This is so absurd it's almost entertaining. [curious whisper] Okay, Bernard, level with me—was anything in your profile actually true? Your favorite movie? The charity work? That inspirational quote about following dreams?

199 Character 2: [proudly] The quote was real! [softer] I mean, I got it from a fortune cookie. [cheerfully] And I did volunteer once! It was court-ordered community service, but still counts. Hey, you're not leaving—that's progress! Should we order appetizers?

Character 1: [still laughing] Court-ordered? [gasping] Oh my god, what did you do? [cautiously intrigued] You know what, Bernard? You're a disaster, but at least you're an entertaining disaster. One drink and apps, but that's it. This is purely for the story now.

200 Character 2: [relieved exhale] Unpaid parking tickets, nothing serious! [excitedly faster] Yes, appetizers! [genuine tone] Look, I know I messed up with the profile thing. But sitting here with you, talking like this—isn't this kind of fun? More fun than I usually am, honestly.

Character 1: [thoughtfully] You know what's weird? [surprised admission] You're more interesting as Bernard the mailroom disaster than Brad the CEO. [firm but kind] Still completely inappropriate to lie like that though. Some people might find the real you charming. Not me, but someone might.

201 Character 2: [hopefully] Not you? [playful tone] But you're still sitting here! [encouraged whisper] And you just called me charming, sort of. That's better than my last three dates combined. They all left before the drinks arrived. You're actually pretty cool about this whole thing.

Character 1: [warmly exasperated] Don't push it, Bernard. [chuckle] I'm here for the mozzarella sticks and the story. [more seriously] But honestly? Next time just be yourself from the start. The lies are so much worse than whatever truth you're hiding from people.

202 Character 2: [sincerely] You're right. [soft admission] The lying is exhausting anyway. [hopefully lighter] Hey, since we're being honest—your profile said you love jazz, but I saw you scroll past Miles Davis on your phone. Country music fan? Because that's actually something we'd have in common!

Script: b2c50938 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [confused] Hi, yes, I'm calling about my Medicare plan—I got this letter about Part D and Part B, but [sighs heavily] I thought I already had both? [slower] My member ID is, uh, M47829-XL-2024.

203 Customer Support: Thank you for calling Medicare support, I can help clarify that for you. Let me pull up your account using that member ID. Can you verify your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security?

Character 1: [hesitant] It's March 15th, 1955, and the social is... [pause] 6-7-8-9. [frustrated] But what I don't understand is why I'm getting bills from two different places—one says $174.70 and another says $47.20?

204 Customer Support: I see your confusion, Mr. Johnson. [clearer tone] The $174.70 is your standard Part B premium for medical coverage, while [deliberately] the $47.20 is for your Part D prescription drug plan through SilverScript, plan code SS-078A.

Character 1: [exasperated] SilverScript? [louder] I thought I had something called Humana Gold Plus! [groans] My neighbor Betty said she only pays one bill—why do I have seventeen different cards in my wallet?

205 Customer Support: Actually, looking at your file, you do have Humana Gold Plus HMO plan H5619-078. That's what we call a Medicare Advantage plan, which combines your Part A, Part B, and usually Part D into one plan.

Character 1: [bewildered] So wait, wait—if it combines everything, [getting flustered] why am I still paying separate bills? [softer] And what about this notice from CVS Caremark at PO Box 52136 in Phoenix, Arizona 85072?

206 Customer Support: That's likely from your previous prescription coverage before you switched plans. When did you enroll in the Humana plan—was it during the October 15th through December 7th open enrollment period?

Character 1: [uncertain] I think it was... November something? [sighs deeply] My daughter helped me sign up online but [frustrated whisper] the website kept asking for a confirmation code like HUM-2024-AZ-1147 and I don't know if we finished it properly.

207 Customer Support: [concerned] Let me check your enrollment status. It shows here your Humana enrollment was processed November 23rd, effective January 1st, but there might be an overlap issue with your previous Part D carrier causing duplicate billing.

Character 1: [agitated] Duplicate billing! [groans loudly] So I'm paying twice for the same medicines? [desperately] My Metformin prescription alone is costing me $15 here and $12 there—which one do I actually pay?

208 Customer Support: You shouldn't be paying twice, Mr. Johnson. The system shows your old Part D should have terminated December 31st when Humana started. Have you been using your new Humana card with member ID HUMN5478293 at the pharmacy?

Character 1: [overwhelmed] New card? [pause] [confused again] I've been using the same blue and white card for three years—it says Medicare on it and has a number starting with 1EG4?

209 Customer Support: [gently] That's your original Medicare card, which is different from your plan cards. Your Humana card should be red and gray, and you need that specific card for your prescriptions and doctor visits under the Advantage plan.

Character 1: [revelation tone] Oh! [embarrassed chuckle] The red one—I thought that was just for dental! [sighs] My dentist on 445 Elm Street said they don't take Medicare anyway, so I've been paying cash.

210 Customer Support: Actually, your Humana Gold Plus includes dental coverage up to $1,500 annually. You just need to use in-network providers—I can email you a list to your address on file, [checking] is that still robertj1955@aol.com?

Character 1: [surprised] It includes dental? [louder and excited] Why didn't anyone tell me this eight months ago! [deflated] And yes, that's still my email, though [mumbling] I don't check it much since the grandkids set up something called Gmail.

211 Customer Support: I understand the confusion—Medicare can be complex with all these parts and plans. Would you like me to mail you a comprehensive breakdown to 782 Maple Drive, Apartment 4B, Tucson, Arizona 85701?

Character 1: [grateful] Yes, please mail it—I need something on paper I can actually read. [tired] But one more thing, [anxiously] this Medigap thing my friend has, policy G something—should I have that too with everything else?

212 Customer Support: Medigap policies like Plan G don't work with Medicare Advantage plans like your Humana. You have to choose one or the other—Advantage OR Original Medicare with Medigap. [professionally] Would you like to schedule a callback to discuss your options for next enrollment period?

213 Customer Support: Good afternoon, Financial Aid Office, how can I assist you today? I see you're calling about verification documents—let me pull up your file real quick.

Character 1: [frustrated] Yeah, I've submitted my tax forms three times already. [sighs heavily] Every time I check the portal, it says "incomplete" or—or something about missing pages? [confused] I literally sent everything you asked for.

214 Customer Support: Okay, let me check... hmm, I'm seeing here that we received documents on the 5th, the 12th, and yesterday. It looks like the issue is with your parents' W-2 forms—they're coming through blurry.

Character 1: [exasperated] Blurry? Are you kidding me? [groans] I scanned them at the highest resolution possible. [more desperately] Classes start in two weeks and I can't register without my aid package!

215 Customer Support: I understand your frustration, really. Here's what we need—can you take photos with your phone instead? [helpfully] Sometimes that works better than scanning, just make sure there's good lighting, no shadows.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, now you want phone pictures. [sighs] First it was PDFs, then scanned copies, now—now photos? [more anxiously] What if those get rejected too?

216 Customer Support: [reassuringly] They shouldn't be rejected if they're clear and complete. Make sure you're getting all four corners of each document, and upload them as JPEGs, not PDFs this time.

Character 1: [incredulous] JPEGs, not PDFs—nobody told me that before! [louder] How was I supposed to know? [defeated] This whole system is just... it's impossible to navigate.

217 Customer Support: I know it's confusing, we're—we're actually updating our requirements page. For now, just focus on those W-2s, everything else looks good. You should have your package within 48 hours once we verify them.

Character 1: [skeptically] Forty-eight hours, you promise? [sighs] Because last time someone said that, it took a week. [pleading] I really, really need this sorted out—I can't lose my housing assignment.

218 Customer Support: [firmly] I'm putting a priority flag on your account right now. Once you upload those photos—today if possible—I'll personally review them. Would you like me to stay on while you take them?

Character 1: [surprised] You'd do that? [relieved] Actually, yes, that would be—that would be amazing. [nervously] I'm pulling out the documents now, just give me a second.

219 Customer Support: Take your time, I'm not going anywhere. [helpfully] Make sure you're near a window or under a bright light—natural lighting works best. Are those the 2023 forms you have there?

Character 1: [uncertainly] Yeah, 2023... wait, should they be 2024? [panicked] Oh God, please don't tell me I need different ones! [frantically] These are the ones my parents gave me last month.

220 Customer Support: No, no, 2023 is correct for this aid year! You're fine, just checking. Okay, when you're ready, take the first photo and upload it through the portal.

Character 1: [concentrating] Alright, taking it now... uploading... [anxiously] It's spinning, is that normal? [pause] Okay, it says uploaded—can you see it?

221 Customer Support: Perfect! That's crystal clear, much better than before. Now just do the same for the other three forms—your mom's W-2, and both of your dad's. You're doing great.

Character 1: [more confidently] Okay, second one's up... third... [relieved] and the last one. [hopefully] So that's it? That's everything you need from me?

222 Customer Support: Let me just verify... yes, all four documents are perfect! [cheerfully] I'm approving these right now, and—and I'm expediting your review. Check your email tomorrow afternoon for your award letter.

Character 1: [gratefully] Thank you so, so much for your patience. [exhales] I was about ready to just—to give up on this whole thing. [sincerely] You've literally saved my semester.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

223 [Slow] So there's this, um, this hallway that keeps stretching longer every time I try to reach the door at the end. [Whisper] It's terrifying, honestly.

224 [Happy] The weird part is—okay, this sounds crazy—but I can actually fly in it! [Laugh] Like, full-on Superman style, y'know?

225 [Fast] I've been having it since I was, what, twelve maybe, and it's always exactly the same except for this one detail that— [Tsk] Never mind, it's complicated.

226 [Disappointed] My therapist thinks it means something about, uh, unresolved childhood stuff, but I dunno. [Sigh] Seems kinda obvious, doesn't it?

227 [Angry] Why do I always wake up right before I find out who's behind the mask? [Groan] It's so frustrating!

228 [Whisper] There's this voice that calls my name but—wait, I never told anyone this part. [Slow] It sounds exactly like my grandmother who died.

229 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, classic anxiety dream with the whole showing-up-to-work-naked thing, except I'm also covered in peanut butter. [Chuckle] Real subtle, brain.

230 [Fast] Basically every single tooth falls out one by one and I'm trying to catch them but— [Sad] God, it feels so real, like I can taste the blood.

231 [Happy] Sometimes my dog who passed away is there and he's, like, young again and we're just running through this field together. [Sigh] [Slow] I actually don't wanna wake up from those.

232 [Shout] And then the walls start closing in! [Fast] I mean literally crushing everything and I can't—I can't breathe or move!

233 [Disappointed] Y'know what's weird? [Tsk] I can never remember how it starts, just that I'm suddenly already there in that stupid elevator.

234 [Slow] The water rises really gradually, and I'm not even scared, I'm just... [Whisper] I'm just letting it happen, I guess.

235 [Sarcastic] Apparently my subconscious thinks I need to take the same math test every night for twenty years. [Angry] Really creative stuff happening up here! [Tsk]

236 [Chuckle] My ex is always there but with, uh, with octopus arms, which—I mean, make of that what you will, right?

237 [Sad] I keep trying to call 911 but the numbers on the phone won't—they keep changing and shifting around. [Sigh] [Slow] Nobody ever comes to help.

238 [Fast] Okay so basically I'm being chased by something I never actually see, but I know—I just know it's gonna— [Whisper] Actually, I don't wanna think about it.

239 [Happy] The colors though, oh my god, they're like nothing in real life, these sort of, um, electric purples and greens that shouldn't exist! [Laugh]

240 [Angry] Every door leads back to the same damn room! [Groan] It doesn't matter which way I go, it's just—it's like a loop or something.

241 [Disappointed] I dunno why I keep having it when nothing even happens really, just me sitting in this waiting room forever. [Slow] [Sigh] Maybe that's the point.

242 [Whisper] The baby never cries, that's the thing that gets me. [Sad] It just stares with these huge eyes and I wake up feeling like I failed it somehow.

243 SCENARIO: Complaining about an early flight, then having the row to themselves

==================================================

[exhausted]

Oh my God, don't even get me started on this morning. I had to get up at like— at like four-thirty for this stupid six AM flight, and I'm just, I'm dying right now. 

[irritated]

And of course the Uber was late, so I'm like sprinting through the airport with my bag, and I get to the gate and I'm all sweaty and gross, and then— [groan] then they announce a thirty minute delay anyway.

[annoyed]

So I'm sitting there just like fuming, you know? Like why do I do this to myself, I could've taken the ten AM flight, saved myself three hours of sleep, but no, I wanted to "maximize my day" or whatever stupid— 

[surprised]

Oh wait, actually— okay so I'm getting on the plane expecting it to be packed, right? Like it's always packed, but I get to my row and it's just... empty.

[brightening]

Like completely empty. Just me. So I'm looking around like is this real? And the flight attendant comes by and she's like "looks like you hit the jackpot" and I just— [laugh] I stretched out across all three seats.

[content] [slightly sheepish]

I actually slept for like two hours. Best flight I've had in years, honestly. Maybe getting up early isn't always the worst thing? [chuckle] Don't tell anyone I said that.
